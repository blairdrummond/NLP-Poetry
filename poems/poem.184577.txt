Sonnet

            "The English Garden."--Mason
The cold transparent ham is on my fork--
   It hardly rains--and hark the bell!--ding-dingle--
Away! Three thousand feet at gravel work,
   Mocking a Vauxhall shower!--Married and Single
Crush--rush;--Soak'd Silks with wet white Satin mingle.
   Hengler! Madame! round whom all bright sparks lurk
Calls audibly on Mr. and Mrs. Pringle
   To study the Sublime, &c.--(vide Burke)
All Noses are upturn'd!--Whish-ish!--On high
   The rocket rushes--trails--just steals in sight--
Then droops and melts in bubbles of blue light--
   And Darkness reigns--Then balls flare up and die--
Wheels whiz--smack crackers--serpents twist--and then
   Back to the cold transparent ham again!

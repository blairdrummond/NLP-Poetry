1642 Argonne Place, NW
 Alley of giant air conditioners, you roared
 your ill wind our way day and night. We burned
 you down, little house, but you rose right up again.  
 We played guitars by candlelight and sang songs to the cat.
 We stole each other’s cake and dope, dancing
 all night, sleeping late, driving down Columbia
 Road to the Omega for Mexican-style chicken,
 which two lovers could live on for an entire day.
 We threatened you 
 with a sledgehammer
 if you wouldn’t let us go.  
 Enough, you finally stammered,
 be gone from Argonne!  
  
 1920 S St. NW: The Chateau Thierry
 If you opened the door without thinking,
 the entire neighborhood gushed into the apartment
 like an open hydrant.  We gathered around the black
 and white tv  like it was a tabernacle containing
 the secrets we yearned to know.  The first Gay Pride Day
 made the building tremble so violently the roaches
 scurried from the cracks and crevices looking
 for safer quarters.  Theodore, Edward, and Al
 ran the only manual elevator still going in our
 part of town. Casey, violent and crazy, dealt coke
 out of his first floor apartment.  Mara owned
 a dozen petite dogs to be avoided at all costs.
 Zoltan Farkas wrote The Baltimore Poems
 and disappeared completely from the landscape.
 I had a brass bed, my altar of love, and a cat
 named Spooky.  People yelled my name
 up the side of the building, I threw them
 a key out the window, and they rose
 up to the fifth floor and through that open door
 into my abode of bliss, which I still miss.
  
 3701 Massachusetts Ave. NW: Cathedral Court
 They told me I was moving to the geriatric district.
 No Metro up there, they warned.  But I was now
 on top of the hill, across the street from 
 one of God’s most prestigious addresses.
 I would stare at the naked bodies carved above
 the Cathedral entrance, like a page torn from 
 the Playboy version of Genesis, thinking
 yes—this is the way religion should be.
 A bus took me back to Dupont Circle
 in three minutes.  At night I’d walk home
 up Mass Ave, past all the embassies,
 loving to touch down momentarily
 on Irish soil, salute the statue of Gibran,
 great poet of wedding-vow love, hail Mary and Tom
 and Cyn and Steve.  Pick up the mail. 
 Waltz with Susan in the enormous living room,
 then lie in bed at night, by the window,
 hypnotized by the big cake of a church bathed
 in its rosy blush of light, fireworks
 erupting somewhere in the city’s distant dark.

title : Her House

If I am in the house 
beams posts planks siding slate   
protect us 
                Wall 
guard us against the night-terrors 

Floor shore us up above the void below   
cover us roof 
enclose us from the void above 
door keep out the angry stranger 

Hearth cherish the fire   
windows be beacons 
breathe out my warm air chimney 
while I am in the house 

In this room 
my eyes be twelve-paned windows   
clock pump my blood 
cover my nakedness, rug 
curtains be eyelids 
sofa, I rest on your strong thighs 

Where is the soul’s seat? 
Doctors have cut up frogs and not found love.   
Is this my reason? 

I in myself

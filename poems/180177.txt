title : Reading a Memoir at Cedar Island

author : Nicole Pekarske

text : 
We arrive eight hours before morning 
but the Sound luminesces enough to gloss 
jabbed brushstrokes of cedar, the strand 

prickled with fringes of eelgrass, 
and the world's baby teeth ground down 
to this pall of sand.   

It's gusting so strong I can barely pee straight — 
You can see in each stunted and strung-out 
live oak the shape of the wind's hands. 

On this last stand before the Outer Banks 
Sharon makes camp while I pay twenty quarters 
to shelter stunned 

and out-of-context. Such bare slubs of land 
the memoir I'm reading calls griefscapes. 
The groove fits my tongue 

so for forty more pages I keep the light on, 
pulled by a man oaring 
his way through childhood to a stung 

and moondamp first place, all slap and vowel 
and grunt-pine punctuation, the no-way-satisfied   
lessing & moring 

of the tideshore. I knew in advance of reason 
this freight of rain, salt in my hair. 
That child I was, what was she mourning 

before death charged his first fare? 
We wake and hurry to slip our moorings. 
The ferry's there.

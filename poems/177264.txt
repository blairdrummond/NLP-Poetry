You can’t say it that way any more.   
Bothered about beauty you have to   
Come out into the open, into a clearing, 
And rest. Certainly whatever funny happens to you 
Is OK. To demand more than this would be strange 
Of you, you who have so many lovers,   
People who look up to you and are willing   
To do things for you, but you think 
It’s not right, that if they really knew you . . . 
So much for self-analysis. Now, 
About what to put in your poem-painting:   
Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.   
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,   
Skyrockets are good—do they still exist? 
There are a lot of other things of the same quality   
As those I’ve mentioned. Now one must 
Find a few important words, and a lot of low-keyed, 
Dull-sounding ones. She approached me 
About buying her desk. Suddenly the street was   
Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments.   
Humdrum testaments were scattered around. His head 
Locked into mine. We were a seesaw. Something   
Ought to be written about how this affects   
You when you write poetry: 
The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind 
Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate   
Something between breaths, if only for the sake   
Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you 
For other centers of communication, so that understanding 
May begin, and in doing so be undone.

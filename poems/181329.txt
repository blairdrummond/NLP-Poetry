I beat you with a hazel rod 
Come to me in madness 

I beat you with a bloodied rod 
Come like an angel 

I beat you with a rod from heaven 
Come to me like a wild boar 

*       *       * 

Ninety-nine serpents— 
ninety-nine flaming beasts— 
go to Ion 
Slip in by his shirt-collar 
squat in his heart 
scald him burn him   
turn his eyes to my eyes 
his face to my face 
his path to my house 
Make him see me in the distance 
a fine-feathered peacock   
make him pick me out as basil among weeds 
make him tease me among the girls 
Like following gold and silver 
fall in step with my words 
with my walk   
with my dance 

*       *       * 

Sweet boy 
don't send so much longing— 
send a little less 
and come with it yourself 

*       *       * 

Tuesday, basket full of black, 
how did you make me fall in love— 
did you clip my hair 
did you steal my footsteps? 
How did you charm me— 
with the hair of a mad wolf 
with three straws from the bed 
with splintered wood   
with the fairness of eyebrows 
with a chip off the gate 
with dark hair from a braid? 
How drive every other love away? 

*       *       * 

Eagle, eagle, grow into a flying bird 
Take yourself to Ion's house 
What you find in his head   
take in your head 
what you find in his ears   
take in your ears 
what you find in his mouth   
take in your mouth 
what you find in his hands   
take in your wings 
Take that great wrong away in your feathers— 

and what you find in your head   
put it in her head 
And what you find in your feathers   
put it on the table   
in their house

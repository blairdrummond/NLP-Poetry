I never hear the word "Escape" (144) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Living, Disappointment & Failure

Common Measure

I never hear the word "Escape" 
Without a quicker blood, 
A sudden expectation - 
A flying attitude! 

I never hear of prisons broad 
By soldiers battered down, 
But I tug childish at my bars 
Only to fail again!

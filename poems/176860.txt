title : Take, Oh Take Those Lips Away

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
Take, oh take those lips away, 
      That so sweetly were forsworne, 
And those eyes: the breake of day, 
      Lights that doe mislead the Morne; 
But my kisses bring againe, bring againe, 
Seales of love, but seal’d in vaine, seal’d in vaine.

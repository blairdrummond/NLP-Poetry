Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet tea. 
       Susie Asado. 
Susie Asado which is a told tray sure. 
A lean on the shoe this means slips slips hers. 
When the ancient light grey is clean it is yellow, it is a silver seller. 
This is a please this is a please there are the saids to jelly. These are the wets these say the sets to leave a crown to Incy. 
Incy is short for incubus. 
A pot. A pot is a beginning of a rare bit of trees. Trees tremble, the old vats are in bobbles, bobbles which shade and shove and render clean, render clean must.   
       Drink pups.   
Drink pups drink pups lease a sash hold, see it shine and a bobolink has pins. It shows a nail. 
What is a nail. A nail is unison. 
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet tea.

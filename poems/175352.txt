text : 
That hour-glass-backed, 
orchard-legged, 
heavy-headed will, 

paper-folded, 
wedge-contorted, 
savage—dense to kill— 

pulls back on backward-moving, 
arching 
high legs still, 

lowered through a deep, knees-reaching, 
feathered down 
green will, 

antenna-honest, 
thread-descending, 
carpeted as if with skill, 

a focus-changing, 
sober-reaching, 

tracing, killing will.

title : And I in My Bed Again

author : Hilda Morley

text : 
Last night
                     tossed in 
my bed
                     the sound of the rain turned me 
around,
                 a leaf 
in a dried gully
                            from side to 
side,
            the sound of the rain took me
apart,        opened to                 what is it?
breath caught in memory of 
a deep sweetness
                                     that sound
                                     unceasing
delicate,                the wetness running
through my body
                                    It might be nighttime 
                                    in a forest hut, 
the rain constant
                               in little rivulets 
splashing,
                          at times uncertain—
safe in each other's arms,
                                               the rain sheltering 
us       a depth opening 
bottomless to a terrible sweetness,
                                                    the small rain 
shaking us in our bed
                                              (the terror) 
whispering
                            End of a season, 
                            wind from the west

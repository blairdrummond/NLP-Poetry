text : 
I run high in my body 
on the road toward sea.

I fall in love. The things 
the wind is telling me.

The yellow sky quiet 
in her quiet dress.

Old birds sending news 
from the reddish hills.

& the one hawk flying 
in the distance overhead.

That hawk is what 
the wind says. In love

with the heaving 
of my peacock chest,

with my lungs, two wings, 
such flying things,

but mine for now, just for now 
as I open my stride

above the good, dirt road, 
fall in love with the mustard

& coriander dust, 
& the far, far mountain

beveled by light, by rain, 
the easy eye of the sun, now,

smoke floating across the hillside 
like a face I knew once very well.

Very well, I fall in love 
with the flowers & the wash

hung like prayer flags, see, 
in red Juanita's yard. In love 

with the earth the color of earth. In 
love with the goats, their bellies & hooves,

& the goat mouths bleating 
as they greet me on the road.

I fall in love. How they wear 
their strange & double-eyes.

How they do not blink 
or laugh at me

or say a thing I understand 
when I ask them in my English,

because they circle around my feet, 
as if they always knew me,

Were you my children once? 
Did I know your names?

Oh, little magics? 
Little children?

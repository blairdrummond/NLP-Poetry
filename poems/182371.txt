title : The Last Laugh

author : Wilfred Owen

text : 
‘O Jesus Christ! I’m hit,’ he said; and died.  
Whether he vainly cursed, or prayed indeed, 
 The Bullets chirped—In vain! vain! vain!  
Machine-guns chuckled,—Tut-tut! Tut-tut!  
And the Big Gun guffawed. 

Another sighed,—‘O Mother, mother! Dad!’ 
 Then smiled, at nothing, childlike, being dead.  
          And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud  
          Leisurely gestured,—Fool!             
          And the falling splinters tittered. 

‘My Love!’ one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,  
Till, slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.  
          And the Bayonets’ long teeth grinned; 
           Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned; 
           And the Gas hissed.

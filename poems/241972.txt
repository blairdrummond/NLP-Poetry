 One hundred breaths split the air
 as I lean
 on the only pine tree I find.
 It’s early or late, it’s breezy or hot.
 The fields are dry. Summer is near.
 The horses are everywhere, 
 strangely galloping a dream,
 but I can’t remember
 how to call them,
 so I stand back, watch them pass.

 The first time I rode a horse
 my body found the music of fire,
 crackling the wind. An unbearable pleasure
 that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.
 A sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing.
 A need to return—to belong.
 After all, departure is like
 pushing the weight of our heart
 against the village
 whose name has kept us awake.

 Rafael came from somewhere in Eurasia.
 I passed my hands through his mane—
 saw a history of conquests and battles,
 a field of hay, a mount of truth,
 heard a silent ring,
 his eyes asking me to go with him,
 to confess something sacred,
 to name something lustful.
 Nothing of where he came from, 
 or who I was, disturbed us.

 I knew he was different by the way he ran—
 without pause,
 without grace,
 without distraction,
 without ease.
 He was told how to move in the world
 and resented it.
 He knew he would never own anything.
  
  
 —
  
 He came toward me.
 It was a quiet afternoon.
 I stood unmoving.
 And we listened to the untitled music
 circling the earth like an anthem
 free of its nation.

 He was unfamiliar to me, 
 approaching as if he possessed the land.
 Every morning he stopped five feet
 from the river.

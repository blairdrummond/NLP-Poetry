Poems for Weddings



Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs
   Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell
   Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well
   Would passion arm me for the enterprise;
   But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;
   No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
   I am no happy shepherd of the dell
   Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes.
   Yet must I dote upon thee--call thee sweet,
   Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses
   When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication.
   Ah! I will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,
   And when the moon her pallid face discloses,
   I'll gather some by spells, and incantation.

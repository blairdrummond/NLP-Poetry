In the dark we disappear, pure being. 
 Our mirror images, impure being. 

 Being and becoming (Heidegger), being and 
 nothingness (Sartre)—which is purer being? 

 Being alone is no way to be: thus 
 loneliness is the test of pure being. 

 Nights in love I fell too far or not quite 
 far enough—one pure, one impure being. 

 Clouds, snow, mist, the dragon's breath on water, 
 smoke from fire—a metaphor's pure being. 

 Stillness and more stillness and the light locked 
 deep inside—both pure and impure being. 

 Is is the verb of being, I the noun— 
 or pronoun for the purists of being. 

 I was, I am, I looked within and saw 
 nothing very clearly: purest being.

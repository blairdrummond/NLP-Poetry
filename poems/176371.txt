text : 
I made a sand castle. 
In rolled the sea. 
            "All sand castles 
            belong to me— 
            to me," 
said the sea. 

I dug sand tunnels. 
In flowed the sea. 
            "All sand tunnels 
            belong to me— 
            to me," 
said the sea. 

I saw my sand pail floating free. 
I ran and snatched it from the sea. 
            "My sand pail 
            belongs to me— 
            to ME!"

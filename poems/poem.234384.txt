The Mock Song 
John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester 
1647-1680
17th Century
England
Love, Desire



I swive as well as others do, 
I'm young, not yet deformed, 
My tender heart, sincere, and true, 
Deserves not to be scorned. 

Why Phyllis then, why will you swive, 
With forty lovers more? 
Can I (said she) with Nature strive, 
Alas I am, alas I am a whore. 

Were all my body larded o'er, 
With darts of love, so thick, 
That you might find in ev'ry pore, 
A well stuck standing prick; 

Whilst yet my eyes alone were free, 
My heart, would never doubt, 
In am'rous rage, and ecstasy, 
To wish those eyes, to wish those eyes fucked out.

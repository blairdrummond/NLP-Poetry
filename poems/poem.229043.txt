Rhymed Stanza, Refrain

Forget not yet the tried intent 
Of such a truth as I have meant; 
My great travail so gladly spent, 
            Forget not yet. 

   Forget not yet when first began 
The weary life ye know, since whan 
The suit, the service, none tell can; 
            Forget not yet. 

   Forget not yet the great assays, 
The cruel wrong, the scornful ways; 
The painful patience in denays, 
            Forget not yet. 

   Forget not yet, forget not this, 
How long ago hath been and is 
The mind that never meant amiss; 
            Forget not yet. 

   Forget not then thine own approved, 
The which so long hath thee so loved, 
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved; 
            Forget not this.

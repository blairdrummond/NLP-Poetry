Home from town 
 the two of them sit 
 looking over what they have bought 
 spread out on the kitchen table 
 like gifts to themselves. 
 She holds a card of buttons 
 against the new dress material 
 and asks if they match. 
 The hay is dry enough to rake, 
 but he watches her 
 empty the grocery bag. 
 He reads the label 
 on a grape jelly glass 
 and tries on 
 the new straw hat again.

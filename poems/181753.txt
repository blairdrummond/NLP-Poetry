text : 
My heart was suspect.   
Wired to an EKG,   
I walked a treadmill   
that measured my ebb   
and flow, tracked isotopes   
that ploughed my veins,   
looked for a constancy   
I’ve hardly ever found.   
For a month I worried   
as I climbed the stairs   
to my office.  The mortality   
I never believed in   
was here now.  They   
say my heart’s ok,   
just high cholesterol, but   
I know my heart’s a house   
someone has broken into,   
a room you come back    
to and know some stranger    
with bad intent has been there   
and touched all that you love.  You know   
he can come back.  It’s his call,   
his house now.

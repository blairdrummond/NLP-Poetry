title : Damp Rot

author : John Engels

text : 
Water sheets on the old stone of the cellar walls, 
trickles out over the floor into little deltas of mud, 
worse every year, so that now I can see daylight 
at the footings, and upstairs the floors sometimes 
tremble and the clothes go damp in the closets. And sometimes   
I think the whole place is about to come down, and have begun 

to dream at night of moving, unaccountably sad 
to think of leaving this house which has possessed me now   
for eighteen years, in which one of us has died 
and two been born, for all its elegance of detail most everything   
not right in it, or long gone bad, nothing 
ever done which should have been, one hundred years   
and more of water rancid in the cellars, moldings 
never finished or else mitred crookedly, all 

the small and growing energies of dirt and rot   
wherever we care to look, whenever we do. And we do.   
But I dream also of the pine grove of my planting,   
which I know I love and which is the green truth   
of this place: in one day ten years ago 
I dug fourteen small trees, wrapped the roots 
in burlap, dragged them down from the top ridge   
of the hill, spaced them carefully, watered   
them each day for one whole season. Now 

they are twenty feet high, thick roots   
already at the cellar wall, vigorous and loud   
even in little winds, only the hemlock   
mournful and reluctant to do much in the way   
of increasing itself. But it is clear   
that if I do not freely leave this place, 
it will leave me—though, as Ray Reynolds says,   
digging at a powdery floor joist with his knife,   
there may be more here than I think, better   
than a two-by-six at least; and his blade slides   
two inches in and stops at what he calls 
the heartwood, meaning, as I take it, at the wood   
which has not yet given way.

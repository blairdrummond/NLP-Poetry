author : Joanna Fuhrman

text : 
You were never a man 
in the television sense of the word. 

I was never a wild Slinky 
in the sex-club sense of a toy. 

You were never a tobacco store 
in the Modernist sense of a trope. 

I was never a snowdrop 
in the candy store sense of a treat. 

You were never Day-glo 
in the fashionista sense of a scarf. 

I was never withyouallthetime 
in the username sense of a self. 

You were never a strumpet 
in the toothache sense of an insult. 

I was never a tooting horn 
in the childhood sense of a game. 

You were never a hole-in-my-heart   
in the country singer sense of a vista. 

I was never a paper doll 
in the pyromaniac sense of a pal. 

You were never a parenthesis 
in the phony secret sense of a sign. 

I was never red lipstick 
in the pulp novel sense of a threat. 

You were never a word 
in the mystic sense of an obstacle. 

I was never a shaking castanet   
in the midnight sense of a song.

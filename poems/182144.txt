The climate thinks with its knees. 
When the wound opens, music suspires. 
Opening a gate, I gain the color 
below the roof tiles and the tree limbs. 

You gave me 
the late quartets 
a black bird and 
a white and the 
Garden of Eden. 
Your death belongs 
to anyone but me. 

I wonder so as not to forget. At night in Brooklyn, the tendrils 
of a white sex denuded the sky, shimmering at the tall needle- 
ends of buildings. The traffic was identical in the spring. 

I am protected by only 
music I cannot remember. 
Why is it that the best 
minds ended by composing 
fairy tales? Death swarms. 
There are many new beings, 
the odor of hearts. The order 

of the hour of mating ends. These are many 
new butterflies, and death is no longer to 
be eyed by a young girl, perhaps twelve years 
old, slyly, as though the future were a manâ€™s 
sleeve or stride. I wonder so as not to end 
dinner in a farmhouse. We sat at a low table. 
Our host was dying but unaware, as she would 
be murdered the next day in a distant city. There is an out- 
side of language that is not silence. There is an outside of 
God that is not isolation, a domestic animal teaching a dying 
woman to hunt. A wound opens. A gate opens. Tendrils climb.

Southward with fleet of ice 
Sailed the corsair Death; 
Wild and gast blew the blast, 
And the east-wind was his breath. 

His lordly ships of ice 
Glisten in the sun; 
On each side, like pennons wide, 
Flashing crystal streamlets run. 

His sails of white sea-mist 
Dripped with silver rain; 
But where he passed there were cast 
Leaden shadows o'er the main. 

Eastward from Campobello 
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed; 
Three days or more seaward he bore, 
Then, alas! the land-wind failed. 

Alas! the land-wind failed, 
And ice-cold grew the night; 
And nevermore, on sea or shore, 
Should Sir Humphrey see the light. 

He sat upon the deck, 
The Book was in his hand; 
"Do not fear! Heaven is as near," 
He said, "by water as by land!" 

In the first watch of the night, 
Without a signal's sound, 
Out of the sea, mysteriously, 
The fleet of Death rose all around. 

The moon and the evening star 
Were hanging in the shrouds; 
Every mast, as it passed, 
Seemed to rake the passing clouds. 

They grappled with their prize, 
At midnight black and cold! 
As of a rock was the shock; 
Heavily the ground-swell rolled. 

Southward through day and dark, 
They drift in cold embrace, 
With mist and rain, o'er the open main; 
Yet there seems no change of place. 

Southward, forever southward, 
They drift through dark and day; 
And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream 
Sinking, vanish all away.

title : Scavenging the Wall

author : R. T. Smith

When fall brought the graders to Atlas Road, 
I drove through gray dust thick as a battle 
and saw the ditch freshly scattered with   gravel. 

Leveling, shaving on the bevel, the blade 
and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers— 
limestone loaves and blue slate, skulls of quartz 

not even early freeze had roused. Some rocks 
were large as buckets, others just a scone 
tumbled up and into light the first time 

in ages. Loose, sharp, they were a hazard 
to anyone passing. So I gathered 
what I could, scooped them into the bed 

and trucked my freight away under birdsong 
in my own life's autumn. I was eager 
to add to the snaggled wall bordering 

my single acre, to be safe, to be still 
and watch the planet's purposeful turning 
behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones. 

Uprooted, scarred, weather-gray of bones, 
I love their old smell, the familiar unknown. 
To be sure this time I know where I belong 

I have brought, at last, the vagrant road home.

title : Soweto

author : Kamau Brathwaite

text : 
Out of this roar of innumerable demons 

hot cinema tarzan sweat 
rolling moth ball eyes yellow teeth   
cries of claws slashes clanks 

a faint high pallor 

dust 

oceans rolling over the dry sand of the savanna 

your houses homes warm still with the buffalo milk   
bladder of elephant . tusk of his stripped tree   
sing soft clinks 

but the barracks 

the dark dark barks of the shark   
boys 
the cool juice of soweto . . . 


out of this dust they are coming 
our eyes listen out of rhinoceros thunder   
darkness of lion 

the whale roar stomping in heaven 
that black bellied night of hell and helleluia 
when all the lights of anger flicker flicker flicker flicker 

and we know somewhere there there is real fire 
basuto mokhethi namibia azania shaka the zulu kenyatta the shatt   
erer the maasai wandering into the everlasting shadow of jah 

daughters lost daughters 

bellowing against bullhorn and kleghorn 
bellowing against bargwart and the searchlights of dogs   
bellowing against crick and the kick in the stomach 

the acrid wretch against the teeth 
bellowing against malan malan malam malan 
and boer and boerwreck and boertrek and truckloads of metal 

helmet and fusil and the hand grenade 
and acid rhodes and the diamonds of oppenheimer   
the opulence of voortresshers the grass streiders . . . 


suddenly like that fire the crows in johannesburg   
you were there 
torn. in tears. tatters 

but the eyes glittered and the fist 
clenching around that scream of your mother bled   
into a black head of hammers 

and the night fell howl   
on soweto 

the night fell howl   
on soweto 

and we who had failed to listen all. those. foot. steps   
who had given you up like a torn paper package 

your heroes       burning in your houses   
                        rising from your dust bowls   
                        flaring from the sky 

                        listen now as the news items lengthen   
                        gathering like hawks looking upward like the   
                        leopard plunging into the turmoil like the 

                        constrictor 

and that crouch/shot 
shout out against that beast and pistol 
the police who shot patrice who castrated kimathi 

                        and clattering clattering clattering clattering   
                        the veldts gun metals wings 
                        rise from their last supper their hunger of bones 

                        bomba 

and the daniels sing 

                        ukufa akuqheleki kodwa ke   
                        kuthiwa akuhlanga lungehlanga   
                        lalani ngenxeba nikhuzeka 

                        and we are rowing out to sea where the woman   
                        lived with her pipe and her smoke   
                        shack 

                        and her tea in the tea   
                        pot 
                        tankard of hopes 

                        herbs 

                        lamagora afele   
                        izwe lawo 

                        and we are rowing out to sea   
                        where there are farms 

                        and our farmers laid waste the land 
                        to make honey. we are the bells of the land . . .

and that hill now under the ocean 
and the pages splashed with his blood   
and that bullet a hero a hero herero . . . 



once the germans destroyed every sperm   
in your village every man who could walk 
every nim growing into the noom and nam of yr man/hood 

they stripped skin and made catapults skulls were their pelmets   
upon the wall 
and the torn feet cracked and stacked and streggaed 

rubbish heap . dog howl . cenotaph 

and for days there was stench over the grasslands   
and for months there was silence upon the trees   
cow . goat . udder . manyatta 

bantustan upon the land . . . 

and then it was gone like all hero hero herero   
like your canoe upon the land . . . 


walking back down now from the shores of kikuyu water   
washing back down now from Swahili laughter 

zimbabwe kinshasa limpopo 
always limpopo the limper the healer 

it comes down from the ruins of the north   
from the lakes of the luo 

from the sunlights and sunrise of the east 

as antient as sheba as wise as the pharaohs   
as holy as the early morning mists of ityopia

title : In Lent

text : 
Dead deer a week now by the snowy gate.
Do I have to watch it be eaten? Do I have to see
who comes first, who quarrels, who stays?

And there is the question of the night, 
what flesh preferred by which creature— 
what sinew and fat, the organs, the eyes. 
These appetites: it’s enough 
to know the swoop and cut of wings 
over the snarl of something leaping away.

Do I have to see the icy figure fused to the ground, 
scrabbled snow, not lovely or deep, 
but the surface of something spoiled? 
By now the rib bones arch above it all, 
unbroken light shining between them, 
above the black cavity.

And I hear the crows, complaint, complaint 
splitting the morning, hunched over the skull. 
They know their offices.

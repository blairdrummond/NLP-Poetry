This dry night, nothing unusual   
About the clip, clop, casual 

Iron of his shoes as he stamps death 
Like a mint on the innocent coinage of earth. 

I lift the window, watch the ambling feather 
Of hock and fetlock, loosed from its daily tether 

In the tinker camp on the Enniskerry Road,   
Pass, his breath hissing, his snuffling head 

Down. He is gone. No great harm is done.   
Only a leaf of our laurel hedge is torn— 

Of distant interest like a maimed limb,   
Only a rose which now will never climb 

The stone of our house, expendable, a mere   
Line of defence against him, a volunteer 

You might say, only a crocus, its bulbous head   
Blown from growth, one of the screamless dead. 

But we, we are safe, our unformed fear 
Of fierce commitment gone; why should we care 

If a rose, a hedge, a crocus are uprooted   
Like corpses, remote, crushed, mutilated? 

He stumbles on like a rumour of war, huge   
Threatening. Neighbours use the subterfuge 

Of curtains. He stumbles down our short street   
Thankfully passing us. I pause, wait, 

Then to breathe relief lean on the sill   
And for a second only my blood is still 

With atavism. That rose he smashed frays   
Ribboned across our hedge, recalling days 

Of burned countryside, illicit braid: 
A cause ruined before, a world betrayed.

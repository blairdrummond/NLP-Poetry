title : The Accompanist

author : Dick Allen

text : 
I’ve always worried about you—the man or woman   
at the piano bench,   
night after night receiving only such applause   
as the singer allows: a warm hand please,   
for my accompanist.   At concerts,   
as I watch your fingers on the keys,   
and how swiftly, how excellently   
you turn sheet music pages,   
track the singer’s notes, cover the singer’s flaws,   
I worry about whole lifetimes,   
most lifetimes   
lived in the shadows of reflected fame;   
but then the singer’s voice dies   
and there are just your last piano notes,   
not resentful at all,   
carrying us to the end, into those heartfelt cheers   
that spring up in little patches from a thrilled audience   
like sudden wildflowers bobbing in a rain   
of steady clapping.   And I’m on my feet, also,   
clapping and cheering for the singer, yes,   
but, I think, partially likewise for you   
half-turned toward us, balanced on your black bench,   
modest, utterly well-rehearsed,   
still playing the part you’ve made yours.

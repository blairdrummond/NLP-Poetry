Returning, We Hear the Larks

Sombre the night is: 
 And, though we have our lives, we know 
 What sinister threat lurks there. 
  
 Dragging these anguished limbs, we only know 
 This poison-blasted track opens on our camp-- 
 On a little safe sleep. 
  
 But hark! Joy--joy--strange joy. 
 Lo! Heights of night ringing with unseen larks: 
 Music showering on our upturned listening faces. 
  
 Death could drop from the dark 
 As easily as song-- 
 But song only dropped, 
 Like a blind man's dreams on the sand 
 By dangerous tides;
 Like a girl's dark hair, for she dreams no ruin lies there, 
 Or her kisses where a serpent hides.

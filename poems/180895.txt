title : The Vain Advice

author : Catherine Cockburn

text : 
    Ah, gaze not on those eyes! forbear
    That soft enchanting voice to hear:
Not looks of basilisks give surer death,
Nor Syrens sing with more destructive breath.

    Fly, if thy freedom thou’dst maintain,
    Alas! I feel th’advice is vain!
A heart, whose safety but in flight does lie,
Is too far lost to have the power to fly.

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers (124) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Death, Living, Time & Brevity

Rhymed Stanza

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers -
Untouched by Morning - 
and untouched by noon -
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection, 
Rafter of Satin and Roof of Stone - 

Grand go the Years, 
In the Crescent above them -
Worlds scoop their Arcs - 
and Firmaments - row -
Diadems - drop - 
And Doges surrender -
Soundless as Dots, 
On a Disk of Snow.

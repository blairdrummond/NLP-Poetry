title : I Went into the Maverick Bar

I went into the Maverick Bar   
In Farmington, New Mexico. 
And drank double shots of bourbon 
                         backed with beer. 
My long hair was tucked up under a cap 
I’d left the earring in the car. 

Two cowboys did horseplay 
                         by the pool tables, 
A waitress asked us 
                         where are you from? 
a country-and-western band began to play   
“We don’t smoke Marijuana in Muskokie”   
And with the next song, 
                         a couple began to dance. 

They held each other like in High School dances   
                         in the fifties; 
I recalled when I worked in the woods 
                         and the bars of Madras, Oregon.   
That short-haired joy and roughness— 
                         America—your stupidity.   
I could almost love you again. 

We left—onto the freeway shoulders— 
                         under the tough old stars— 
In the shadow of bluffs 
                         I came back to myself, 
To the real work, to 
                         “What is to be done.”

Amy, Amy, at this distance you’re
 the smell of liver,
 tinnitus that keeps me up, afraid:
 your fortressness must now be tested.
 The way you took me in without
 a surfeit click or
  
 gesture: seagull kerchief
 binding my gut to safety
 on the swimming haul
 among night-images.       I went to the place I was born
 and it plainly was a bride. So I ran after her.
  
 When she turned into a star I swallowed her.
 And out of this uneasiness will come
 an aster.
  
 Amy, I’m inside my granddad’s mind of wood:
 the grass is finer, constellations thicker.
 The plums are normal. How
  
 much sugar did you buy
 alone at Waldbaums?
 Brook reeds here
  
 wake from your hair’s soul’s chilly patronage.
 The hair’s the soul, the reeds
 its body—alone in their beds
  
 like schoolgirls:
 I feel and feel them up.
 The cigarettes
 have made them crazy! But a rabbit someone 
 flows out of the embankment
  
 and I shiver for you, Amy
 oh lengthy dappled wig:
 there’s a swan in your breathing.
  
 There always is.

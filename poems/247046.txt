title : Rhymes for a Watertower

author : Christian Wiman

text : 
A town so flat a grave's a hill, 
            A dusk the color of beer.
 A row of schooldesks shadows fill, 
            A row of houses near.

 A courthouse spreading to its lawn, 
            A bank clock's lingering heat.
 A gleam of storefronts not quite gone, 
            A courthouse in the street.

 A different element, almost, 
            A dry creek brimming black.
 A fight to lure the darkness close, 
            A light to keep it back.

 A time so still a heart's a sound, 
            A moon the color of skin.
 A pumpjack bowing to the ground, 
            Again, again, again.

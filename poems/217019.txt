title : The Key to the Kingdom

author : Philip Gross

text : 
It's not exile, homes and families behind 
us, where we meet. It happens anywhere, 
               now: a stateless 
state of no name, quietly seceding 
from the crumbling empires round us, 

without stamps or Eurovision entries. 
No-one does it with a rough guide in a week. 
               You inhabit it 
or nothing. Like this: in a pavement cafe 
you blink and you seem to surprise them, 

the crowd, all its separate faces at once, 
coming out of solution like crystals, 
               like a rush of starlings 
or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning 
now and dents your cappuccino froth 

with a crisp little sound. And that's it: 
between breaths, just between you and me 
               as if; yes, 
QED. You are received. This is 
the freedom of the city, and the key 

to the kingdom, and its borders ripple 
outwards like a frill of breaking wave 
               onto flat sand, 
a wavering line already fading leaving 
spume-flecks high and dry, 

a prickling on your palm; you're five 
years old, looking up at the whole sea, 
               unsure: 
                            will you laugh or cry?

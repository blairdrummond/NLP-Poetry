Morn on her rosy couch awoke, 
   Enchantment led the hour, 
And mirth and music drank the dews 
   That freshen'd Beauty's flower, 
Then from her bower of deep delight, 
   I heard a young girl sing, 
'Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.' 

The Sun in noon-day heat rose high, 
   And on the heaving breast, 
I saw a weary pilgrim toil 
   Unpitied and unblest, 
Yet still in trembling measures flow'd 
   Forth from a broken string, 
'Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.' 

'Twas night, and Death the curtains drew, 
   'Mid agony severe, 
While there a willing spirit went 
   Home to a glorious sphere, 
Yet still it sigh'd, even when was spread
   The waiting Angel's wing, 
'Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.'

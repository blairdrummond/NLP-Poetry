title : Fabrication of Ancestors

For old Billy Dugan, shot in the ass in the Civil war, my father said.
The old wound in my ass
 has opened up again, but I 
 am past the prodigies
 of youth’s campaigns, and weep
 where I used to laugh
 in war’s red humors, half
 in love with silly-assed pains
 and half not feeling them.
 I have to sit up with
 an indoor unsittable itch
 before I go down late
 and weeping to the storm-
 cellar on a dirty night
 and go to bed with the worms.
 So pull dirt up over me
 and make a family joke
 for Old Billy Blue Balls,
 the oldest private in the world
 with two ass-holes and no
 place more to go to for a laugh
 except the last one. Say:
 The North won the Civil War
 without much help from me
 although I wear a proof
 of the war’s obscenity.

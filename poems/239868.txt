title : Multiplying Ground Zero

author : Linh Dinh

text : 
Ground zero refers to the detonation point
Of a bomb of any size, from one strapped
To the waist, to the Fat Man, to the Massive
Ordinance Air Burst. Like the Daisy Cutter,
The M.O.A.B. explodes just above the ashen clay
To insure that it spreads its sentiment sideways.

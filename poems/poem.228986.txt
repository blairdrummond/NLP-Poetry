Sonnet


Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,
With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned?
Albeit labouring for a scanty band
Of white-robed Scholars only?this immense
And glorious Work of fine intelligence!
Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore
Of nicely-calculated less or more;
So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof
Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,
Where light and shade repose, where music dwells
Lingering?and wandering on as loth to die;
Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
That they were born for immortality.

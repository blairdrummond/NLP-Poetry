title : Land's End

author : Robert Winner

text : 
Surviving in its fragile skin,
a white egret rises
from the gulf of its strength.
I want the lightest needle of a pine
to fall on my hand,
a pine with ravaged limbs.

I'd stare through salt-blind eyes 
at a remote fragile sea.   I'd roar. 
I'd make the skeleton of grief. 
I'd roar like you, unreconciled sea.

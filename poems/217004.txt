title : What Became

author : Wesley McNair

text : 
What became of the dear   
strands of hair pressed   
against the perspiration   
of your lover's brow   
after lovemaking as you gazed   
into the world of those eyes,   
now only yours?   

What became of any afternoon   
that was so vivid you forgot   
the present was up to its old   
trick of pretending   
it would be there   
always?   

What became of the one   
who believed so deeply   
in this moment he memorized   
everything in it and left   
it for you?

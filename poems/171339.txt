title : To Certain Critics

author : Countee Cullen

text : 
Then call me traitor if you must,   
Shout treason and default! 
Say I betray a sacred trust 
Aching beyond this vault. 
I’ll bear your censure as your praise,   
For never shall the clan 
Confine my singing to its ways 
Beyond the ways of man. 

No racial option narrows grief, 
Pain is no patriot, 
And sorrow plaits her dismal leaf   
For all as lief as not. 
With blind sheep groping every hill,   
Searching an oriflamme, 
How shall the shepherd heart then thrill   
To only the darker lamb?

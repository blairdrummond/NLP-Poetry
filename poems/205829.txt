title : The Correspondence-School Instructor Says Goodbye to His Poetry Students

author : Galway Kinnell

text : 
Goodbye, lady in Bangor, who sent me   
snapshots of yourself, after definitely hinting   
you were beautiful; goodbye, 
Miami Beach urologist, who enclosed plain   
brown envelopes for the return of your very 
“Clinical Sonnets”; goodbye, manufacturer   
of brassieres on the Coast, whose eclogues 
give the fullest treatment in literature yet 
to the sagging breast motif; goodbye, you in San Quentin,   
who wrote, “Being German my hero is Hitler,”   
instead of “Sincerely yours,” at the end of long,   
neat-scripted letters extolling the Pre-Raphaelites: 

I swear to you, it was just my way   
of cheering myself up, as I licked 
the stamped, self-addressed envelopes,   
the game I had of trying to guess   
which one of you, this time,   
had poisoned his glue. I did care.   
I did read each poem entire.   
I did say everything I thought   
in the mildest words I knew. And now, 
in this poem, or chopped prose, no better,   
I realize, than those troubled lines   
I kept sending back to you, 
I have to say I am relieved it is over: 
at the end I could feel only pity 
for that urge toward more life 
your poems kept smothering in words, the smell   
of which, days later, tingled in your nostrils   
as new, God-given impulses 
to write. 

Goodbye, 
you who are, for me, the postmarks again 
of imaginary towns—Xenia, Burnt Cabins, Hornell— 
their solitude given away in poems, only their loneliness kept.

                                  I

Queer are the ways of a man I know: 
             He comes and stands 
             In a careworn craze, 
             And looks at the sands 
             And the seaward haze 
             With moveless hands 
             And face and gaze, 
             Then turns to go... 
And what does he see when he gazes so? 

                                  II

They say he sees as an instant thing 
             More clear than to-day, 
             A sweet soft scene 
             That once was in play 
             By that briny green; 
             Yes, notes alway 
             Warm, real, and keen, 
             What his back years bring—
A phantom of his own figuring. 

                                  III

Of this vision of his they might say more: 
             Not only there 
             Does he see this sight, 
             But everywhere 
             In his brain–day, night, 
             As if on the air 
             It were drawn rose bright– 
             Yea, far from that shore 
Does he carry this vision of heretofore: 

                                  IV

A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried, 
             He withers daily, 
             Time touches her not, 
             But she still rides gaily 
             In his rapt thought 
             On that shagged and shaly 
             Atlantic spot, 
             And as when first eyed 
Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.

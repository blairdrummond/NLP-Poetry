title : The Map of the World Confused with Its Territory

author : Susan Stewart

text : 
In a drawer I found a map of the world, 
folded into eighths and then once again
and each country bore the wrong name because 
the map of the world is an orphanage.

The edges of the earth had a margin
as frayed as the hem of the falling night
and a crease moved down toward the center of 
the earth, halving the identical stars.

Every river ran with its thin blue
brother out from the heart of a country:
there cedars twisted toward the southern sky 
and reeds plumed eastward like an augur’s pens.

No dates on the wrinkles of that broad face,
no slow grinding of mountains and sand, for—
all at once, like a knife on a whetstone—
the map of the world spoke in snakes and tongues.

The hard-topped roads of the western suburbs 
and the distant lights of the capitol
each pull away from the yellowed beaches 
and step into the lost sea of daybreak.

The map of the world is a canvas turning 
away from the painter’s ink-stained hands 
while the pigments cake in their little glass 
jars and the brushes grow stiff with forgetting.

There is no model, shy and half-undressed, 
no open window and flickering lamp, 
yet someone has left this sealed blue letter, 
this gypsy’s bandana on the darkening

Table, each corner held down by a conch 
shell. What does the body remember at 
dusk? That the palms of the hands are a map 
of the world, erased and drawn again and

Again, then covered with rivers and earth.

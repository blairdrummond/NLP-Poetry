title : Gin

There’s a mystery 
By the river, in one of the cabins 
Shuttered with planks, its lock 
Twisted; a bunch of magazines flipped open,   
A body. A blanket stuffed with leaves 
Or lengths of rope, an empty gin bottle.   
Put down your newspaper. Look out 
Beyond the bluffs, a coal barge is passing,   
Its deck nearly 
Level with the water, where it comes back riding   
High. You start talking about nothing,   
Or that famous party, where you went dressed   
As a river. They listen, 
The man beside you touching his odd face   
In the countertop, the woman stirring tonic   
In your glass. Down the bar the talk’s divorce,   
The docks, the nets 
Filling with branches and sour fish. Listen, 
I knew a woman who’d poke a hole in an egg, suck   
It clean and fill the shell with gin, 
Then walk around all day disgusting people   
Until she was so drunk 
The globe of gin broke in her hand. She’d stay   
Alone at night on the boat, come back 
Looking for another egg. That appeals to you, rocking   
For hours carving at a hollow stone. Or finding   
A trail by accident, walking the bluff’s 
Face. You know, your friends complain. They say   
You give up only the vaguest news, and give a bakery 
As your phone. Even your stories 
Have no point, just lots of detail: The room 
Was long and bright, small and close, angering Gaston;   
They turned away to embrace him; She wore   
The color out of season, 
She wore hardly anything at all; Nobody died; Saturday.   
These disguises of omission. Like forgetting 
To say obtuse when you talk about the sun, leaving   
Off the buttons as you’re sewing up the coat. So,   
People take the little 
They know to make a marvelous stew; 
Sometimes, it even resembles you. It’s not so much   
You cover your tracks, as that they bloom 
In such false directions. This way friends who awaken   
At night, beside you, awaken alone.

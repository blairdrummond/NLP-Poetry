Symbolist

The feverish room and that white bed, 
The tumbled skirts upon a chair,   
The novel flung half-open, where 
Hat, hair-pins, puffs, and paints are spread; 

The mirror that has sucked your face 
Into its secret deep of deeps, 
And there mysteriously keeps 
Forgotten memories of grace; 

And you half dressed and half awake, 
Your slant eyes strangely watching me, 
And I, who watch you drowsily, 
With eyes that, having slept not, ache; 

This (need one dread? nay, dare one hope?) 
Will rise, a ghost of memory, if 
Ever again my handkerchief 
Is scented with White Heliotrope.

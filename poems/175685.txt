title : November Cotton Flower

author : Jean Toomer

text : 
Boll-weevil’s coming, and the winter’s cold, 
Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old, 
And cotton, scarce as any southern snow, 
Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow, 
Failed in its function as the autumn rake; 
Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take 
All water from the streams; dead birds were found 
In wells a hundred feet below the ground— 
Such was the season when the flower bloomed. 
Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed 
Significance. Superstition saw 
Something it had never seen before: 
Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear, 
Beauty so sudden for that time of year.

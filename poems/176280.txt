text : 
Coleridge carefully wrote down a whole page   
of them, all beginning with the letter b.   
Guidebooks preserve our knowledge 
of their hues and shapes, their breeding. 
Many poems have made delicate word-chimes— 
like wind-chimes not for wind but for the breath of man— 
out of their lovely names. 
At the edge of the prairie in a cabin 
when thunder comes closer to thump the roof hard   
a few of them—in a corner, brittle in a dry jar   
where a woman’s thoughtful hand left them to fade— 
seem to blow with the announcing winds outside   
as the rain begins to fall on all their supple kin 
of all colors, under a sky of one color, or none.

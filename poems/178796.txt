title : Amaryllis

text : 
A flower needs to be this size 
to conceal the winter window, 
and this color, the red 
of a Fiat with the top down, 
to impress us, dull as we've grown. 

Months ago the gigantic onion of a bulb 
half above the soil 
stuck out its green tongue 
and slowly, day by day, 
the flower itself entered our world, 

closed, like hands that captured a moth, 
then open, as eyes open, 
and the amaryllis, seeing us, 
was somehow undiscouraged. 
It stands before us now 

as we eat our soup; 
you pour a little of your drinking water 
into its saucer, and a few crumbs 
of fragrant earth fall 
onto the tabletop.

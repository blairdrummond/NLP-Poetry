We speak of the pain of childbirth, referring, 
of course, to the mother, but what is pain 
to the mother, the one through whose body 
the course unwinds? She understands already 
what kind of world she must return to, 
how it daily hones its many edges 
against human skin, unlike the child whose 
untried limbs inch toward it, pressing now 
so firmly against her he feels for the first time 
the pinch of bone against bone and is seared 
by the friction. Isn't he the one 
on whom the real burden falls, the one 
to whom resilience means nothing yet? His 
tender skin like a small measure of cloth 
unfolding before the blade under which 
he will, for a lifetime, bruise 
and heal: Crush of the long descent, grip 
of the steadying hands, brush of breath 
against cheek, even the constant barrage 
of the microscopic, the tiny plink-plink 
of the dust motes knocking against him 
before custom makes him numb to it. No wonder 
the startled mouth cries out, 
each pore suddenly hungry 
in the withering, nourishing light.

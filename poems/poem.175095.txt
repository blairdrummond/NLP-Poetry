Rhymed Stanza

God prosper long our noble Queen, 
       And long may she reign! 
Maclean he tried to shoot her, 
       But it was all in vain. 

For God He turned the ball aside 
       Maclean aimed at her head; 
And he felt very angry 
       Because he didn't shoot her dead. 

There's a divinity that hedges a king, 
       And so it does seem, 
And my opinion is, it has hedged 
       Our most gracious Queen. 

Maclean must be a madman, 
       Which is obvious to be seen, 
Or else he wouldn't have tried to shoot 
       Our most beloved Queen. 

Victoria is a good Queen, 
       Which all her subjects know, 
And for that God has protected her 
       From all her deadly foes. 

She is noble and generous, 
       Her subjects must confess; 
There hasn't been her equal 
       Since the days of good Queen Bess. 

Long may she be spared to roam 
       Among the bonnie Highland floral, 
And spend many a happy day 
       In the palace of Balmoral. 

Because she is very kind 
       To the old women there, 
And allows them bread, tea, and sugar, 
       And each one to get a share. 

And when they know of her coming, 
       Their hearts feel overjoy'd, 
Because, in general, she finds work 
       For men that's unemploy'd. 

And she also gives the gipsies money 
       While at Balmoral, I've been told, 
And, mind ye, seldom silver, 
       But very often gold. 

I hope God will protect her 
       By night and by day, 
At home and abroad, 
       When she's far away. 

May He be as a hedge around her, 
       As He's been all along, 
And let her live and die in peace 
       Is the end of my song.

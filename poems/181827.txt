title : Evening Angelus

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
I have forgotten the words, 
and therefore I shall not conceive 
of a mysterious salvation, I shall 
not become a tall lily and bloom 
into blue and white. Then what 
oracular event shall appear on 
my doorstep? What announcement 
shall crowd me to a corner, 
protesting an unworthiness, 
which doubtless shall be believed? 

But these are only bells we hear, 
pulled down by the arms of the 
drunken janitor, two fingers missing 
on his left hand. And we have 
climbed into that tower, its spiraling 
wooden staircase creaking beneath our 
feet. We have seen for ourselves 
that it is only iron that rings, iron 
swinging on an iron bar, the rough rope 
threading down to the cold ground, 
no death or holiness in 
those hollow shells.

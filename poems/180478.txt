title : The Intruder

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
after Jean Follain
In the evenings they listen to the same 
tunes nobody could call happy 
somebody turns up at the edge of town 
the roses bloom 
and an old dinner bell rings once more 
under the thunder clouds 
In front of the porch posts of the store 
a man seated on a soda water case 
turns around and spits and says 
to everybody 
in his new set of clothes 
holding up his hands 
as long as I live nobody 
touches my dogs my friends

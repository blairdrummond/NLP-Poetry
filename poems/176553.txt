We’re having a Halloween party at school. 
I’m dressed up like Dracula. Man, I look cool! 
I dyed my hair black, and I cut off my bangs. 
I’m wearing a cape and some fake plastic fangs. 

I put on some makeup to paint my face white, 
like creatures that only come out in the night. 
My fingernails, too, are all pointed and red. 
I look like I’m recently back from the dead. 

My mom drops me off, and I run into school 
and suddenly feel like the world’s biggest fool. 
The other kids stare like I’m some kind of freak— 
the Halloween party is not till next week.

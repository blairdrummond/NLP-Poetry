In Memory of Dennis Turner, 1946-1984
A hook shot kisses the rim and 
hangs there, helplessly, but doesn’t drop, 

and for once our gangly starting center   
boxes out his man and times his jump 

perfectly, gathering the orange leather   
from the air like a cherished possession 

and spinning around to throw a strike   
to the outlet who is already shoveling 

an underhand pass toward the other guard   
scissoring past a flat-footed defender 

who looks stunned and nailed to the floor   
in the wrong direction, trying to catch sight 

of a high, gliding dribble and a man   
letting the play develop in front of him 

in slow motion, almost exactly 
like a coach’s drawing on the blackboard, 

both forwards racing down the court 
the way that forwards should, fanning out 

and filling the lanes in tandem, moving   
together as brothers passing the ball 

between them without a dribble, without   
a single bounce hitting the hardwood 

until the guard finally lunges out   
and commits to the wrong man 

while the power-forward explodes past them   
in a fury, taking the ball into the air 

by himself now and laying it gently   
against the glass for a lay-up, 

but losing his balance in the process,   
inexplicably falling, hitting the floor 

with a wild, headlong motion 
for the game he loved like a country 

and swiveling back to see an orange blur   
floating perfectly through the net.

title : The Sleep of the Tuba-Player

author : Ana Božičević

text : 
The tuba wakes before the man. It’s a content animal:
 having no word, for the moment, suits it fine.
  
 It looks at him with a dun and smooth
 interiority, as a glass of rum might,
  
 or a worn number on an apartment building:
 his hands, crossed on the chest, rise and fall with breathing.
  
 In the dream, he’s ringing the bell now; climbing,
 unlocking the door, peering into a glass.
  
 The flat is empty. Is the war over yet? Or
 was he here before the war? Soon, dropping salt levels
  
 will wake him—
  
 in tears, with an odd groove in his palm, as though
 he’d held on to an instrument for hours.
  
 For a good minute, he’ll be nameless, and when
 a name does come, it won’t be his:
  
 humming in thought the bright last name
 he rang on the doorbell, he’ll see, in a certain
  
 abrupt sunlight: he’d chosen
 her, then—
 to be able to call everything something.

A night address
The world is wasted on you. Show us one clear time 
beyond childhood (or the bottle) you spent your whole 
self—hoarding no blood-bank back-up, some future aim 
to fuel—or let yourself look foolish in reckless style 
on barstool, backstreet or dancefloor, without a dim 
image of your hamming hobbling you the whole while. 
Voyeur to your own couplings, you never did come 
with them, did you, even when you did? You said Hell 
is details, when Hell was just the cave, the concave- 
mirrored skull you dwelt inside, your left hand 
polishing while the other shook to clinch a deal— 
Provide, provide! Sure, in the end, like any soul 
you were endless and yets—brave, deft with phrases, kind— 
three cheers for you. Too closed to want what others love 
you vetoed life— 
                                                 were there other worlds to crave?

title : On Pickiness

author : Rodney Jones

text : 
When the first mechanical picker had stripped the field, 
It left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness 
That my mother could not console herself to the waste 
And insisted on having it picked over with human hands, 

Though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets 
And the hands had long since gone into the factories. 
No matter how often my father pointed this out, 
She worried it the way I’ve worried the extra words 

In poems that I conceived with the approximate 
Notion that each stanza should have the same number 
Of lines and each line the same number of syllables— 
And disregarded it, telling myself a ripple 

Or botch on the surface, like the stutter of a speaker, 
Is all I have to affirm the deep fluency below. 
The Hebrews distrusted Greek poetry (which embodied 
Harmony and symmetry, and, therefore, revision) 

Not for aesthetic reasons, but because they believed 
That to change the first words, which rose unsmelted 
From the trance, amounted to sacrilege against God. 
In countries where, because of the gross abundance 

Of labor, it’s unlawful to import harvesting machines, 
I see the women in the fields and think of how, 
When my mother used to pick, you could tell 
Her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage 

That tumbled from her sack so pristinely white 
And devoid of burrs, it seemed to have already 
Passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin. 
Dr. Williams said of Eliot that his poems were so 

Cautiously wrought that they seemed to come 
To us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow. 
What my father loved about my mother was not 
Just the beauty of her body and face, but the practice 

Of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands 
As they made the house that abides in us still 
As worry and bother, but also the perfect freedom beyond— 
As cleanliness is next to godliness but is not God.

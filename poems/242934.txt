Adrift in the middle of my years, I sit in a corner and drink. I eavesdrop
a tableful of girls romancing their cell phones, workshopping
love’s abstract particulars,
                                               while football plays on the big screen;
I listen like a thief in case the women know the score.
But I never could tell. At fulltime I walk home like a motherless child.

Witness is a solitary game. There isn’t a thing I have left to say
but back in my room I ring like a singing bowl,
empty and unable to stop.
                                               You’re in nine kinds of pain, my friend; you know
the twenty-seven strains of despair. And your lovely hair has fallen.
The moon at my window is a rusted shot, caught in its corrupt trajectory down.

The world was always someone else’s oyster, a metaphor
I never could prise open. 
All I’m good for tonight
                                             is to let the night pass,
while beyond me the world peters and my friend fights beautifully
like a trout on god’s line. The usual idiots are still in power. But they’ll keep.

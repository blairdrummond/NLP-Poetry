Rhymed Stanza

To love these books, and harmless tea,
   Has always been my foible,
Yet will I ne'er forgetful be
   To read my Psalms and Bible.

Travels I like, and history too,
   Or entertaining fiction;
Novels and plays I'd have a few,
   If sense and proper diction.

I love a natural harmless song,
   But I cannot sing like Handel;
Deprived of such resource, the tongue
   Is sure employed -- in scandal.

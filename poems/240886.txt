I. Separation Precedes Meeting

 The cat so close
 to the fire
 I smell scorched 
 breath. Parents,
 silent, behind me,
 a feeling of
 trees that might fall.
 Or dogs. 
                  A poem,
 like trying
 to remember,
 is a movement
 of the whole body.
 You follow the 
 fog
 into more fog.
 Maybe the door ahead
 divides
 the facts
 from natural affection. How
 can I know. I meet
 too many
 in every mirror.

 When I was little,
 was I I?
 My sister? A wolf
 chained,
 smothered in green virtues? 
                                               Slower
 time
 of memory. Once
 I’ve got something
 I lie
 down on it
 with my whole body.
 Goethe quotations, warm
 sand, a smell of hay,
 long afternoons.
                             But it
 would take a road
 would turn, with space,
 in on itself,
 would turn
 occasion into offer.

 For days I hold
 a tiny landscape between
 thumb
 and index:
 sand,
 heather,
 shimmer of blue between pines.
 No smell: matchbook.
 Sand as schematic as
                                     Falling
 into memory,
 down,
 with my blood,
 to the accretions
 in the arteries,
 to be read with the whole
 body, in the chambers
 of the heart.
 The light: of the match,
 struck,
 at last.
  
  
 
  
  
    
 4.
  
 Concentration: a frown
 of the whole body. I can’t
 remember. Too many
 pasts
 recede
 in all directions.
 Slow movement into 
                                    Distant boots.
 Black beetles at night. A smell
 of sweat.
                  The restaurant,
 yes. You’ve no idea
 how much my father used to eat.
 Place thick with smoke.
 Cards. Beer foaming over
 on the table.
                      And always
 some guy said I ought
 to get married,
 put a pillow behind my eyes
 and, with a knowing
 sigh, spat
 in my lap.
  
  
 
  
  
  
 5.
  
 The present.
 As difficult as
 the past, once a place
 curves into
            Hips swinging elsewhere.
 Castles in sand.
 Or Spain. Space
 of another language.
                                    Sleep
 is a body of water.
 You follow your lips
 into its softness. Far down
 the head finds its level
    
  
  
  

  
  
 6. Tropisms
  
 Inward, always. Night
 curls the clover leaf
 around its sleep.
 Tightly.
 The bodies of the just
 roll,
 all night,
 through subterranean caves
 which turn 
 in on themselves.
                                 Long
 tunnel
 of forgetting. Need
 of blur. The air,
 large, curves
 its whole body.
 Big hammering waves
 flatten my 
 muscles.
 Inward, the distances: male
 and female fields,
 rigorously equal.
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
 7.
  
 The drunk fell toward me
 in the street. I hope
 he wasn’t
 disappointed. Skinned
 his sleep.
                  November.
  
 And a smell of snow. Quite normal,
 says the landlord, the master
 of rubbish, smaller
 and smaller in my 
 curved mirror.
                          I have un-
 controllable
 good luck: my sleep
 always turns dense
 and visible. There
 are many witches
 in Germany. Their songs
 descend in steady half-tones
 through you.
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
 8.
  
 You’ll die, Novalis says, you’ll die
 following endless rows
 of sheep into your
 even breath.
                      Precarious,
 like Mozart, a living
 kind of air,
 keeps the dream
 spinning
 around itself, its
 missing core.
 Image
 after image of pleasure
 of the whole body
 deepens 
my sleep:
  
 fins. 
  
  
  

  
  
  
    
 9. Introducing Decimals
  
 A dream, like trying 
 to remember, breaks open words
 for other,
 hidden meanings. The grass
 pales by degrees, twigs
 quaver glassily,
 ice
 flowers the window.
 Intimate equations more complicated
 than the coordinates of past
 and Germany. The cat
 can’t lift its paw,
 its leg longer and longer
 with effort.
 A crying fit 
 is cancelled. An aria jelled
 in the larynx.
 Nothing moves in the cotton
 coma: only Descartes
 pinches himself
 an every fraction 
 must be solved.

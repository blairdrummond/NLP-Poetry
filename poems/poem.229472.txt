Epic

from Book I, Introduction 

Man's Reason is in such deep insolvency to sense, 
that tho' she guide his highest flight heav'nward, and teach him 
dignity morals manners and human comfort, 
she can delicatly and dangerously bedizen 
the rioting joys that fringe the sad pathways of Hell. 
Not without alliance of the animal senses 
hath she any miracle: Lov'st thou in the blithe hour 
of April dawns--nay marvelest thou not--to hear 
the ravishing music that the small birdes make 
in garden or woodland, rapturously heralding 
the break of day; when the first lark on high hath warn'd 
the vigilant robin already of the sun's approach, 
and he on slender pipe calleth the nesting tribes 
to awake and fill and thrill their myriad-warbling throats 
praising life's God, untill the blisful revel grow 
in wild profusion unfeign'd to such a hymn as man 
hath never in temple or grove pour'd to the Lord of heav'n? 
      Hast thou then thought that all this ravishing music, 
that stirreth so thy heart, making thee dream of things 
illimitable unsearchable and of heavenly import, 
is but a light disturbance of the atoms of air, 
whose jostling ripples, gather'd within the ear, are tuned 
to resonant scale, and thence by the enthron'd mind received 
on the spiral stairway of her audience chamber 
as heralds of high spiritual significance? 
and that without thine ear, sound would hav no report. 
Nature hav no music; nor would ther be for thee 
any better melody in the April woods at dawn 
than what an old stone-deaf labourer, lying awake 
o'night in his comfortless attic, might perchance 
be aware of, when the rats run amok in his thatch? 
      Now since the thoughtless birds not only act and enjoy 
this music, but to their offspring teach it with care, 
handing on those small folk-songs from father to son 
in such faithful tradition that they are familiar 
unchanging to the changeful generations of men-- 
and year by year, listening to himself the nightingale 
as amorous of his art as of his brooding mate 
practiseth every phrase of his espousal lay, 
and still provoketh envy of the lesser songsters 
with the same notes that woke poetic eloquence 
alike in Sophocles and the sick heart of Keats-- 
see then how deeply seated is the urgence whereto 
Bach and Mozart obey'd, or those other minstrels 
who pioneer'd for us on the marches of heav'n 
and paid no heed to wars that swept the world around, 
nor in their homes wer more troubled by cannon-roar 
than late the small birds wer, that nested and carol'd 
upon the devastated battlefields of France. 
      Birds are of all animals the nearest to men 
for that they take delight in both music and dance, 
and gracefully schooling leisure to enliven life 
wer the earlier artists: moreover in their airy flight 
(which in its swiftness symboleth man's soaring thought) 
they hav no rival but man, and easily surpass 
in their free voyaging his most desperate daring, 
altho' he hath fed and sped his ocean-ships with fire; 
and now, disturbing me as I write, I hear on high 
his roaring airplanes, and idly raising my head 
see them there; like a migratory flock of birds 
that rustle southward from the cold fall of the year 
in order'd phalanx--so the thin-rankt squadrons ply, 
til sound and sight failing me they are lost in the clouds. 

       ..... 

Time eateth away at many an old delusion, 
yet with civilization delusions make head; 
the thicket of the people wil take furtiv fire 
from irresponsible catchwords of live ideas, 
      sudden as a gorse-bush from the smouldering end 
of any loiterer's match-splint, which, unless trodden out 
afore it spredd, or quell'd with wieldy threshing-rods 
wil burn ten years of planting with all last year's ricks 
and blacken a countryside. 'Tis like enough that men 
ignorant of fire and poison should be precondemn'd 
to sudden deaths and burnings, but 'tis mightily 
to the reproach of Reason that she cannot save 
nor guide the herd; that minds who else wer fit to rule 
must win to power by flattery and pretence, and so 
by spiritual dishonesty in their flurried reign 
confirm the disrepute of all authority-- 
but only in sackcloth can the Muse speak of such things. 

       from Book II. Selfhood 

The Spartan General Brasidas, the strenuous man, 
who earn'd historic favour from his conquer'd foe, 
once caught a mouse foraging in his messbasket 
among the figs, but when it bit him let it go, 
praising its show of fight in words that Plutarch judged 
worth treasuring; and since I redd the story at school 
unto this hour I hav never thought of Brasidas 
and cannot hear his name, but that I straightway see 
a table and an arm'd man smiling with hand outstretch'd 
above a little mouse that is scampering away. 
      Why should this thing so hold me? and why do I welcome now 
the tiny beast, that hath come running up to me 
as if here in my cantos he had spied a crevice, 
and counting on my friendship would make it his home? 
      'Tis such a pictur as must by mere beauty of fitness 
convince natural feeling with added comfort. 
The soldier seeth the instinct of Selfhood in the mouse 
to be the same impulse that maketh virtue in him. 
For Brasidas held that courage ennobleth man, 
and from unworth redeemeth, and that folk who shrink 
from ventur of battle in self-defence are thereby doom'd 
to slavery and extinction: and so this mouse, albeit 
its little teeth had done him a petty hurt, deserved 
liberty for its courage, and found grace in man. 

       ..... 

What is Beauty? saith my sufferings then.--I answer 
the lover and poet in my loose alexandrines: 
Beauty is the highest of all these occult influences, 
the quality of appearances that thru' the sense 
wakeneth spiritual emotion in the mind of man: 
And Art, as it createth new forms of beauty, 
awakeneth new ideas that advance the spirit 
in the life of Reason to the wisdom of God. 
But highest Art must be as rare as nativ faculty is 
and her surprise of magic winneth favor of men 
more than her inspiration: most are led away 
by fairseeming pretences, which being wrought for gain 
pursue the ephemeral fashion that assureth it; 
and their thin influences are of the same low grade 
as the unaccomplish'd forms; their poverty is exposed 
when they would stake their charm on ethic excellence; 
for then weak simulations of virtues appear, 
such as convention approveth, but not Virtue itself, 
tho' not void of all good: and (as I read) 'twas this 
that Benvenuto intended, saying that not only 
Virtue was memorable but things so truly done 
that they wer like to Virtue; and thus prefaced his book, 
thinking to justify both himself and his works. 
      The authority of Reason therefor relieth at last 
hereon--that her discernment of spiritual things, 
the ideas of Beauty, is her conscience of instinct 
upgrown in her (as she unto conscience of all 
upgrew from lower to higher) to conscience of Beauty 
judging itself by its own beauteous judgment. 

       from Book III. Breed 

How was November's melancholy endear'd to me 
in the effigy of plowteams following and recrossing 
patiently the desolat landscape from dawn to dusk, 
as the slow-creeping ripple of their single furrow 
submerged the sodden litter of summer's festival! 
They are fled, those gracious teams; high on the headland now 
squatted, a roaring engin toweth to itself 
a beam of bolted shares, that glideth to and fro 
combing the stubbled glebe: and agriculture here, 
blotting out with such daub so rich a pictur of grace, 
hath lost as much of beauty as it hath saved in toil. 
      Again where reapers, bending to the ripen'd corn, 
were wont to scythe in rank and step with measured stroke, 
a shark-tooth'd chariot rampeth biting a broad way, 
and, jerking its high swindging arms around in the air, 
swoopeth the swath. Yet this queer Pterodactyl is well, 
that in the sinister torpor of the blazing day 
clicketeth in heartless mockery of swoon and sweat, 
as 'twer the salamandrine voice of all parch'd things: 
and the dry grasshopper wondering knoweth his God. 

       from Book IV, Ethick 

Beauty, the eternal Spouse of the Wisdom of God 
and Angel of his Presence thru' all creation, 
fashioning her new love-realm in the mind of man, 
attempteth every mortal child with influences 
of her divine supremacy ... ev'n as in a plant 
when the sap mounteth secretly and its wintry stalk 
breaketh out in the prolific miracle of Spring, 
or as the red blood floodeth into a beating heart 
to build the animal body comely and strong; so she 
in her transcendant rivalry would flush his spirit 
with pleasurable ichor of heaven: and where she hath found 
responsiv faculty in some richly favour'd soul-- 
L'anima vaga delle cose belle, as saith 
the Florentine,--she wil inaugurate her feast 
of dedication, and even in thatt earliest onset, 
when yet infant Desire hath neither goal nor clue 
to fix the dream, ev'n then, altho' it graspeth nought 
and passeth in its airy vision away, and dieth 
out of remembrance, 'tis in its earnest of life 
and dawn of bliss purer and hath less of earthly tinge 
than any other after-attainment of the understanding: 
for all man's knowledge kenneth also of toil and flaw 
and even his noblest works, tho' they illume the dark 
with individual consummation, are cast upon 
by the irrelevant black shadows of time and fate. 

       ..... 

Repudiation of pleasur is a reason'd folly 
of imperfection. Ther is no motiv can rebate 
or decompose the intrinsic joy of activ life, 
whereon all function whatsoever in man is based. 
Consider how this mortal sensibility 
hath a wide jurisdiction of range in all degrees, 
from mountainous gravity to imperceptible 
faintest tenuities:--The imponderable fragrance 
of my window-jasmin, that from her starry cup 
of red-stemm'd ivory invadeth my being, 
as she floateth it forth, and wantoning unabash'd 
asserteth her idea in the omnipotent blaze 
of the tormented sun-ball, checquering the grey wall 
with shadow-tracery of her shapely fronds; this frail 
unique spice of perfumery, in which she holdeth 
monopoly by royal licence of Nature, 
is but one of a thousand angelic species, 
original beauties that win conscience in man: 
a like marvel hangeth o'er the rosebed, and where 
the honeysuckle escapeth in serpentine sprays 
from its dark-cloister'd clamber thru' the old holly-bush, 
spreading its joybunches to finger at the sky 
in revel above rivalry. Legion is their name; 
Lily-of-the-vale, Violet, Verbena, Mignonette, 
Hyacinth, Heliotrope, Sweet-briar, Pinks and Peas, 
Lilac and Wallflower, or such white and purple blooms 
that sleep i' the sun, and their heavy perfumes withhold 
to mingle their heart's incense with the wonder-dreams, 
love-laden prayers and reveries that steal forth from earth, 
under the dome of night: and tho' these blossomy breaths, 
that hav presumed the title of their gay genitors, 
enter but singly into our neighboring sense, that hath 
no panorama, yet the mind's eye is not blind 
unto their multitudinous presences:--I know 
that if odour wer visible as color is, I'd see 
the summer garden aureoled in rainbow clouds, 
with such warfare of hues as a painter might choose 
to show his sunset sky or a forest aflame; 
while o'er the country-side the wide clover-pastures 
and the beanfields of June would wear a mantle, thick 
as when in late October, at the drooping of day 
the dark grey mist arising blotteth out the land 
with ghostly shroud. Now these and such-like influences 
of tender specialty must not--so fine they be-- 
fall in neglect and all their loveliness be lost, 
being to the soul deep springs of happiness, and full 
of lovingkindness to the natural man, who is apt 
kindly to judge of good by comfortable effect. 
Thus all men ever hav judged the wholesomness of food 
from the comfort of body ensuing thereupon, 
whereby all animals retrieve their proper diet; 
but if when in discomfort 'tis for pleasant hope 
of health restored we swallow nauseous medicines, 
so mystics use asceticism, yea, and no man 
readier than they to assert eventual happiness 
to justify their conduct. Whence it is not strange 
(for so scientific minds in search of truth digest 
assimilable hypotheses) they should extend 
their pragmatism, and from their happiness deduce 
the very existence and the natur of God, and take 
religious consolation for the ground of faith: 
as if the pleasur of life wer the sign-manual 
of Nature when she set her hand to her covenant. 
      But man, vain of his Reason and thinking more to assure 
its independence, wil disclaim complicity 
with human emotion; and regarding his Mother 
deemeth it dutiful and nobler in honesty 
coldly to criticize than purblindly to love; 
and in pride of this quarrel he hath been led in the end 
to make distinction of kind 'twixt Pleasur and Happiness; 
observing truly enough how one may hav pleasure 
and yet miss happiness; but this warpeth the sense 
and common use of speech, since all tongues in the world 
call children and silly folk happy and sometimes ev'n brutes. 
      The name of happiness is but a wider term 
for the unalloy'd conditions of the Pleasur of Life, 
attendant on all function, and not to be deny'd 
to th' soul, unless forsooth in our thought of nature 
spiritual is by definition unnatural.

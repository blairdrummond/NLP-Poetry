text : 
My mind is shuffling its deck tonight,   
slipping one card over another,   
letting them all fall together at the corners;   
the random hand of memory 
is dealing from the bottom of the pack. 

First: a bearded man emptying 
the dragon kiln, then a woman 
whistling, her face turned away   
as she opens the oven. Next:   
a big cat, six toes on each paw,   
climbing up the yardpole. Last:   
a pair of workhorses circling a tree 
until they grind themselves to dust. 

There is no one home in the world 
tonight. Everyone is out of range. 
The cradles are empty, the boughs 
broken down. Trees go helter-skelter 
and the wheel is creaking on its shaft. 
Hit me, I say to the dealer. Hit me again.

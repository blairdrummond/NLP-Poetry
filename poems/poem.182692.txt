'Oh! sister, he is so swift and tall, 
Though I want the ride, he will spoil it all, 
For, when he sets out, he will let me fall, 
   And give me a bump, I know! 
Mamma, what was it I heard you say, 
About the world's hobbies, the other day, 
How some would get on and gallop away,    
   To end with an overthrow?' 

'I said, little prattler, the world was a race, 
That many would mount with a smile on the face, 
And ride to their ruin, or fall in disgrace: 
   That him, who was deaf to fear, 
And did not look our for a rein or a guide, 
His courser might cast on the highway side, 
In the mud, rocks and brambles, to end his ride, 
   Perchance with a sight and a tear!' 

'Oh! sister, sister! I fear to try; 
For Brutus's back is so live and high! 
It creeps at my touch - and he winks his eye--   
   I'm sure he is going to jump! 
Come! dear mother, tell us some more 
About the world's ride, as you did before, 
Who helped it up - and all how it bore 
   The fall, and got over the bump!'

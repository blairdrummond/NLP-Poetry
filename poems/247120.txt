I guess it's too late to live on the farm

I guess it's too late to enter the darkened room in which a single light 
illuminated the artist stripped from the waist down, smeared with 
blood, stretched and bound to the table

I guess it's too late to inhabit a glass-fronted, white, box-like room, 
dressed in white, against which the menstrual blood was visible

I guess it's too late to start farming

I guess it's too late to start struggling to remain standing in a 
transparent plastic cubicle filled with wet clay, repeatedly slipping and 
falling

I guess it's too late to buy 60,000 acres in Marfa

I guess it's too late to begin appearing on the subway in stinking 
clothes during rush hour with balloons attached to her ears, nose, hair 
and teeth

I guess we'll never have an orgiastic Happening

I guess we're too old to carry out maintenance activities in public 
spaces, during public hours

I guess we couldn't afford to simulate masturbation while President 
Josip Broz Tito's motorcade drove by below

I guess we're not suited to "I am awake in the place where women die"

I guess we'll never have a self-inflicted wound in front of an audience now

I guess entering a sex cinema dressed in a black shirt, jeans with the 
crotch removed, and a machine gun slung over her shoulder is not in 
the cards now

I guess Clive wouldn't make a good photographic montage in which 
their male and female faces became almost indistinguishable

I guess I can't expect we'll ever have a selection of photographs derived 
from images produced by the beauty industry now

I guess I'll have to give up all my dreams of being seen, clothed and 
unclothed, being systematically measured by two male 'researchers' 
who record her measurements on a chart and compare them with a set 
of 'normal' measurements

I guess I'll never be waiting for my body to break down, to get ugly

We couldn't get tied together by our hair anyways though Allen 
Ginsberg got one late in life

Maybe someday I'll have the foreshortened barrel of a gun pointing 
toward the viewer

I guess joining our hands around the base's perimeter fence into which 
they weave strands of wool is really out

Feeding the pigs and the chickens, walking between miles of rows of crops

I guess examining women's working conditions is just too difficult

We'll never have a, never-really-a-collective, a group of women who 
came together to work on a public mural

Too much work and still to be poets

Who are the simultaneously-the-beneficiary-of-our-cultural-heritage-
and-a-victim-of-it-poets

Was there ever a poet who had a self-sufficient loss of certainty

Flannery O'Connor raised peacocks

And Wendell Berry has raised large-scale spirals of rusted industrial 
materials in incongruous natural and commercial spaces

Faulkner may have spent three days in a gallery with a coyote, a little

And Robert Frost asked a friend to shoot him at close range with a .22 
caliber rifle

And someone told me Samuel Beckett lay hidden under a gallery-wide 
ramp, masturbating while vocalizing into a loudspeaker his fantasies 
about the visitors walking above him

Very few poets are really going to the library carrying a concealed tape 
recording of loud belches

If William Carlos Williams could be a doctor and Charlie Vermont too, 
If Yves Klein could be an artist, and Jackson Pollock too,

Why not a poet who was also dying of lymphoma and making a series of 
life size photographs, self-portrait watercolors, medical object-sculptures 
and collages made with the hair she lost during chemotherapy

Of course there was Brook Farm
And Virgil raised bees
Perhaps some poets of the past were overseers of the meticulous
chronicle of the feeding and
                    excretory cycles of her son during the first six months of his life 
I guess poets tend to live more momentarily 
Than life in her body as the object of her own sculpting activity would allow 
You could never leave the structures made of wood, rope and concrete 
blocks assembled to form
                    stocks and racks, to give a reading 
Or to go to a lecture by Emerson in Concord 
I don't want to be continuously scrubbing the flesh off of cow bones 
with a cleaning brush but
                    my mother was right 
I should never have tried to rise out of the proletariat 
Unless I can convince myself as Satan argues with Eve 
That we are among a proletariat of poets of all the classes 
Each ill-paid and surviving on nothing 
Or on as little as one needs to survive 
Steadfast as any person's glottis, photographed with a laryngoscope, 
speaking the following
                    words: "The power of language continues to show its trace for 
a long time after silence"
                    and fixed as the stars 
Tenants of a vision we rent out endlessly

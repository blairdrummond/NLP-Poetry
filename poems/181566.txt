title : I Looked for Life and Did a Shadow See

author : James Galvin

text : 
Some little splinter 
Of shadow purls 
And weals down 
The slewed stone 
Chapel steps, 
Slinks along 
The riverrock wall 
And disappears 
Into the light. 
Now ropy, riffled, 
Now owlish, sere, 
It smolders back 
To sight beneath 
A dwarfish, brindled tree 
That chimes and sifts 
And resurrects 
In something’s sweet 
And lethal breath. 
This little shadow 
Seems to know 
(How can it know? 
How can it not?) 
Just when to flinch 
Just where to loop and sag 
And skitter down, 
Just what to squirrel 
And what to squander till 
The light it lacks 
Bleeds it back 
And finds 
My sleeping dark-haired girl — 
O personal, 
Impersonal, 
Continual thrall — 
And hammocks blue 
In the hollows of her eyes.

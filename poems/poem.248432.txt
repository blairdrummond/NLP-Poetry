Rhymed Stanza

O living pictures of the dead,
 O songs without a sound,
 O fellowship whose phantom tread
 Hallows a phantom ground--
 How in a gleam have these revealed
 The faith we had not found.
  
 We have sought God in a cloudy Heaven,
 We have passed by God on earth:
 His seven sins and his sorrows seven,
 His wayworn mood and mirth,
 Like a ragged cloak have hid from us
 The secret of his birth.
  
 Brother of men, when now I see
 The lads go forth in line,
 Thou knowest my heart is hungry in me
 As for thy bread and wine;
 Thou knowest my heart is bowed in me
 To take their death for mine.

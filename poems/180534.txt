text : 
It's midnight now and sounds like midnight then, 
The words like distant stars that faintly grace 
                     The all-pervading dark of space, 
                     But not meant for the world of men. 
                                        It's not what we forget 
But what was never known we most regret 
Discovery of. Checking one last cassette 
Among my old unlabelled discards, few 
Of which reward the playing, I find you. 

Some years after her death, but years ago, 
Hearing Gwen's voice recite "Suburban Sonnet," 
                     At first we could not focus on it, 
                     So jolted that the radio 
                                        Should casually exhume 
From our shared memory the woman whom 
We knew and make her present in the room, 
As though in flesh, surprised to find that she 
Had earned this further immortality. 

Who ever thought they would not hear the dead? 
Who ever thought that they could quarantine 
                     Those who are not, who once had been? 
                     At that old station on North Head 
                                        Inmates still tread the boards, 
Or something does; equipment there records 
The voices in the dormitories and wards, 
Although it's years abandoned. Undeleted, 
What happened is embedded and repeated, 

Or so they say. And that would not faze you 
Who always claimed events could not escape 
                     Their scenes, recorded as on tape 
                     In matter and played back anew 
                                        To anyone attuned 
To that stored energy, that psychic wound. 
You said you heard the presence which oppugned 
Your trespass on its lasting sole occasion 
In your lost house. I scarcely need persuasion, 

So simple is this case. Here in the dark 
I listen, tensing in distress, to each 
                     Uncertain fragment of your speech, 
                     Each desolate, half-drunk remark 
                                        You uttered unaware 
That this cassette was running and would share 
Far in the useless future your despair 
With one who can do nothing but avow 
You spoke from midnight, and it's midnight now.

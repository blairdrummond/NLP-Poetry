To Sir Henry Cary 
Ben Jonson 
1572-1637
Renaissance
England




That neither fame nor love might wanting be 
To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee; 
Whose house, if it no other honor had, 
In only thee might be both great and glad; 
Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time, 
Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime; 
Which deed I know not, whether were more high, 
Or thou more happy, it to justify 
Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day, 
Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray. 
Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won, 
To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run. 
Love honors, which of best example be 
When they cost dearest and are done most free; 
Though every fortitude deserves applause, 
It may be much or little in the cause. 
He's valiant'st that dares fight, and not for pay; 
That virtuous is, when the reward's away.

Metaphor

Imagine Lucifer 
An angel without angelness 
An apple 
Plucked clear by will of taste, color, 
Strength, beauty, roundness, seed 
Absent of all God painted, present everything 
An apple is. 
Imagine Lucifer 
An angel without angelness 
A poem 
That has revised itself out of sound 
Imagine, rhyme, concordance 
Absent of all God spoke of, present everything 
A poem is. 
                            The law I say, the Law 
Is? 
What is Lucifer 
An emperor with no clothes 
No skin, no flesh, no heart 
An emperor!

title : Being in Love

text : 
Awakened from a dream, I curl up
 and turn. The roses on the dresser
 smile and your words bloom.
 The red roses for Valentine’s Day. 

 Like in a film
 thoughts of you unfold
 moment by moment.
  
 I vaguely hear
 the sound of your spoon scooping cereal
 the water stream in the shower
 the buzzing noise of your electric razor
 like a singing of cicada.

 Your footsteps in and out of the bedroom.
 Your lips touching my cheek lightly.
 And the sound of the door shutting.

 In your light
 I fall asleep again under the warm quilt
 happily like a child.

 Upon waking
 on the kitchen counter I find a half
 grapefruit carefully cut and sectioned.
 Such a loving touch is a milestone
for my newly found happiness.

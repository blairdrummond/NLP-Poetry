title : Baby Wrens’ Voices

author : Thomas R. Smith

text : 
I am a student of wrens. 
When the mother bird returns 
to her brood, beak squirming 
with winged breakfast, a shrill 
clamor rises like jingling 
from tiny, high-pitched bells. 
Who’d have guessed such a small 
house contained so many voices? 
The sound they make is the pure sound 
of life’s hunger. Who hangs our house 
in the world’s branches, and listens 
when we sing from our hunger? 
Because I love best those songs 
that shake the house of the singer, 
I am a student of wrens.

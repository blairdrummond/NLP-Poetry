title : Hunting the Cotaco Creek

His hand in hold so trigger-tight its blood
 believes in ghosts. It clings with finger set
 on steel and waits inside a dream of ducks.
 The twilight burns into a rising arc
 of eastern sky as sun reveals herself
 too proud and instantly receives full-face
 a splash of mallard flock. A shotgun blasts
 the yellow into streaming pinks and gives
 the creek its new-day taste of echoed blood.
 Two green head ghosts fly through the pulse of dawn
 upon a trigger’﻿s touch. The creek empties
 of sound. In silence human fingers find
 wet feet of web and carry in each hand
 a bird whose only cry comes in color.

title : Spring

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
When daisies pied and violets blue 
   And lady-smocks all silver-white 
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue 
   Do paint the meadows with delight, 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 
                         Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: Oh word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear! 

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, 
   And merry larks are plowmen’s clocks, 
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, 
   And maidens bleach their summer smocks, 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 
                         Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: Oh word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear!

text : 
I have not ever seen my father’s grave. 

Not that his judgment eyes 
have been forgotten 
nor his great hands’ print 
on our evening doorknobs 
            one half turn each night 
            and he would come 
            drabbled with the world’s business   
            massive and silent 
            as the whole day’s wish   
            ready to redefine 
            each of our shapes 
but now the evening doorknobs   
wait    and do not recognize us   
as we pass. 

Each week a different woman   
regular as his one quick glass 
each evening 
pulls up the grass his stillness grows   
calling it weed. 
Each week    a different woman   
has my mother’s face 
and he 
who time has    changeless 
must be amazed 
who knew and loved 
but one. 

My father died in silence   
loving creation 
and well-defined response   
he lived    still judgments   
on familiar things 
and died    knowing 
a January 15th that year me. 

Lest I go into dust 
I have not ever seen my father’s grave.

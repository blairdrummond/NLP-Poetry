I refuse to settle 
out of the true 
choose to communicate 
through pay phones and paper
out here in the country of McAllister & Steiner
we are the only Victorians left
& I wish I wouldn’t have said 
that one something that one time
when what I really wanted
was to finish cutting the okra for the gumbo
& read Baudelaire again
his L’Invitation au Voyage 
backwards reveals all of the magic 
in writing that one can endure
each line out loud resounds perfect
all week I’ve been thinking about printing
a pirated book of such, nothing grand
typed on the Remington, 3x4, no address
no copyright and fifty limited
for whomever I run into

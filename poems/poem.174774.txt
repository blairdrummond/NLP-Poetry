Rhymed Stanza

         I cannot change, as others do,
         Though you unjustly scorn;
      Since that poor swain, that sighs for you
         For you alone was born.
      No, Phyllis, no, your heart to move
         A surer way I'll try:
      And to revenge my slighted love,
Will still love on, will still love on, and die.

         When, kill'd with grief, Amyntas lies;
         And you to mind shall call
      The sighs that now unpitied rise;
         The tears that vainly fall:
      That welcome hour that ends this smart,
         Will then begin your pain;
      For such a faithful, tender heart
Can never break, can never break in vain.

I did not have exactly a way of life
but the bee amazed me and the windâ€™s plenty 
was almost believable. Hearing a magpie laugh

through a ghost town in Wyoming, saying Hello 
in Cambridge, eating cheese by the frothy Rhine, 
leaning from plexiglass over Tokyo,

I was not able to make one life of all 
the presences I haunted. Still the bee 
amazed me, and I did not care to call

accounts from the wind. Once only, at Pompeii, 
I fell into a sleep I understood, 
and woke to find I had not lost my way.

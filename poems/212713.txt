title : Ice

In the warming house, children lace their skates,   
bending, choked, over their thick jackets. 

A Franklin stove keeps the place so cozy 
it’s hard to imagine why anyone would leave, 

clumping across the frozen beach to the river.   
December’s always the same at Ware’s Cove, 

the first sheer ice, black, then white 
and deep until the city sends trucks of men 

with wooden barriers to put up the boys’   
hockey rink. An hour of skating after school, 

of trying wobbly figure-8’s, an hour 
of distances moved backwards without falling, 

then—twilight, the warming house steamy   
with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs 

aching. Outside, the hockey players keep   
playing, slamming the round black puck 

until it’s dark, until supper. At night, 
a shy girl comes to the cove with her father. 

Although there isn’t music, they glide 
arm in arm onto the blurred surface together, 

braced like dancers. She thinks she’ll never 
be so happy, for who else will find her graceful, 

find her perfect, skate with her 
in circles outside the emptied rink forever?

 A pity the selfsame vehicle that spirits me away from 
 factories of tedium should likewise serve to drag
 me backwards into panic, or that panic should erect
  
 massive factories of its own, their virulent pollutants
 havocking loved waterways, frothing all the reed-
 fringed margins acid pink and gathering in the shell
  
 and soft tissues of the snails unknowingly in danger
 as they inch up stems. Through the bulkhead door
 I can hear their spirals plunk into the sluggish south-
  
 bound current and dissolve therein with such brutal
 regularity their dying has given rise to the custom
 of measuring time here in a unit known as the snailsdeath.
  
 The snailsdeath refers to the average length of time,
 about 43 seconds, elapsing between the loss of the first
 snail to toxic waters and the loss of the next, roughly
  
 equivalent to the pause between swallows in a human
 throat, while the adverb here refers to my person
 and all its outskirts, beginning on the so-called cellular
  
 level extending more of less undaunted all the way down
 to the vale at the foot of the bed. I often fear I’ll wake
 to find you waiting there and won’t know how to speak
  
 on the subject of my production, or rather my woeful
 lack thereof, but in your absence, once again, I will begin
 drafting apologies in a language ineffectual as doves.

 Daybreak on my marshland: a single egret, blotched,
 trudges through the froth. I take its photograph
 from the rooftop observation deck from which I watch
  
 day’s delivery trucks advance. I take advantage of
 the quiet before their arrival to organize my thoughts
 on the paranormal thusly: (1) If the human psyche 
  
 has proven spirited enough to produce such a range 
 of material effects upon what we’ll call the closed
 system of its custodial body, indeed if it’s expected to,
  
 and (2) If such effects might be thought to constitute
 the physical expression of that psyche, an emanation
 willed into matter in a manner not unlike a brand-
  
 new car or cream-filled cake or disposable camera,
 and (3) If the system of the body can be swapped out
 for another, maybe an abandoned factory or a vale,
  
 then might it not also prove possible for the psyche
 by aptitude or lather or sheer circumstance to impress
 its thumbprint on some other system, a production
  
 in the basement, or in a video store, as when I find you
 inching up steps or down a shady aisle or pathway,
 dragging your long chains behind you most morosely
  
 if you ask me, the question is: Did you choose this, or was it
 imposed on you, but even as I ask your hands move
 wildly about your throat to indicate you cannot speak.

 After the memory of the trucks withdrawing heavy
 with their cargo fans out and fades into late-morning
 hunger, I relocate in time to the lit bank of vending
  
 machines still humming in the staff-room corner for a light
 meal of cheese curls, orange soda, and what history
 will come to mourn as the last two cream-filled cakes.
  
 Eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently
 thinking of trying not to think, I imagine the Bethlehem
 steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the sky
  
 wide open without any question, steam and dioxides
 of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as I walk
 down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake
  
 again on the floor in embarrassment. If there’s any use
 of imagination more productive or time less painful
 it hasn’t tried hard enough to push through to find me
  
 wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as Earth
 approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy.
 Taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction
  
 visible from the observation deck. Hoping to capture
 what I can point to as the way it feels. Sensing my hand
 in what I push away. Watching it dissolve into plumes
  
 rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples,
 or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that
 surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it.

 (Plunk) Up from the floor with the sun to the sound of
 dawn’s first sacrifice to the residues of commerce.
 On autofog, on disbelief: rejuvenation in a boxer brief
  
 crashed three miles wide in the waves off Madagascar,
 cause of great flooding in the Bible and in Gilgamesh.
 Massive sphere of rock and ice, of all events in history
  
 (Plunk) thought to be the lethalmost. A snailsdeath
 semiquavers from pang to ghost where the habit of ghosts
 of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom
  
 tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements
 of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows
 not the dead’s ongoing interest in their old adversary
  
 (Plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard
 mechanical kind of being. An erotic lounging to reanimate
 the long-inert pendulum. As I have felt you banging
  
 nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel.
 This passion for the material realm after death however
 refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy
  
 (Plunk) it while alive. When the last of the human voices
 told me what I had to do, they rattled off a shopping
 list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats.
  
 That left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy
 albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern,
 yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless.

 Graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance
 makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic
 mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs,
  
 snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary
 canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . .
 There are rooms I won’t enter, at whose threshold I say
  
 this is as far as I go, no farther, almost as if I can sense
 there’s something in there I don’t want to see, or for which
 to see means having wanted already to forget, unless
  
 stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp,
 the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss
 of apartness from what you’d held unknown, meaning
  
 you don’t come to know it so much as become it, wholly
 warping into its absorbent fold. I can’t let that happen
 if it hasn’t already. What draws me on might be thought
  
 canine, keen-sighted, but it’s still incapable of divining why
 the constant hum around or inside me has to choose 
 among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call
  
 of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank
 on my gullible anatomy. Am I not beset in the utmost
 basement of industry? Is that basement itself not beset
  
 by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of Mesoamerica?
 And haven’t I parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me
 asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself?

 Asked again what I miss the most about my former life,
 I remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera
 an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities,
  
 I eliminate certain objects and events from the running
 right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure
 brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been
  
 light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods
 shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch
 their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes.
  
 Or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth
 with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats
 crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding
  
 plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere
 spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth,
 approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week.
  
 Or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it
 with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose,
 emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production,
  
 shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference
 could another make now. And so I clear my throat, look
 directly into the camera, and even though it will make me
  
 come off bovine in their eyes, I say that what I miss the most
 has to be those cream-filled cakes I used to like, but then
 they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn.

 After the panic grew more of less customary, the pity 
 dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility
 from the rooftop observation deck. Mobile in the sense
  
 that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually
 moved. Because it didn’t. It just stayed there, reducing 
 visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it
  
 or diminished it partly. Because it didn’t. It pretty much
 managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography
 will come to show: field after field of untouched white.
  
 After the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare,
 too embarrassing to be with, I eased into the knowledge
 that you’d never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale
  
 turned into a lifetime’s heap of laundry, and not the gentle
 tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only 
 imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greens
  
 and about which I predicted its monotony of fair weather
 over time might deaden one all over again, unless being
 changed with death means not only changing past change
  
 but past even the wish for it. I worried to aspire towards
 that condition might actually dull one’s aptitude for change.
 That I would grow to protect what I wished to keep from
  
 change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it.
 In this sense I had come to resemble the fogbank, at once
 given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph.
  
 The last time I saw myself alive, I drew the curtain back
 from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. I felt tenderness
 towards it. I knew how long it had waited, and how little
  
 time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods.
 When I tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth
 released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay.
  
 I wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from
 what I felt. I couldn’t quite manage it. Even at this late hour,
 even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world.

 The noises from the basement were not auspicious noises.
 I wanted to live forever. I wanted to live forever and die
 right then and there. I had heard the tight, distinctive shriek.
  
 Here again and now. I no longer have legs. I am sleeping.
 Long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide,
 water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide,
  
 and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room
 through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents
 with confidence. They are the spectral forms of anaconda.
  
 The ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. A certain brand.
 Hand-rolled. He smiles as if there is much to smile about.
 And there is. He is hollow-eyed, toothless. His hat, infamous:
  
 broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw.
 His cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive
 black and white chevrons. Otherwise, as here, the full pelt
  
 of a jaguar. On a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons
 he trudges through the froth. He is the lord of black sorcery
 and lord of percussion. He is patron of commerce. He parts
  
 the leaves of Mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken
 ax wielders, collection agents. His scribe is a white rabbit. 
 Daughter of moon and of night. Elsewhere, you are having
  
 your teeth taken out. There is no music left, but I still feel held 
 captive by the cinema, and in its custom, I believe myself
 capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my hands.

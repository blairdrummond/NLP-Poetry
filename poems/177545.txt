title : Laundry

author : Bruce Smith

Not even the cops who can do anything could do this
work on Sunday picking up dirty and delivering clean 
laundry in Philadelphia. Rambling with my father, get this, 
in a truck that wasn’t even our own,
part ambulance, part bullet, there wasn’t anything 
we couldn’t do. Sheets of stigmata, macula of love, 
vomit and shit and the stains of pissing
another week’s salary away, we picked up and drove 
to the stick men in shirt sleeves, the thin
Bolshevik Jews who laughed out the sheets like the empty 
speech in cartoons. They smelled better than sin, 
better than decadent capitalism. And oh, we
could deliver, couldn’t we, the lawless bags through the city 
that said in his yawn, get money, get money, get money.

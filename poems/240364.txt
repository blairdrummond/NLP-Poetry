title : I Leave Her Weeping

author : Liz Rosenberg

text : 
I leave her weeping in her barred little bed, 
 her warm hand clutching at my hand, 
 but she doesn’t want a kiss, or to hug the dog goodnight— 
 she keeps crying mommy, uhhh, mommy, 
 with her lovely crumpled face 
 like a golden piece of paper I am throwing away. 
 We have been playing for hours, 
 and now we need to stop, and she does not want 
 to. She is counting on me to lower the boom 
 that is her heavy body, and settle her down. 
 I rub her ribcage, I arrange the blankets around her hips. 
 Downstairs are lethal phonecalls I have to answer. 
 Friends 
 dying, I need to call. 
 My daughter may be weeping all my tears, 
 I only know 
 that even this young 
 and lying on her side, 
 her head uplifted like a cupped tulip, 
 sometimes she needs to cry.

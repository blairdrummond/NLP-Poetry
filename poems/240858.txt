title : Vietnam Epic Treatment

It doesn’t matter
 A damn what’s playing—
 In the dead of winter
 You go, days of 1978—
 79, and we went
 Because the soldiers were beautiful
 And doomed as Asian jungles
 Kept afire Christ-like
 In the hopeless war
 I did not go to in the end
 Because it ended.
  
 The 20th century?
 It was a war
 Between peasants on the one side,
 Hallucinations on the other.
 A peasant is a fire that burns
 But is not consumed.
 His movie never ends.
 It will be beautiful
 Every winter of our lives, my love,
 As Christ crushes fire into his wounds
 And the wounds are a jungle.
 Equally, no matter when their movies end,
 Hallucinations destroy the destroyers.
 That’s all.
 There has never been a President of the United States.
  
 And the 21st century?
 Hallucination vs. hallucination
 In cold battle, in dubious battle,
 No battle at all because the peasants
 Have gone away far
 Into the lost traveler’s dream,
 Into a passage from Homer,
 A woodcutter’s hillside
 Peacetime superstition movie. 
  
 On a cold night, Hector.
 On a cold night, Achilles.
 Around the savage and the maniac 
 The woodcutter draws a ring of fire.
 It burns all winter long.
 He never tires of it
 And for good reason:
 Every face of the flames is doomed and beautiful;
 Every spark that shoots out into the freezing air
 Is God’s truth
 Given us all over again
 In the bitter weather of men’s 
 Hallucinations. There has never been
 A President of the United States.
 There has never been a just war.
 There has never been any life
 Beyond this circle of firelight
 Until now if now is no dream but an Asia.

(dirt stolen from an infant’s grave around midnight)
Do not try to take it from my child’s grave, nor 
from the grave   
of my childhood, 
nor from any infant’s grave I guard—voodoo, juju, boo-hoo rites   
calling for it or not! This dust, this dirt, will not 
be taken at dawn or noon 
or at the dusky time,   
and if you approach 
this sacred place near midnight, 
then I will chop, 
one by one, your fingers off 
with which you do your harm. Goofer-dust: if you want it, 
if you need it, then 
erect downwind from a baby’s grave 
a fine-meshed net   
and gather it 
one-half grain, a flaky mote, an infinitesimally small fleck 
of a flake at a time   
and in such a way   
it is given to you 
by the day, the wind, the world, 
it is given to you, thereby 
diminishing the need to steal 
this dirt displaced by a child 
in a child’s grave.

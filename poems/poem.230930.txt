And, the Last Day Being Come, Man Stood Alone

Rhymed Stanza

And, the last day being come, Man stood alone 
Ere sunrise on the world's dismantled verge, 
Awaiting how from everywhere should urge 
The Coming of the Lord. And, behold, none 

Did come,--but indistinct from every realm 
Of earth and air and water, growing more 
And louder, shriller, heavier, a roar 
Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm 

His ears; and as he looked affrighted round 
Every manner of beast innumerable 
All thro' the shadows crying grew, until 
The wailing was like grass upon the ground. 

Asudden then within his human side 
Their anguish, since the goad he wielded first, 
And, since he gave them not to drink, their thirst, 
Darted compressed and vital.--As he died, 

Low in the East now lighting gorgeously 
He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed 
Which, with a spear transfixed, yet availed 
To pluck the sun down into the dead sea.

 FAT
 is the soul of this flesh.
 Eat with your hands, slow, you will understand
 breasts, why everyone
 adores them—Rubens’ great custard nudes—why
 we can’t help sleeping with
 pillows.
  
 The old woman in the park pointed,
 Is it yours?
 Her gold eye-teeth gleamed.
  
 I bend down, taste the fluted
 nipples, the elbows, the pads
 of the feet. Nibble earlobes, dip
 my tongue in the salt fold
 of shoulder and throat.
  
 Even now he is changing,
 as if I were 
 licking him thin.

 HE SQUEEZES his eyes tight
 to hide
 and blink! he’s still here.
 It’s always a surprise.
  
 Safety-fat,
 angel-fat,
  
 steal it in mouthfuls,
 store it away
 where you save
  
 the face that you touched
 for the last time
 over and over,
 your eyes closed
  
 so it wouldn’t go away.

 WATCH HIM sleeping. Touch
 the pulse where
 the bones haven’t locked
 in his damp hair:
 the navel of dreams.
 His eyes open for a moment, underwater.
  
 His arms drift in the dark
 as your breath
 washes over him.
  
 Bite one cheek. Again.
 It’s your own
 life you lean over, greedy,
 going back for more.

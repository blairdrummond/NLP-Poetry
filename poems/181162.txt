text : 
when your man comes home from prison, 
when he comes back like the wound 
and you are the stitch, 
when he comes back with pennies in his pocket 
and prayer fresh on his lips, 
you got to wash him down first. 

you got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled 
and calmed, waiting for his skin like a shining baptism 
back into what he was before gun barrels and bars 
chewed their claim in his hide and spit him 
stumbling backwards into screaming sunlight. 

you got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears 
from ashy skin, lather down the cuffmarks 
from ankle and wrist, rinse solitary’s stench loose 
from his hair, scrape curse and confession 
from the welted and the smooth, 
the hard and the soft, 
the furrowed and the lax. 

you got to hold tight that shadrach’s face 
between your palms, take crease and lid 
and lip and brow and rinse slow with river water, 
and when he opens his eyes 
you tell him calm and sure 
how a woman birthed him 
back whole again.

1    There are few probabilities through 
      Which dreamers do not pass. . . 

      The first dream 
      Is the bright red dream 
      Of our mother’s heart. 
      It is her sacrifice 
      Of something eternal 
      In herself, for us. 
      The Arabs say 
      Blood has flowed 
      Let us begin again. 

      The heart is like a cup, or a coffer, 
      or a cave. It holds the image of the 
      sun within us. It is a center of illumination 
      and happiness and wisdom. To dream 
      of the heart is always to dream of 
      the importance of love. . . 

      The second dream is the inauguration 
      Of the soul. In this dream we are 
      Confronted by a host of birds. . . 

      Some were guileless 
      Like the doves, 
      Said Odo of Tusculum, 
      Cunning 
      Like the partridges. 
      Some came to the hand 
      Like the hawks. 
      Others fled from it 
      Like the hens, 
      Some enjoyed the company 
      Of people 
      Like swallows, 
      Others preferred solitude 
      Like the turtledoves, 
      But all eventually flew away. 

      “Living is not necessary, but navigation 
      is,” said Pompey the Great. 

      B. 1725, London 
      Mother devout as gunpowder 
      Seemingly clairvoyant 
      Taught her only child 
      To read by four 
      Arithmetic and Latin by six 
      Dies when he is seven. 

      I am dreaming 
      I am in the dark 
      And it is raining 
      And she is the rain. 

      To dream that you are in the dark 
      is a sign of difficulties ahead; if 
      you fall or hurt yourself you can expect 
      a change for the worse, but if you 
      succeed in groping to the light, that 
      is another matter. . . 

      Father, master of ships, 
      Lively in the Mediterranean trade, 
      Unusual qualities — 
      Educated in Spain, stern. 

      I listen to nothing 
      But the silence 
      Of my father; the dream 
      Says 
      He is the rudder 
      And the compass. 

      If, in your dreams, you see your 
      father and he speaks to you, it is 
      a sign of coming happiness. If he is 
      silent, or if he appears to be ill or 
      dead, then you may expect trouble. . . 

      Sent to sea at ten, 
      Acted like a verb in disagreement, 
      Of course 
      Bright, 
      But no eagle — 
      A mess. 

      I have vague 
      Dreams now 
      Of intelligent flowers. 
      I cannot say 
      If their roots 
      Are in the ground 
      Or in the air. 

      By seventeen 
      A wildflower 
      In the field of Jesus. 
      Pious, books, fasting, 
      Abstinence from meat, 
      A canon in his meditation 
      And silence, 
      But like the weeds 
      Loved to curse. 

      Flowers, one of nature’s best dreams. 
      This foretells great happiness, unless 
      you throw away the blossoms. . . 

      1742 
      A lot more flexible, 
      Falls in love, 
      Misses his ship, 
      A freethinker now, 
      Less of a thorn 
      In the side of God. 

      I dream that I 
      Am always with her, 
      A freckle on her wrist, 
      A flower in her hair, 
      A ridiculous flying fish — 
      Sliced 
      And dressed 
      And set on the table. 

      As I told you before, 
      He missed his ship, 
      Became a lover 
      Rather than a Jamaican 
      Planter, 
      Father as expected 
      Furious. 

      Love is a dream of contraries as far 
      as sweethearts are concerned. To dream 
      that you do not succeed in love is a 
      sign that you will marry and have 
      a happy life. To dream that you are in 
      the company of your lover is also fortunate. . . 

      Late 1743 
      Kidnapped into the Navy 
      (What else) 
      Coming from Mary’s house. 
      Taken from his own life, 
      Focused into new pieces. 

      I dream about my fortune, 
      A fragrance captured 
      In a jar, 
      A freckle without a wrist, 
      A wisp 
      Foxlike at the edge 
      Of the wind. 

      Fortune is a dream of contraries: the more 
      fortunate and successful you are in imagination, 
      the greater will be your real struggles. . . 

      How do we fit together 
      When we are not free? 
      What kind of animal are we? 
      How many heads do we have? 
      How many tails? 
      The sea 
      Is a strange piece of property 
      On which to discuss this, 

      On the hms Hardwick 
      One month later 
      Midshipman John Newton: 
      I have eaten war 
      Like a cluster 
      Of delicious fruit. 
      The ironic juices 
      Running from my lips 
      That was my dream. 

      The reality of war is the dream of it. Beware 
      of those things that appear so friendly 
      but have no reason. . . 

      1774 
      The Hardwick 
      Ordered to the East Indies. 
      First our hero visits Mary again. 
      (You’re wrong) 
      Almost misses ship, 
      Completely misses the point. 
      Given small boat of men 
      To go ashore at Plymouth, 
      Deserts. 

      My dreams here 
      Were father, compass, 
      Fog, leakage, 
      And ultimately, learning, 
      With us 
      Like our laundry. 

      We are always pulling from our past. Fossils 
      are the dream of the sickness of someone 
      you have not met for a long time. When 
      this happens brew herbs, add honey 
      and lemon, sip and inhale deeply. . . 

      Captured like a frog, 
      Returned, put in irons, 
      Stripped, flogged, degraded, 
      Returned to foremast. 

      This is that point many people would 
      call a black moment, an unfortunate 
      color on things. I will not do that. For 
      black is a contrary at funerals and our 
      hero has just died a little as we 
      all tend to from time to time. And even 
      though that is true I will not do 
      that either. I will not talk of the great 
      white moment of death, I will not talk 
      of the great blue and purple moments 
      in the prosperity of pain. I will not 
      talk of the great red or scarlet moments 
      of quarrels and loss of friends, or 
      the crimson pleasure of the unexpected, 
      the mental tints of yellow and orange 
      that show you should always expect 
      change, or the feeling of knowing green 
      because you have been on a long journey. 
      All the colors are conjurers when our 
      mysteries are being solved. And if this could 
      not be his dream then by now it should 
      be ours. . . 

      We are not holy 
      The wind says in the sails 
      As he works. 
      It has never been otherwise 
      Though we live in the most 
      Devout of stories like litmus paper 
      Constantly changing color 
      Just to prove something 
      Is happening. 

      The sadness in his dream is a good omen 
      for the future. It is a quest for lasting joy, 
      and so is punishment a dream of unexpected 
      pleasure. . . 

      Works quietly for weeks. 
      His silence 
      Darns a temperate 
      Healing thread 
      His eyes 
      Become an elaborate 
      Decorative art 
      Avoiding everyone. 

      “Every month,” said Cicero 
      “the moon contemplates 
      its trajectory 
      and the shrubs 
      and animals grow.” 

      He has done to himself 
      What is easy. 
      He must now blossom 
      Out of his new secrets 
      Even if joy is ephemeral. 

      Suddenly 
      He begins to sing, 
      Creates songs about fish 
      And clouds. 

      Fish are a dream of penetrative motion, 
      clouds are a dream of appearances always 
      in a state of change. . . 

      We must be patient 
      With the overfecundity 
      Of his youth. 
      We must let him 
      Climb and descend the mast 
      Like a weapon. 
      Trade him 
      To a slaver’s ship 
      To subdue the threat 
      To discipline 
      In his strangely awakening 
      Joy. 
      We must let him 
      Choose his monsters 
      And the myths 
      Of his own worth — 
      The enemy always being 
      The forces threatening 
      From within. 

      Paul said, “We wrestle not against flesh 
      and blood, but against principalities, against 
      powers, against the rulers of the darkness 
      of this world, against spiritual wickedness in 
      high places. . .” 

      Suddenly, 
      Begins to breathe 
      Different songs 
      In his six-months’ stay 
      Along the Sierra Leone coast. 
      Troublesome songs, 
      Songs of quick wit 
      And devastating rhymes 
      Ridiculing ship’s officers, 
      Crew loves them, 
      Becomes a choir. 

      To dream that you hear other people 
      singing shows that the difficulties 
      that will come for you will come through 
      your dealings with other people. . . 

      The irate mate 
      Assuming command 
      After the death of the captain 
      Threatens 
      To put Newton 
      On a man-o’-war. 

      The Royal Navy is not an obstacle dream; 
      it is an elaborate exhibition of the 
      nuances of living death. . . 
      Occupation: slave dealer 
      Place: Sierra Leone 
      On one of the Plantanes 
      Features: Short, white male 
      Name: Clow 
      Other information: Black wife 
      Name: sounds like P.I. 

      John Newton 
      Bargains his life 
      Into this extravagant story. 
      He will become a slave 
      Because P.I. will hate him. 
      He will become ill 
      With fever. 
      He will be denied 
      Food, 
      Denied water, 
      Tormented by Black slaves 
      On command, 
      Put to work 
      On a lime tree plantation 
      Enjoying only the scents 
      And dreaming 
      Of his earthly desires, 
      Will master the six books 
      Of Euclid, 
      Drawing the diagrams 
      With a long stick 
      In the wet sand. 

      Six is, like two, a particularly ambiguous 
      number to dream about, but it 
      establishes equilibrium. It unifies 
      the triangles of fire and water and 
      symbolizes the human soul. Six is 
      the hermaphrodite, a personality integrated 
      despite its duality. 

      If this is a story 
      Of the reasoning of slavery, 
      Where are we? 
      What have we been doing 
      To people, 
      To the light 
      From which life emanates? 

      Slavery is a story 
      Of procreation, 
      Of magic religious thinking, 
      Of the androgynous divinity 
      Within us. 
      No story can be this happy 
      Unless it is married 
      To something deeply within us. 
      It is not them 
      Who have done it to us, 
      Or us 
      Who have done it to them. 
      It is the antagonistic dream 
      Of unreconciled love. 

      To dream of erotic love is to dream of 
      the desire to die in the object of desire, to 
      dissolve in that which is already 
      dissolved. The Book of Baruch says erotic 
      desire and its satisfaction is the key 
      to the origin of the world. Disappointment 
      in love and the revenge which follows 
      in its wake are the roots of all the evil 
      and selfishness in the world. The whole 
      of history is the work of love. 

2    “The character of the image,” said Shukrâchârya, 
      “is determined by the relationship between 
      the worshipper and the worshipped.” 

      On the beach, 
      He eats the fruit 
      Of his own way; 
      He fills himself 
      With his own devices; 
      He continues to draw 
      In the sand. 

      Each grain 
      Is a small, 
      Precise form 
      Of salvation 
      That has occurred, 
      A god come to earth 
      In another form, 
      A private, 
      Innate sacrifice. 
      Providence does not tire. 
      We are ready to go on 
      With the story. 

      It has come to this: 
      When his father dreams 
      He only sees 
      The broad face 
      Of sadness, 
      The soft grassland 
      Where only asphodels grow, 
      And the idea of water 
      Expanding into tears. 

      But to dream of sadness is a good 
      omen, a transportation of suffering to the 
      spiritual: this dream is like an herb, 
      a seasoning, a bitter root, medicinal, 
      something poisonous, but nevertheless 
      something that eventually withers away. 

      When you 
      Come on to squally weather, 
      When the wind 
      Is about SW, 
      When 
      You sway up the yard 
      Fix the trysail, 
      Put people to making 
      Sennit and swab, 
      Ask for my son. 
      Ask the Lamb, 
      The Beverly, the Golden Lyon, 
      Ask Job Lewis, 
      Have you seen my boy? 
      Have you seen my boy? 

      One thousand years before Christ, Solomon 
      said that the way of a ship in the midst 
      of the sea was too wonderful for him 
      to understand. 

      Meanwhile, 
      Clow: shamed 
      Into freeing his fellow 
      White man. 
      After all 
      They share the same hair, 
      The same instinctual life, 
      The same irrational power. 
      There is no victim here: 
      This is a story of love’s 
      Sadness, 
      Of the spirit of love’s ferocity 
      And savage insensibility, 
      And the name of Jesus 
      Turned in hymns, 
      Spewed into the fringes 
      Of the forest, 
      Spewed on the deep blue sea. 

      What dream is this, is that what you said? 
      My God, this is the dream of the dragon, 
      the fabulous animal, the amalgam of 
      aggression, the serpent, the crocodile, the 
      lion, what we like to think is the 
      antediluvian nature of love. 

      John is free now. 
      John is free to slave, 
      Free to be reluctant, 
      To give up profit 
      and return home. 

      Ask the master of the Greyhound. 
      Have you seen my boy? 
      Have you seen my boy? 

      To find money in your dream is not fortunate 
      at all. There will be some sudden advancement 
      or success, but it will prove 
      disappointing. Reader, remember this 
      statement by Virgil, “It will be pleasant 
      to remember these things hereafter.” 

      You cannot blame 
      The sea on a woman. 
      Unlike the seasons 
      It has no ribs 
      Though 
      It has a crown, 
      Wears a sheath, 
      Swings a sickle, 
      Adores the sun, 
      And is known 
      As bareheaded and leafless. 
      The sea is the emblem 
      Of the great capricious world; 
      The naked image of flux 
      Vibrating between life and death. 

      There is a dream called “Dire is the tossing 
      deep the groans; come let us heel, list 
      and stoop.” And when John heard this 
      on his way home, it was as if he 
      had read 2 Kings 10:16, “Come with me 
      [brother] and see my zeal for the lord.” 

      For twelve months 
      The Greyhound 
      Sought gold, 
      Ivory, dyer’s wood, 
      Beeswax, 
      And Newton sought the Lord. 

      The way of a ship in the midst of the sea 
      is too wonderful to understand. 

      Youth is not innocence. 
      It is not a militant puzzlement. 
      It is a methodological initiation 
      Into the ubiquitous life 
      Of sin. 
      For a life without sin 
      Is no life at all. 
      And so he wanders on 
      Like Paul, 
      So very Christian about it, 
      At once wretched and delivered. 
      Thinking with his mind 
      He is serving God, 
      But with his flesh 
      The law of sin. 

      Call out John Newton. 
      Call out 
      To Joshua, Ruth, 
      Samuel, Obadiah, 
      Esther, Zechariah, 
      Luke and Timothy. 
      The world 
      Is a masterfully round 
      Secret 
      That embraces everything, 
      And it is time 
      To reach into the horizon, 
      Now. 
      It is time to choose 
      Your ship, 
      And the triangle of your life 
      Upon the salty sea. 

      As you can see, dreams are without reason, 
      without solution, without proof, the 
      unedited version of our love, our aspiration, 
      our hurt. . . Call out John Newton. Call out. . . 

      Back home 
      Offered captaincy of ship. 
      Refuses. 
      Sails as first mate 
      On the Brownlow. 

      Collects slaves. 
      Takes them to South Carolina. 

      He begins to dream of questions: “What 
      was the mode used in stowing the slaves 
      in their apartments?” 

      Returns home, 
      Marries Mary Cattlett, 
      Assumes first command, 
      The Duke of Argyle, 
      140 tons burthen. 

      Marriage is the dream of sulfur and 
      mercury. Some believe it is a most fortunate 
      omen, a volatile conciliation, a fragile 
      union. They are right. It is one of the great 
      uncharted seas of individuation. It is 
      said, “If you are separated from your 
      opposite you consume yourself away. . .” 

      Dead reckoning 
      Magnetical Amplitude          W° 25.30N° 
      True Amplitude                   W° 6.30° 
      Variation                            19° in Western 
      Lattitude per Account          50° 48m 

      One-third of the slaves will die 
      In middle passage 
      Some say fifty million 
      Started the trip 
      Some say fifteen. 

      The dream of questions is a bright necklace 
      with two ornaments on it: liberty and 
      love, not truth. 

      “At noon some small rain. . . 
      Had an indifferent observation. . .” 

      “We take the two men-boys 
      For some shallop rigging, 
      We do not take 
      The two fallen-breasted women. . .” 

      “Dear Mary, 
                  Today, saw 
                  My quondam Black 
                  Mistress P.I. — 
                  I believe 
                  I made her sorry 
                  For her former ill 
                  Treatment of me.” 

      The trouble with atonement is it is like 
      a sphinx, several parts human, several 
      parts bull, dog, lion, dragon, or bird. 
      When we are dreaming of atonement, no 
      matter how subtly, we must remember 
      we are not dreaming of a verb. 

      “I watch them work 
      The tie, tackle, 
      And lower lift. 
      The boatswain 
      Speaks to Bredson 
      About the score 
      In one of the strops. 
      Thomas Creed 
      Sits with his splicing fids; 
      Tucks the strands 
      Of the tack cringle. 
      His fingers are either 
      Little mystics or snakes.” 

      When you dream the dream of square-sail 
      rigging you are dreaming the dream 
      that the same side is always before 
      the wind. At the dawn of Swedish history 
      it was believed Erik Vädderhatt, the 
      King of the Svear, could turn the wind 
      and cruise endlessly. Ships are supposed 
      to be emblems of transcendental joy. . . 

      “Do the male slaves 
      Ever dance 
      Under these circumstances?” 

      “After every meal 
      They are made to jump 
      In their irons; 
      But I cannot call it dancing.” 

      “What is the term 
      That is usually given to it?” 

      “It is by the slave dealers 
      Called dancing.” 

      “Unclewed the sails. 
      They too in their shackles 
      Danced in the wind.” 

      “Dear Mary, 
                  I watched the land wind 
                  Do to the sails 
                  What it does 
                  To our hair. 
                  I dreamed of dancing 
                  With you 
                  Into the cold water, 
                  Our wet clothes 
                  Like nets and entanglements 
                  Around our desire.” 

      They would call them up 
      Two by two, equivocal, 
      Unmasked, 
      Making it possible 
      To be classified 
      Forever: 
      Pairs of birds, 
      Pairs of oxen, 
      Pairs of sheep, 
      Reptiles, lions, 
      Elephants, antediluvian, 
      Carnivorous, herbivorous, 
      Fabulous, beautiful, 
      Ugly, strange, 
      Cocks, locusts, bears, 
      Foxes, and even flies, 
      All of them black; 
      All of them in colonnade 
      To the gates of hell. 

      John did baptize 
      In the wilderness, 
      Did call out to Judæa 
      And Jerusalem 
      Come lay down 
      Your life 
      In the River Jordan, 
      Participate in his death 
      And his resurrection. 

      They said 
      They were refreshing them, 
      But the shackles still clanged, 
      And most of them still stank, 
      And many finding holes 
      In the netting 
      Jumped overboard 
      And baptized themselves 
      Bobbing in the adoring 
      Loins of the sea. 

      “Dear Mary, 
                  The three greatest blessings 
                  Of which human nature is capable 
                  Are undoubtedly religion, 
                  Liberty and love.” 

      The shape of a ship’s hull is determined by 
      the materials, methods of construction, 
      means of propulsion, use, fashion, and 
      whim. This is a dream of law and 
      the minute verities of justice, the eighth 
      enigma of the tarot. 

      First part fair, 
      The latter cloudy, 
      Winds becoming unusual, 
      Clouds dark, great lightning. . . 
      I think of what we’ve done, 
      My own illumination 
      Before it is too late: 

      The palm and needle whippings, 
      The short splice, 
      Blackwall hitches, 
      Sheet bends. 

      Quickly rummage 
      The rigging details, 
      The yardarm blocks, 
      The tackles. 

      Recall work 
      On the pintles, 
      The rudder head. 

      Have Billinge 
      Check barricado and stores, 
      Especially powder and slaves. 

      On this day 
      Of the second voyage 
      Of The African, 1754, 
      Weighed, 
      Bound by God’s permission 
      To St. Christophers, 
      We are ready for our justice, 
      To be winnowed like barley 
      On the threshing floor. 

      The great dream of the dark, with the 
      lonely extroverted lamp, the intuitive ship, 
      and the wind tossing on the innovative sea 
      should moor somewhere. “Why is this 
      so?” asked Kuo Hsi. For in our landscapes 
      and our seascapes are the personalized items 
      of our consciousness, the coarse grist 
      of our imagination, the flirtatious metaphors 
      stirring our ethics, and the boldly stroked 
      delineations of our unraveling possibilities 
      and original nature. 

      Through the night 
      We were played with 
      Like kittens. 
      The slaves spilled 
      Out nightmares of themselves 
      And groans. 
      We will all 
      Need dawn’s shawl 
      This morning. 
      I hope 
      She is good to us. 

      Osiris was slain by Set and put 
      together again by Isis. John will dream 
      like this, off and on, and then quit the 
      sea. This is his last voyage. He will 
      lose no slaves and no crew, and it will 
      be called a blessing. At a time like 
      this the Egyptians would build a 
      monolith to marry the enigmatic tension 
      between life and death. John will 
      change his dreams, now, from the menstrual 
      dreams of the slaver to the menthol dreams 
      of the minister. Showing the devastating evil 
      we do, like a storm, is only a stepping- 
      stone to something else. 
      Sing brother. 

      I will become sermons, 
      He says, 
      That understand what I’ve done. 
      Sing 
      I will become hymns 
      Bound in the skin 
      Of what I’ve done. 
      I will be patient with Cowper, 
      Inspiring to Wilberforce 
                      And Wordsworth; 
      I will attract the awakened crowds, 
      The abolitionist. 
      I will stand at the altar. 
      Sing brother 
      Dressed in black, 
      Testifying, 
      Testifying. . . 

      I dream I will not be forgiving him 
      for the timeliness of his innocence, for 
      betrothing the dead to the dead, 
      but will be lifting 
      up my hands to an appetite for life 
      that will take slavers and slaves with me. 

      I wish 
      There was no timelessness, 
      That slavery was over 
      And so far away 
      It was an incredibly mysterious 
      Jungle — 
      Somewhere else. 
      An uncharted river 
      Canopied by extensive moss — 
      Somewhere else. 
      A spectacular ragged 
      Waterfall 
      Mystically expressed 
      Over an enormous 
      Obsidian wall, 
      But it is right here 
      In my pouch, today, 
      Like the acori beads 
      I have been swimming with 
      For hours — 
      Presidential, prime ministerial, 
      Corporate, grassroots based. 
      Right here, 
      Racist, imperial, and sexist. 
      Right here, 
      Woefully spendthrift 
      And Democratic, 
      Anally retentive 
      And Republican, 
      Militantly inappropriate, 
      And so good to itself 
      That it jogs.

title : Acts of Vexation

author : Pam Rehm

text : 
The only thing under the sun 
I can run to 
is Ecclesiastes 

for there is nothing gathered into one self 
that can be kept 

Want is humbled by death 
as every purpose manifests it 

Feeling this all my life 
a piercing fright 
gathers in the stomach's pit 

This is it and this is not the end 
of the road 

for even despair is a kind of goad 
to wisdom 

The beauty of the world 
over one's own anguish 

The day that I lost all feeling 

I was both a Fool and a Goddess

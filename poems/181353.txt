title : A Christmas Song

author : Norman Williams

text : 
Christmas is coming. The goose is getting fat 
                        Please put a penny in the old man’s hat. 
                        If you haven’t got a penny, a ha’penny will do. 
                        If you haven’t got a ha’penny, Gold bless you. 

Tonight the wide, wet flakes of snow 
Drift down like Christmas suicides, 
Layering the eaves and boughs until 
The landscape seems transformed, as from 
A night of talk or love. I’ve come 
From cankered ports and railroad hubs 
To winter in a northern state: 
Three months of wind and little light. 
Wood split, flue cleaned, and ashes hauled, 
I am now proof against the cold 
And make a place before the stove. 
Mired fast in middle age, possessed 
Of staved-in barn and brambled lot, 
I think of that fierce-minded woman 
Whom I loved, painting in a small, 
Unheated room, or of a friend, 
Sharp-ribbed from poverty, who framed 
And fitted out his house by hand 
And writes each night by kerosene. 
I think, that is, of others who 
Withdrew from commerce and the world 
To work for joy instead of gain. 
O would that I could gather them 
This Yuletide, and shower them with coins.

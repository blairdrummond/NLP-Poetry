title : Against Epiphany

author : Fred Marchant

text : 
What god was it that would open
 earth’s picture book and see the two
 of us on a road, snowfields glittering
 on every side and poplars bent like
 the fingers of an old man clutching
 what he loved about the sun?
  
 Which one was it that would peer 
 into our thatched, white-washed
 farmhouse, and see the fur, flies,
 and shit-stained walls? Which one
 laughed at the barbed wire fences, 
 the wall topped with broken glass?
  
 Which of the many who came then,
 gleaming and rimed in hard sunlight?
 Which of those who bobbed like ice
 along the winter shore? What did
 we have that any god would want?
 Quick, if you can find it, hide it.

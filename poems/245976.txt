                       at the altarpiece of Saint Teresa
No need to be coy—
 you know what 
 she’s doing
  

And so did Bernini,
 when he found Teresa 
 in the full-throttle of
 her divine vision,
             caught her at it, 
  
 carving this surrender
 so fluidly you expect
 the impossible:
  
 for her tang to swell up, ripe
 as seafoam, from the gulf
 of her flushed and falling
 figure. Perhaps this is how
  
 God comes to us, 
 or should come to us, all:
  
 the bluntly and 
 beautifully corporeal at
  
 prayers in the Sunday
 school of pleasure. Why
  
 shouldn’t He come to us
 as He did to Teresa? A saint
  
 on her back—
 a girl tearing open 
 the gift He gave her?

Sewn straw, exact pattern. Fields of rice-sprigs
 evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.
 The town, a sea of gunmetal, fish-scale tiles.
  
 By morning each floor a casserole of pillows,
 coverlets, comforters, towels:    flown nests. Imprint
 of bodies, fading. They fold the beds away,
 the room waits empty all day.
                                                        All day the bodies
 circle, leaving no impression on each
 other. Tooled in the foundry of the streets.
 School-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train:
 one territorial imperative,
 an emperor’s.
                           On his platform one yard square
 perched on a roof that slopes in waves of tiles
 up toward other tiled cascades, the karate student
 for  hours does running in place, deep knee bends
 on his surfboard perch. All his free time to make
 his body efficient, tight, exact, rising
 and falling, mint piston pumping in its shaft.

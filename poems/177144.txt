title : Adventures in New Testament Greek: Nous

author : Scott Cairns

text : 
You could almost think the word synonymous   
with mind, given our so far narrow   
history, and the excessive esteem 

in which we have been led to hold what is,   
in this case, our rightly designated   
nervous systems. Little wonder then 

that some presume the mind itself both part   
and parcel of the person, the very seat   
of soul and, lately, crucible for a host 

of chemical incentives—combinations 
of which can pretty much answer for most   
of our habits and for our affections. 

When even the handy lexicon cannot   
quite place the nous as anything beyond   
one rustic ancestor of reason, you might 

be satisfied to trouble the odd term   
no further—and so would fail to find   
your way to it, most fruitful faculty 

untried. Dormant in its roaring cave, 
the heart’s intellective aptitude grows dim,   
unless you find a way to wake it. So, 

let’s try something, even now. Even as   
you tend these lines, attend for a moment   
to your breath as you draw it in: regard 

the breath’s cool descent, a stream from mouth   
to throat to the furnace of the heart.   
Observe that queer, cool confluence of breath 

and blood, and do your thinking there.

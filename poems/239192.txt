text : 
In the back of the junkhouse 
stacked on a cardtable covered 
by a ragged bedspread, they rest, 
black platters whose music once 
crackled, hissed with a static 
like shuffling feet, fox trot or two-step, 
the slow dance of the needle 
riding its merry-go-round, 
my mother’s head nestled 
on my father’s shoulder as they  
turned, lost in the sway of sounds, 
summer nights and faraway 
places, the syncopation of time 
waltzing them to a world 
they never dreamed, dance 
of then to the dust of now.

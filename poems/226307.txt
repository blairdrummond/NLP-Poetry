title : Requiem for the New Year

author : Mary Karr

text : 
On this first dark day of the year 
      my daddy was born lo 
these eighty-six years ago who now 
      has not drawn breath or held 
bodily mass for some ten years and still   
      I have not got used to it. 
My mind can still form to that chair him   
      whom no chair holds. 
Each year on this night on the brink 
      of new circumference I stand and gaze 
towards him, while roads careen with drunks,   
      and my dad who drank himself 
away cannot be found. Daddy, I’m halfway   
      to death myself. The millenium 
hurtles towards me, and the boy I bore   
      who bears your fire in his limbs 
follows in my wake. Why can you not be   
      reborn all tall to me? If I raise my arms 
here in the blind dark, why can you not   
      reach down now to hoist me up? 
This heavy carcass I derive from yours is   
      tutelage of love, and yet each year 
though older another notch I still cannot stand   
      to reach you, or to emigrate 
from the monolithic shadow you left.

title : Dreams

author : Nikki Giovanni

text : 
in my younger years 
before i learned 
black people aren’t 
suppose to dream 
i wanted to be 
a raelet 
and say “dr o wn d in my youn tears” 
or “tal kin bout tal kin bout” 
or marjorie hendricks and grind   
all up against the mic 
and scream 
“baaaaaby nightandday   
baaaaaby nightandday” 
then as i grew and matured 
i became more sensible   
and decided i would   
settle down 
and just become 
a sweet inspiration

were lifted over the valley, its steepling dustdevils
 the redwinged blackbirds convened
 vibrant arc their swift, their dive against the filmy, the finite air
  
 the profession of absence, of being absented, a lifting skyward
 then gone
 the moment of flight: another resignation from the sweep of earth
  
 jackrabbit, swallowtail, harlequin duck: believe in this refuge
 vivid tips of oleander
 white and red perimeters where no perimeter should be
  
  
  
                here is another in my long list of asides:
 why have I never had a clock that actually gained time?
 that apparatus, which measures out the minutes, is our own image
                          forever losing
  
 and so the delicate, unfixed condition of love, the treacherous body
 the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged—
 isn’t one a suitable lens through which to see another:
                filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land
  
  
  
 and by resilient I mean which holds
               which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment
 the experiment, the untried & untrue, the last stab at wellness
  
 choose your own adventure: drug failure or organ failure
 cataclysmic climate change
 or something akin to what’s killing bees—colony collapse
  
 more like us than we’d allow, this wondrous swatch of rough
  
  
  
 why do I need to say the toads and moor and clouds—﻿
 in a spring of misunderstanding, I took the cricket’s sound
  
 and delight I took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
 the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
 anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
              to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest’s edge
  
 until the nocturnal animals crept forth
              their eyes like the lamps in store windows
                           forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home
  
 hence, the body’s burden, its resolute campaign:  trudge on
  
 and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will
  
 I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried
              a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
 for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere
  
  
  
 by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures:
 sprig of lilac, scent of pine
 the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song
  
 the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
               and the cherry forms its first full buds
 the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
               and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
 growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum
  
  
  
 daily, I mistake—there was a medication I forgot to take
 there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & I refused him
  
 in a protracted stillness, I saw that heron I didn’t wish to disturb
 was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud’s limbs
  
 I did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until—
               daylight, don’t leave me now, I haven’t done with you—
                             nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace
  
  
  
 if I, inconsequential being that I am, forsake all others
 how many others correspondingly forsake this world
  
  
  
                light, light: do not go
 I sing you this song and I will sing another as well

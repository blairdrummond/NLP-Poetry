title : Describe Turner to MLK

I
    

 The weight of my son
                              at the emergency room
                       for an eye injury, sack of flour, sack of salt,
                                             dusty bag of bones
                                                          collapsed
                                                                         after all those tears.
                             Why does Turner
                                  come to mind,
                                                         those shackled ankles,
                             those drowning slaves?

 And horizons.
                                 Each measure, each cleaving
 of flesh to soil, breath to sentence, body
                                              toward earth. The shepherd
                                                 watches his flock
                                                          cross the stream;
                                              nymphs bathe and flirt
                                  and sun themselves on rocks. Water
                                                               against ankles, pebbles
                                                                              beneath feet.

 An old woman sits next to us,
                                            and every time she shifts
                             in her seat,
                                                  I can hear her bones click.
               Dying,
                             her faulty architecture
                                          like an old radiator,
                                                        cooling engine.

 The burden
                                 of seeing, explosive sunlight,
                the swirling painted water
                                      pouring over Turner’s slaves.
                                                                            My son
                                                            sleeps. Have you ever walked
                                                                          out
                                                                                  into the sticky heat
                         of a Memphis night
                                        and asked for gunshots
                                                      to stop for just one hot hour?
               O heap of body, heap of bones,
                                                          heap of dreams, heap of moans.


V 
  
  
 A story with a happy ending
                and no answers,
                            slight corneal scratch
                     healed with anti-bacterial rinse,
          the eyeball’s protective pocket
                            cupping the universe
               like a calm inlet
                                     offering a foundering ship
                                            protection from rough seas. You tell me:
 What washes blood from a balcony?
 I’m listening. I’m saying please. 
               The sun rises quickly.
               And so do sea monsters.

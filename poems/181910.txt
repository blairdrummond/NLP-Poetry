title : [The order of islands here]

text : 
The order of islands here 
If you take it 

will I give it back 
at two o’clock 

Will you hold it 
in my hand 

And the relation to an eyelid 
by the quantity of light 

As in 
His story’s impossible to read 

As in 
We’ll see it just in time 

whenever we find it 
missing

title : What's Wrong

author : Landis Everson

"What you are struggling with," said 
the psychologist, "is 
a continuous song, something like 
a telephone's tone. Nebulous, noncommittal, 
unrelenting, pretending 
to give you messages it can't deliver. 

Because the body is unattached. It is," 
he said, "like a valentine sent 
out cold, beautiful, brittle as tomorrow's 
deja-vu, but distortedly misaddressed. 
These pills will help you 
find yourself 
somewhere where the lace ends up loose 
and the paste is still humming 
all about you.

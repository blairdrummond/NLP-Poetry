title : Passing Over Your Virtues

author : Vicki Hearne

text : 
To pass over in silence
Is to acknowledge logic,
The necessity of form,
 
The stunning curve of language,
The curious way it seems
To turn out that “love” means “need”
 
Even in a lush garden.
To pass over the Red Sea
Or your bounty—so long as
 
True silence and not some tense
Paralysis of the false
Is achieved—then Passover
 
Is always a charity,
The painted fish in the blue
Water turns to their own colors.
 
To pass over in silence
Is to acknowledge you if
This chatter dissolve as it
 
Will in the marvelous sky.

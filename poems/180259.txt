title : The Story of the End of the Story

author : James Galvin

text : 
To keep from ending 
The story does everything it can, 
Careful not to overvalue 
Perfection or undervalue 
Perfect chance, 
As I am careful not to do in telling. 
By now a lot has happened: 
Bridges under the water, 
No time outs, 
Sinewy voices from under the earth 
Braiding and going straight up 
In a faint line. 
I modify to simplify, 
Complicate to clarify. 
If you want to know your faults, marry. 
If you want to know your virtues, die. 
Then the heroine, 
Who resembles you in certain particulars, 
Precipitates the suicide 
Of the author, wretchedly obscure, 
Of that slim but turgid volume, 
By letting slip: 
Real events don't have endings, 
Only the stories about them do.

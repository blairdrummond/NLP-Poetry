title : Havana Birth

Off Havana, the ocean is green this morning 
of my birth. The conchers clean their knives on leather 
straps and watch the sky while three couples 
who have been dancing on the deck of a ship 
in the harbor, the old harbor of the fifties, kiss 
each other's cheeks and call it a night. 

On a green sofa five dresses wait 
to be fitted. The seamstress kneeling at Mother's feet 
has no idea I am about to be born. Mother 
pats her stomach which is flat 
as the lace mats on the dressmaker's table. She thinks 
I'm playing in my room. But as usual, she's wrong. 

I'm about to be born in a park in Havana. Oh, 
this is important, everything in the dressmaker's house 
is furred like a cat. And Havana leans right up 
against the windows. In the park, the air 
is chocolate, the sweet breath of a man 
smoking an expensive cigar. The grass 

is drinkable, dazzling, white. In a moment 
I'll get up from a bench, lured 
by a flock of pigeons, lazily sipping 
the same syrupy music through a straw. 
Mother is so ignorant, she thinks 
I'm rolled like a ball of yarn under the bed. What 

does she know of how I got trapped in my life? 
She thinks it's all behind her, the bloody 
sheets, the mirror in the ceiling 
where I opened such a sudden furious blue, her eyes 
bruised shut like mine. The pigeon's eyes 
are orange, unblinking, a doll's. Mother always said 

I wanted to touch everything because 
I was a child. But I was younger than that. 
I was so young I thought whatever I 
wanted, the world wanted too. Workers 
in the fields wanted the glint of sun on their machetes. 
Sugarcane came naturally sweet, you 

had only to lick the earth where it grew. 
The music I heard each night outside 
my window lived in the mouth of a bird. I was so young 
I thought it was easy as walking 
into the ocean which always had room 
for my body. So when I held out my hands 

I expected the pigeon to float between them 
like a blossom, dusting my fingers with the manna 
of its wings. But the world is wily, and doesn't want 
to be held for long, which is why 
as my hands reached out, workers lay down 
their machetes and left the fields, which is why 

a prostitute in a little calle of Havana dreamed 
the world was a peach and flicked 
open a knife. And Mother, startled, shook 
out a dress with big peonies splashed like dirt 
across the front, as if she had fallen 
chasing after me in the rain. But what could I do? 

I was about to be born, I was about to have 
my hair combed into the new music 
everyone was singing. The dressmaker sang it, her mouth 
filled with pins. The butcher sang it and wiped 
blood on his apron. Mother sang it and thought her body 
was leaving her body. And when I tried 

I was so young the music beat right 
through me, which is how the pigeon got away. 
The song the world sings day after day 
isn't made of feathers, and the song a bird pours 
itself into is tough as a branch 
growing with the singer and the singer's delight.

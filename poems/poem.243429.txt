Rhymed Stanza

                  Up here, with June, the sycamore throws
                      Across the window a whispering screen;
        I shall miss the sycamore more, I suppose,
Than anything else on this earth that is out in green.
             But I mean to go through the door without fear,
             Not caring much what happens here
                           When I'm away:--
How green the screen is across the panes
              Or who goes laughing along the lanes
        With my old lover all summer day.

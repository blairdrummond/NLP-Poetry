title : Listening

author : David Ignatow

text : 
You wept in your mother's arms   
and I knew that from then on   
I was to forget myself. 

Listening to your sobs, 
I was resolved against my will   
to do well by us 
and so I said, without thinking,   
in great panic, To do wrong   
in one's own judgment, 
though others thrive by it, 
is the right road to blessedness.   
Not to submit to error 
is in itself wrong 
and pride. 

Standing beside you, 
I took an oath 
to make your life simpler   
by complicating mine 
and what I always thought   
would happen did: 
I was lifted up in joy.

Sometimes I want a corset like
 to harden me or garnish. I
 think of this stricture—rain
 language, building—as a corset: an
 outer ideal mould, I feel
 the ideal moulding me the ideal
 is now my surface just so very
 perfect I know where to buy it and I
 take it off. I take it off. If all things fall
 and we are just emperors, serious
 and accurate and fugitive
 in such dormant lines of gorgeousness
 the day is a locksmith
 dew lies long on the grass
 and I a rustic ask: what is
 a surface—and respond
 only omniscience, the crumpling face
 as the domestic emotions elucidate
 themselves a sea of mist
 exists so strangely side by side
 the potent mould of anarchy and scorn.

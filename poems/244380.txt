father, it was an honor to be there, in the dugout
 with you, the glory of great black men swinging their lives
 as bats, at tiny white balls
 burning in at unbelievable speeds, riding up & in & out
 a curve breaking down wicked, like a ball falling off a table
 moving away, snaking down, screwing its stitched magic
 into chitlin circuit air, its comma seams spinning
 toward breakdown, dipping, like a hipster
 bebopping a knee-dip stride, in the charlie parker forties
 wrist curling, like a swan’s neck
 behind a slick black back
 cupping an invisible ball of dreams
  
 & you there, father, regal, as an african, obeah man
 sculpted out of wood, from a sacred tree, of no name, no place, origin
 thick branches branching down, into cherokee & someplace else lost
 way back in africa, the sap running dry
 crossing from north carolina into georgia, inside grandmother mary’s
 womb, where your mother had you in the violence of that red soil
 ink blotter news, gone now, into blood graves
 of american blues, sponging rococo
 truth long gone as dinosaurs
 the agent-oranged landscape of former names
 absent of african polysyllables, dry husk, consonants there
 now, in their place, names, flat, as polluted rivers
 & that guitar string smile always snaking across
 some virulent, american, redneck’s face
 scorching, like atomic heat, mushrooming over nagasaki
 & hiroshima, the fever blistered shadows of it all
 inked, as etchings, into sizzled concrete
 but you, there, father, through it all, a yardbird solo
 riffing on bat & ball glory, breaking down the fabricated myths
 of white major league legends, of who was better than who
 beating them at their own crap
 game, with killer bats, as bud powell swung his silence into beauty
 of a josh gibson home run, skittering across piano keys of bleachers
 shattering all manufactured legends up there in lights
 struck out white knights, on the risky edge of amazement
 awe, the miraculous truth sluicing through
 steeped & disguised in the blues
 confluencing, like the point at the cross
 when a fastball hides itself up in a slider, curve
 breaking down & away in a wicked, sly grin
 curved & posed as an ass-scratching uncle tom, who
 like old sachel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch
 before coming back with a hard, high, fast one, is slicker
 sliding, & quicker than a professional hitman—
 the deadliness of it all, the sudden strike
 like that of the “brown bomber’s” crossing right
 of sugar ray robinson’s, lightning, cobra bite
  
 & you, there, father, through it all, catching rhythms
 of chono pozo balls, drumming, like conga beats into your catcher’s mitt
 hard & fast as “cool papa” bell jumping into bed
 before the lights went out
  
 of the old, negro baseball league, a promise, you were
 father, a harbinger, of shock waves, soon come

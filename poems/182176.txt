title : Go Ahead, Seaver

author : Phil Rizzuto

text : 
You know, 
Some kid wrote me a letter. 
You and Murcer, 
I know, 
Every time Murcer says 
I make oh for four and two errors. 
Some guy wrote, 
Which I haven’t gotten yet, 
He wrote it to Yankee Stadium, 
But by the way, 
You’re doing the play-by-play, Seaver. 
So go ahead. 
I was gonna tell you something, 
But I forgot what it was. 
Go ahead.

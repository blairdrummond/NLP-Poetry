title : Failures in Infinitives

author : Bernadette Mayer

text : 
why am i doing this? Failure 
to keep my work in order so as 
to be able to find things 
to paint the house 
to earn enough money to live on 
to reorganize the house so as 
to be able to paint the house & 
to be able to find things and 
earn enough money so as 
to be able to put books together 
to publish works and books 
to have time 
to answer mail & phone calls 
to wash the windows 
to make the kitchen better to work in 
to have the money to buy a simple radio 
to listen to while working in the kitchen 
to know enough to do grownups work in the world 
to transcend my attitude 
to an enforced poverty 
to be able to expect my checks 
to arrive on time in the mail 
to not always expect that they will not 
to forget my mother's attitudes on humility or 
to continue 
to assume them without suffering 
to forget how my mother taunted my father 
about money, my sister about i cant say it 
failure to forget mother and father enough 
to be older, to forget them 
to forget my obsessive uncle 
to remember them some other way 
to remember their bigotry accurately 
to cease to dream about lions which always is 
to dream about them, I put my hand in the lion's mouth 
to assuage its anger, this is not a failure 
to notice that's how they were; failure 
to repot the plants 
to be neat 
to create & maintain clear surfaces 
to let a couch or a chair be a place for sitting down 
and not a table 
to let a table be a place for eating & not a desk 
to listen to more popular music 
to learn the lyrics 
to not need money so as 
to be able to write all the time 
to not have to pay rent, con ed or telephone bills 
to forget parents' and uncle's early deaths so as 
to be free of expecting care; failure 
to love objects 
to find them valuable in any way; failure 
to preserve objects 
to buy them and 
to now let them fall by the wayside; failure 
to think of poems as objects 
to think of the body as an object; failure 
to believe; failure 
to know nothing; failure 
to know everything; failure 
to remember how to spell failure; failure 
to believe the dictionary & that there is anything 
to teach; failure 
to teach properly; failure 
to believe in teaching 
to just think that everybody knows everything 
which is not my failure; I know everyone does; failure 
to see not everyone believes this knowing and 
to think we cannot last till the success of knowing 
to wash all the dishes only takes ten minutes 
to write a thousand poems in an hour 
to do an epic, open the unwashed window 
to let in you know who and 
to spirit thoughts and poems away from concerns 
to just let us know, we will 
to paint your ceilings & walls for free

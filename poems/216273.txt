title : Before the Rain

author : Lianne Spidel

text : 
Minutes before the rain begins
 I always waken, listening
 to the world hold its breath,
 as if a phone had rung once in a far
 room or a door had creaked
 in the darkness.

 Perhaps the genes of some forebear
 startle in me, some tribal warrior
 keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,
 miserable in the cold,

 though I think it is a woman's waiting
 I have come to know,
 a Loyalist hiding in the woods,
 muffling the coughing of her child
 against her linen skirts, her dark head
 bent over his, her fear spent
 somewhere else in time,

 leaving only this waiting,

 and I hope she escaped
 with her child, and I suppose she did.
 If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake,
 alive, listening for the rain to begin
 so that she can run, the sound
 of her footsteps lost, the sight
 of them blotted away on the path.

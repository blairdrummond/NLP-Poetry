How were we to know, leaving your two kids 
behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon 
at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap 
hotels in New York City to draw customers 
like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby? 
Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found 
a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door 
with a cut on one side the exact shape 
of the toilet bowl that was in its way 
when I closed it. I opened and shut the door, 
admiring the fit and despairing of it. You 
discovered the initials of lovers carved 
on the bureau’s top in a zigzag, breaking heart. 
How wrong the place was to us then, 
unable to see the portents of our future 
that seem so clear now in the naiveté 
of the arrangements we made, the hotel’s 
disdain for those with little money, 
the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room 
we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay 
our love down, and in this way began our unwise 
and persistent and lucky life together.

text : 
In speaking of ‘aspiration,’
   From the recesses of a pen more dolorous than blackness         
       itself,
      Were you presenting us with one more form of imperturbable 
          French drollery,
      Or was it self directed banter?
         Habitual ennui
            Took from you, your invisible, hot helmet of anaemia—
      While you were filling your “little glass” from the 
               decanter
            Of a transparent-murky, would-be-truthful “hobohemia”—
         And then facetiously
      Went off with it?   Your soul’s supplanter,
   The spirit of good narrative, flatters you, convinced that 
            in reporting briefly
 One choice incident, you have known beauty other than that      
          of stys, on 
Which to fix your admiration.

                So far as the future is concerned,
 “Shall not one say, with the Russian philosopher,
    ‘How is one to know what one doesn’t know?’”
                So far as the present is concerned,

If external action is effete
    And rhyme is outmoded,
       I shall revert to you,
    Habakkuk, as on a recent occasion I was goaded
         Into doing, by XY, who was speaking of unrhymed                      
                  verse.
This man said—I think that I repeat
   His identical words:
      “Hebrew poetry is
   Prose with a sort of heightened consciousness.   ‘Ecstacy 
                affords
         The occasion and expediency determines the form.’”

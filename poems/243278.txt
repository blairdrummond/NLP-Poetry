I
  
 Imperia
  
 I saw a plaster hand, on view
 In sculptor’s studio, set apart...
 Aspasia’s? Cleopatra’s?... Who?
 This fragment’s human work of art?
  
 Like lily silvered by the dawn,
 Frozen in kiss of snow, its light
 Loveliness dazzled me, and shone
 In poetry of purest white.
  
 Though pallid, wan, yet striking, it
 Spread over velvet, graceful, slender
 Fingers—delicate, exquisite—
 Decked thick with rings of weighty splendor.
  
 Thumb high, in serpentine-like pose,
 Arched in a svelte and shapely line,
 It lay, fine set, like one of those
 Hands held with proud air Florentine.
  
 Did it comb out the sultan’s beard
 On jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls
 And twistings, when Don Juan appeared,
 Play in his lustrous, glistening curls?
  
 A courtesan’s? A queen’s? Did this
 Wrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?
 The paragon of fleshly bliss?
 Sovereignty’s beauteous paragon?
  
 Doubtless, by little starts and fits,
 It lit, poised, in its fluttering,
 On the she-lion croup of its
 Chimera-dream, caught on the wing;
  
 The Empire’s fantasies; bombastic
 Love of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;
 Voluptuous frenzies orgiastic;
 Impossible and futile dreams;
  
 Wild tales; poetic escapades
 Of hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;
 Dashing Bohemian cavalcades
 On steeds unbridled, coursing free...
  
 Such are the things the eyes divines
 In that white book, by Venus written:
 Blank palm where she has traced the signs
 One reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten.
  
  
 II
  
 Lacenaire
  
 Close by, in contrast, lying there,
 Encushioned, was the severed hand—
 Pungent-embalmed—of Lacenaire,
 Assassin and scourge of the land;
  
 Curio most depraved! But, though
 Repulsed, I reached and touched it, still
 Barely cleansed of its horrors! Oh!
 That flesh, red-downed and deathly chill!
  
 Sallow hand, like a mummy’s wrought,
 All yellowed, laid-out pharaoh-wise,
 Spreading its faun-like fingers, taut,
 As if to seize its tempting prize;
  
 Exuding from their tips, an itching
 Lusting for living flesh and gold,
 About to writhe, convulsed, and twitching
 Before their victims, as of old.
  
 Vice clawed vile hieroglyph designs
 Of heinous wrongs—most foul, most fell—
 In all its wrinkles, all its lines,
 Signs that the executioner knew well!
  
 One see its scabrous deeds large writ
 In the palm’s bestial creases, and
 The boiling cauldron scalding it
 With every crime at sin’s command;
  
 Capri’s debauches libertine,
 Of fleshpot brothels orgy-rife
 Stained through with blot of blood and wine
 Like the old Caesar’s blasé life.
  
 At once both soft and savage, its
 Shape shows a curious elegance,
 A fearsome grace that counterfeits
 The gladiator’s graceful stance!
  
 Crime’s aristocracy! No plane,
 No hammer’s labors ever made
 Its flesh tough time and time again!
 Its only tool, the dagger-blade...
  
 Work’s honest calluses! For you
 We look in vain, no sign we see:
 Evil’s false poet, butcher true—
 A Manfred of the gutter, he!

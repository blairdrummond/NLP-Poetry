I saw the hand of Rasputin 
cast in bronze and used as an oversized 
paperweight on someone’s desk. 
The authentic hand. Smooth as Italian leather. 
It was molded from plaster before he was killed. 
Bought at an auction in Europe. 
She was a collector. 
She knew the value of everything. 

I wouldn’t like Rasputin’s hand 
on my desk, even though it wore the skin 
over its fine bones like a soft glove 
and healed the tsarevitch. 
I wouldn’t like her Samurai sword. 
I’m glad I don’t know what I’m worth. 

There are days when the whole world 
feels like somebody else’s collection. 
Even your hands. We walk 
in another country and the mist 
slowly rises above the lake 
like the heaviness we left, 
dissolving. 
Only it’s not our heaviness. 

* 

Sometimes, waking, I forget 
where I am. The things around me 
go on with their old existence 
like props in a play, as if the curtain 
has just risen on a room in an Italian villa. 
It’s not my play. 

In the old life there was a photo 
of Valentino on my desk. 
Agnes Ayers was swooning in his arms, 
the Sheik in a rapture of lips 
without any words. 

Benevolent uncles spoke in a language. 
I didn’t know, their fleshy hands, 
their anxious eyes smiling 
as they patted me gently on the head. 
Like watching a silent movie, 
when they opened their mouths 
like fish under water 
I turned off the sound. 

All that sweet absence. 

* 

Once I learned the thirteen principles 
of Rabbi Salanter, but I remember 
only seven: truth, diligence, honor, 
repose, cleanliness, frugality, 
and silence. If I collected words 
they would have to belong, 
like moss or fleas. Things you say 
that I can believe in. 

Honor reminds me too much of the Samurai. 
I like repose. It belongs to this landscape 
where even the lizards rest 
when we stand still 
and look at the wall together. 

Naming the things of this world 
you begin to own them. 
Cyclamen. Mustard. 
I can’t manage so many flowers. 
But I already know the word for lake in Italian. 

* 

Gulls wheel over Lago di Como 
at sundown on their way south 
trying to catch the last warm currents. 
Their wings are white, then silver, and then smoke 
when the light abandons them 
and dusk settles in their feathers. 

If you don’t collect things, 
it’s easier to move. Easier to stand 
on this cliff for another minute 
and watch the leaves fall, one by one, 
yellow, into the lake. 
They belong to the air 
for the time they are drifting. 
It’s a long way down.

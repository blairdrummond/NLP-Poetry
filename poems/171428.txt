... a separation from the world, a penetration to some source of power and a life-enhancing return ... 
Van Gennep: Rites de Passage 
Moth-force a small town always has,   

          Given the night. 

                                           What field-forms can be, 
         Outlying the small civic light-decisions over 
               A man walking near home? 
                                                         Men are not where he is   
      Exactly now, but they are around him    around him like the strength 

Of fields.    The solar system floats on 
    Above him in town-moths. 
                                             Tell me, train-sound, 
    With all your long-lost grief, 
                                             what I can give.   
    Dear Lord of all the fields 
                                             what am I going to do? 
                                        Street-lights, blue-force and frail 
As the homes of men, tell me how to do it    how 
    To withdraw    how to penetrate and find the source   
      Of the power you always had 
                                             light as a moth, and rising 
       With the level and moonlit expansion 
    Of the fields around, and the sleep of hoping men. 

       You?    I?    What difference is there?    We can all be saved 

       By a secret blooming. Now as I walk 
The night    and you walk with me    we know simplicity   
   Is close to the source that sleeping men 
       Search for in their home-deep beds. 
       We know that the sun is away    we know that the sun can be conquered   
   By moths, in blue home-town air. 
          The stars splinter, pointed and wild. The dead lie under 
The pastures.    They look on and help.    Tell me, freight-train, 
                            When there is no one else 
   To hear. Tell me in a voice the sea 
         Would have, if it had not a better one: as it lifts, 
          Hundreds of miles away, its fumbling, deep-structured roar 
               Like the profound, unstoppable craving 
            Of nations for their wish. 
                                                      Hunger, time and the moon: 

         The moon lying on the brain 
                                                    as on the excited sea    as on 
          The strength of fields. Lord, let me shake   
         With purpose.    Wild hope can always spring   
         From tended strength.    Everything is in that. 
            That and nothing but kindness.    More kindness, dear Lord 
Of the renewing green.    That is where it all has to start: 
         With the simplest things. More kindness will do nothing less 
             Than save every sleeping one 
             And night-walking one 

         Of us. 
                   My life belongs to the world. I will do what I can.

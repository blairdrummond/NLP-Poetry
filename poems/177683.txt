title : Working Outside at Night

author : Denis Johnson

text : 
The moon swells 
and its yellow darkens   
nearer the horizon 
and soon all 
the aluminum rooftops 

shall appear, orange   
and distinct beside   
the orange sun,   
while the diamond   
flares in its vacuum 

within. It is simple 
to be with the shovel,   
thoughtless, inhabited   
by this divorce, 
it is good 

the luminous 
machinery, silenced,   
waits, nice 
that the conveyor 
belts choked with sand 

convey nothing. 
When I return home to   
coffee at 
7:45 the lithe 
young girls will be going   
to high school, pulling 

to their mouths stark 
cigarettes through 
Arizona’s sunlight. 
These last few months 
have been awful, and when 

around five the roosters   
alone on neighboring   
small farms begin 
to scream like humans   
my heart just lies down,   
a stone.

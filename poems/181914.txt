title : [In the Empire of Light]

author : Michael Palmer

text : 
In the Empire of Light 
the waterâ€™s completely dry 

floating on a surface of itself 
around islands pointed south-southwest 

The wind fills it then 
with more of itself 

according to the rules 
which cause parallel lines 

to vibrate and cross 
less and less 

among the hanging baskets from a rain forest 
among the visiting statesmen 

from a rain forest 
Here the dancer stops 

to regain her balance 
and reelaborate the distance 

from the feet to the head 
The risk is a part of the rhythm 

She steps out of 
and into balance 

with those who are left 
Chalk-marks show them where to stand

Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

Just think! some night the stars will gleam 
   Upon a cold, grey stone, 
And trace a name with silver beam, 
   And lo! 'twill be your own. 

That night is speeding on to greet 
   Your epitaphic rhyme. 
Your life is but a little beat 
   Within the heart of Time. 

A little gain, a little pain, 
   A laugh, lest you may moan; 
A little blame, a little fame, 
   A star-gleam on a stone.

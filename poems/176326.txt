title : "Hush little baby, don't say a word,"

author : Mother Goose

text : 
Hush little baby, don't say a word, 
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird. 

And if that mockingbird won't sing, 
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring. 

And if that diamond ring turns to brass, 
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass. 

And if that looking glass gets broke, 
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat. 

And if that billy goat won't pull, 
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull. 

And if that cart and bull turn over, 
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover. 

And if that dog named Rover won't bark, 
Papa's gonna buy you a horse and cart. 

And if that horse and cart fall down, 
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town!

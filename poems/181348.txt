title : Hunting, Hazards, and Holiness

Now they to their slogged forthwendings tend, 
four hunters, guns askew like four unruly hairs, 
to start the rabbit or pheasant from hiding. 
But these cocks, wily, lie close and spy from 
covert or culvert the passing grim party 
and the rabbit keeps Viet-Cong-like to its digs. 
Here is no hunting horn and gargle of hounds 
among horse whinny and hoof stamp and ladies 
in smart hunting habits, though these four 
sport red in patterns motley or checkered and 
in hues fluorescent as road crewmen’s vests. 
Small wonder the game is not game, 
so uncouthly strikes the eye this drawling 
troupe of unshaven hope and choler and color. 

The roadside sparrows, come to dust, scatter 
before the headlong hum of him leather-crouched, 
helmet-missled over the speed-stretched oval 
wheels of his hundred-mile-per-hour crotch rocket 
all the way to Lone Tree past the six-foot 
Iowa corn, surprised cows and hogs and the high 
horse considering gravely over the fence this 
black burst of boots and gloves and goggles. 
So the goggle-eyed frog dives under a 
scum of ditch-vetched water fern and the 
blue-backed kestrel stoops from its crystal 
insulator perch and, gray as a piece of the 
paving, up springs the four-inch grasshopper 
splat! like a nicotine bullet in the teeth. 

Bearded buggy dads on their way to market, 
fine trotters high-stepping between shafts, 
broad-brim-hatted, blue-chambray-shirted, 
with black pants and black suspenders, sons 
like scrubbed minor replicas, dutiful 
daughters, eyes downcast among chatter 
of bonneted grannies and mothers, patriarchal 
grandfathers observing that rain must come 
as it always has, God’s will be done, and   
brief gossip also among the elders of shunning 
a deacon caught in unnatural circumstances 
with a pig—the Devil’s own vessel!—and of 
Sister Sara, who’s soon to require the midwife, 
as the moon too is full almost.

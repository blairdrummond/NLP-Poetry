title : My Life’s Delight

author : Thomas Campion

text : 
Come, O come, my life’s delight,
   Let me not in languor pine!
Love loves no delay; thy sight,
   The more enjoyed, the more divine:
O come, and take from me
The pain of being deprived of thee!

Thou all sweetness dost enclose,
   Like a little world of bliss.
Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
   In them pure and eternal is.
Come, then, and make thy flight
As swift to me, as heavenly light.

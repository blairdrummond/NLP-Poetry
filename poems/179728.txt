I suppose so. 
I was living in an attic in Philadelphia 
It became very hot in the summer and so I stayed in the 
bars. I didn’t have any money and so with what was almost left 
I put a small ad in the paper and said I was a writer 
looking for work . . . 
which was a god damned lie; I was a writer 
looking for a little time and a little food and some 
attic rent. 
a couple days later when I finally came home 
from somewhere 
the landlady said, there was somebody looking for 
you. and I said, 
there must be some mistake. she said, 
no, it was a writer and he said he wanted you to help him write 
a history book. 
oh, fine, I said, and I knew with that I had another week’s 
rent—I mean, on the cuff— 
so I sat around drinking wine on credit and watching the hot pigeons 
suffer and fuck on my hot roof. 
I turned the radio on real loud 
drank the wine and wondered how I could make a history book 
interesting but true. 
but the bastard never came back, 
and I had to finally sign on with a railroad track gang 
going West 
and they gave us cans of food but no 
openers 
and we broke the cans against the seats and sides of 
railroad cars a hundred years old with dust 
the food wasn’t cooked and the water tasted like 
candlewick 
and I leaped off into a clump of brush somewhere in 
Texas 
all green with nice-looking houses in the 
distance 
I found a park 
slept all night 
and then they found me and put me in a cell 
and they asked me about murders and 
robberies. 
they wanted to get a lot of stuff off the books 
to prove their efficiency 
but I wasn’t that tired 
and they drove me to the next big town 
fifty-seven miles away 
the big one kicked me in the ass 
and they drove off. 
but I lucked it: 
two weeks later I was sitting in the office of the city hall 
half-asleep in the sun like the big fly on my elbow 
and now and then she took me down to a meeting of the council 
and I listened very gravely as if I knew what was happening 
as if I knew how the funds of a halfass town were being 
dismantled. 
later I went to bed and woke up with teethmarks all over 
me, and I said, Christ, watch it, baby! you might give me 
cancer! and I’m rewriting the history of the Crimean War! 
and they all came to her house— 
all the cowboys, all the cowboys: 
fat, dull and covered with dust. 
and we all shook hands. 
I had on a pair of old bluejeans, and they said 
oh, you’re a writer, eh? 
and I said: well, some think so. 
and some still think so . . . 
others, of course, haven’t quite wised up yet. 
two weeks later they 
ran me out 
of town.

title : All Hallows’ Eve

author : Dorothea Tanning

text : 
Be perfect, make it otherwise.
 Yesterday is torn in shreds.
 Lightning’s thousand sulfur eyes
 Rip apart the breathing beds.
 Hear bones crack and pulverize.
 Doom creeps in on rubber treads.
 Countless overwrought housewives, 
 Minds unraveling like threads,
 Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
 Fears of age and general dreads.
 Sit tight, be perfect, swat the spies,
 Don’t take faucets for fountainheads.
 Drink tasty antidotes. Otherwise
 You and the werewolf: newlyweds.

title : From a Photograph

author : George Oppen

text : 
Her arms around me—child—
Around my head, hugging with her whole arms,
Whole arms as if I were a loved and native rock,
The apple in her hand—her apple and her father, 
                   and my nose pressed
Hugely to the collar of her winter coat—. There 
                   in the photograph

It is the child who is the branch
We fall from, where would be bramble,
Brush, bramble in the young Winter
With its blowing snow she must have thought
Was ours to give to her.

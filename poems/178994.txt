title : The Cab Driver Who Ripped Me Off

text : 
That’s right, said the cab driver, 
Turning the corner to the   
Round-a-bout way, 
Those stupid, fuckin’ beggars,   
You know the guys who   
Walk up to my cab 
With their hands extended   
And their little cups?   
You know their problem? 
You know what’s wrong with them? 
They ain’t got no brains. 
I mean, they don’t know nothin’ 
’cause if they had brains   
They’d think of a way   
To find a job. 
You know what one of ’em told me once? 
He said what he did,   
Begging 
He said it was work.   
Begging 
Was work. 
And I told him 
Straight to his face: 
That ain’t work. 
You think that’s work? 
Let me tell you what work is:   
Work is something that you do 
That’s of value 
To someone else. 
Now you take me. 
It takes brains to do 
What I do. 
You know what I think? 
I think they ought to send 
All these beggars over   
To some other country,   
Any country, 
It don’t matter which,   
For 3, 4, years, 
Let them wander around   
Some other country,   
See how they like that.   
We ought to make a   
National program 
Sending them off 
To wander about 
Some other country   
For a few years, 
Let ’em beg over there,   
See how far it gets them.   
I mean, look at that guy   
You know, who was big   
In the sixties, 
That drug guy, 
Timothy Leary? 
Yeah, he went underground,   
Lived overseas. 
You know what? 
A few years abroad 
And he was ready to   
Come back 
On any terms. 
He didn’t care if 
They arrested him. 
He said 
The U.S. is better 
Than any country 
In the world. 
Send them over there   
For a few years. 
They’d be just like him.   
This is the greatest country 
In the whole world.   
Timothy Leary 
Was damn happy 
To get back here, 
And he’s doing fine.   
Look at me. 
I used to be like that. 
I used to live underground. 
I came back. 
I think all those beggars got 
   a mental block. 
I think you should do something. 
I mean, you ought to like   
   what you do, 
But you should do something.   
Something of use 
To the community.   
All those people, 
Those bums, 
Those scam artists,   
Those hustlers, 
Those drug addicts,   
Those welfare cheats,   
Those sponges. 
Other than that 
I don’t hold nothin’   
Against no one. 
Hey, I picked you up.

title : Unused Baby

Unused baby blood and this is 
how you motion with hands 
clotty leaving

   You have your apparatus 
being the Frog Husband and I burn 
your frog skin to keep you 
in the shape I prefer

   Chimes   You wrote in your apple 
box   Elegant neck

   I tried to glue the ripped 
paper back to the religious 
art but it doesn't work

   Making a mess of it

   Wasp friend landed on my 
shoulder sparkle to say     This place
we are in            is a place

             Broil the asparagus

   Frog heart
apparatus

   Wash towels and rags
on Wednesdays

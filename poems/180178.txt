title : Easy as Falling Down Stairs

To always be in motion there is no choice 
even for the mountain and its frigid 
cousins floating on the oceans that even sluggish 
seethe and moan and laugh out loud at their own 
jokes. How "like the human heart" can be said of 
pert near everything, pint of fizz, punching 
bag because all moves: the mouse, the house, 
the pelt of moon corresponding to the seas 
(see above) (now get back here) of mood, 
sadness heaving kelp at the sunken city's 
face, gladness somersaulting from the eaves 
like a kid's drawing of a snowflake. No matter 
how stalled I seem, some crank in me 
tightens the whirly-spring each time I see 
your face so thank you for aiming it 
my way, all this flashing like polished 
brass, lightning, powder, step on the gas, 
whoosh we're halfway through our lives, 
fishmarkets flying by, Connecticut, 
glut then scarcity, hurried haircuts, 
smell of pencils sharpened, striving, 
falling short, surviving because we ducked 
or somehow got some shut-eye even though 
inside the hotel wall loud leaks. I love 
to watch the youthful flush drub your cheeks 
in your galloping dream. Maybe even 
death will be replenishment. Who knows? 
Who has the time, let's go, the unknown's 
display of emeralds closes in an hour, 
the fireworks' formula has changed, will we 
ever see that tangerine blue again, factory 
boarded up then turned into bowling lanes.

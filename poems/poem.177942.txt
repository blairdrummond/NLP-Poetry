Courage, my Soul, now learn to wield 
The weight of thine immortal shield. 
Close on thy head thy helmet bright. 
Balance thy sword against the fight. 
See where an army, strong as fair, 
With silken banners spreads the air. 
Now, if thou be'st that thing divine, 
In this day's combat let it shine: 
And show that Nature wants an art 
To conquer one resolved heart. 

PLEASURE 
Welcome the creation's guest, 
Lord of earth, and heaven's heir. 
Lay aside that warlike crest, 
And of Nature's banquet share: 
Where the souls of fruits and flowers 
Stand prepared to heighten yours. 

SOUL 
I sup above, and cannot stay 
To bait so long upon the way. 

PLEASURE 
On these downy pillows lie, 
Whose soft plumes will thither fly: 
On these roses strewed so plain 
Lest one leaf thy side should strain. 

SOUL 
My gentler rest is on a thought, 
Conscious of doing what I ought. 

PLEASURE 
If thou be'st with perfumes pleased, 
Such as oft the gods appeased, 
Thou in fragrant clouds shalt show 
Like another god below. 

SOUL 
A soul that knows not to presume 
Is heaven's and its own perfume. 

PLEASURE 
Everything does seem to vie 
Which should first attract thine eye: 
But since none deserves that grace, 
In this crystal view thy face. 

SOUL 
When the Creator's skill is prized, 
The rest is all but earth disguised. 

PLEASURE 
Hark how music then prepares 
For thy stay these charming airs; 
Which the posting winds recall, 
And suspend the river's fall. 

SOUL 
Had I but any time to lose, 
On this I would it all dispose. 
Cease, tempter. None can chain a mind 
Whom this sweet chordage cannot bind. 

CHORUS 
Earth cannot show so brave a sight 
As when a single soul does fence 
The batteries of alluring sense, 
And heaven views it with delight. 
   Then persevere: for still new charges sound: 
   And if thou overcom'st, thou shalt be crowned. 

PLEASURE 
All this fair, and soft, and sweet, 
   Which scatteringly doth shine, 
Shall within one beauty meet, 
   And she be only thine. 

SOUL 
If things of sight such heavens be, 
What heavens are those we cannot see? 

PLEASURE 
Wheresoe'er thy foot shall go 
   The minted gold shall lie, 
Till thou purchase all below, 
   And want new worlds to buy. 

SOUL 
Were't not a price, who'd value gold? 
And that's worth naught that can be sold. 

PLEASURE 
Wilt thou all the glory have 
   That war or peace commend? 
Half the world shall be thy slave 
   The other half thy friend. 

SOUL 
What friends, if to my self untrue! 
What slaves, unless I captive you! 

PLEASURE 
Thou shalt know each hidden cause; 
   And see the future time: 
Try what depth the centre draws; 
   And then to heaven climb. 

SOUL 
None thither mounts by the degree 
Of knowledge, but humility. 

CHORUS 
Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul; 
The world has not one pleasure more: 
The rest does lie beyond the Pole, 
And is thine everlasting store.

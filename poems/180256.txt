title : Double Rainbow

author : James Galvin

text : 
Well aren't you the harsh necessity, 
As in what fear is for? 
It was the summer of 
You should have been there, 
Though the last thing I want 
Anywhere near me is you. 
Louche and thaumaturgic, 
You made my faith 
My foolishnessâ€” 
Easy as lying to trees. 
Essence of the inessential 
Is what you are, double rainbow, 
Extrinsic as blood is to stars, 
An empire not of death, 
But inspired by death, 
Farrago of arid precepts, 
A few cheap ideas about hope, 
The eschaton, alterity, 
All featuring you. 
What are the chances? 
Slim to none. 
But listen here, my fraud, my forger, 
I could close my eyes at any time. 
All I have to do is close my eyes.

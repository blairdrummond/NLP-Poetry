title : Love Poem to Be Read to an Illiterate Friend

author : Tess Gallagher

text : 
I have had to write this down
 in my absence and yours. These
 things happen. Thinking
 of a voice added
 I imagine a sympathy outside us
 that protects the message
 from what can’t help,
 being said.
  
 The times you’ve kept
 your secret, putting on
 glasses or glancing into a page
 with interest, give again
 the hurt you’ve forgiven, pretending
 to be one of us.
 So the hope of love
 translates as a series of hidden moments
 where we like to think
 someone was fooled 
 into it.
  
 Who was I then
 who filled these days 
 will illegible warnings: the marriages
 broken, the land
 pillaged by speculators, no word 
 for a stranger?
  
 This island
 where I thought the language was mine
 has left me lonely
 and innocent as you or that friend
 who let you copy his themes
 until the words became pictures
 of places you would never go.
  
 Forgive it then
 that so much of after
 depends on these, the words
 which must find you 
 off the page.

title : The Apparition

author : Herman Melville

text : 
(A Retrospect)
Convulsions came; and, where the field
   Long slept in pastoral green,
A goblin-mountain was upheaved
(Sure the scared sense was all deceived),
Marl-glen and slag-ravine.

The unreserve of Ill was there,
   The clinkers in her last retreat;
But, ere the eye could take it in,
Or mind could comprehension win,
   It sunk!—and at our feet.

So, then, Solidity’s a crust—
   The core of fire below;
all may go well for many a year,
But who can think without a fear
   Of horrors that happen so?

title : Mother's Closet

This is everything she ever closed a door 
on, the broom closet of childhood 
where no one could ever find a broom. 
Here, layer upon layer, nothing breathes: 
photo albums curl at the edges, books 
she brought home from the library 
where she worked, handled by thousands 
of other hands before their final exile 
where they’ve waited, paper and more paper 
taking in the ocean air, about to sprout. 

Mother’s sitting on the bed 
with her tattered list of dispersals—who gets 
what among the treasures she hopes 
I’ll find, but I know I’m seeing 
what she doesn't want me to see, 
the daughter cleaning doing what the son 
would never do. After an hour of excavation 
the console TV emerges from beneath 
forgotten sweaters and balled up nylons 
saved for stuffing puppets, a long ago church project— 
the TV arrived in 1966 same day I crushed 
the fender of the car, upsetting 
the careful plans she’d made for payment. 

She wants to leave so much behind. Hours later 
I’ve found nothing I want but the purple mache mask 
I made in the fourth grade. I like its yellow eyes. 
She looks at each magazine I remove, saving 
every word about my brother, the coach. He’s sixty 
and a long dead mouse has eaten the laces 
of his baby shoes. I want order. I say 
I’m old myself, I’ve started throwing things away. 
I’m lying. I’ve kept everything she’s ever given me.

Autumn 1914
'O England, may God punish thee!' 
-- Is it that Teuton genius flowers 
Only to breathe malignity
 Upon its friend of earlier hours?
-- We have eaten your bread, you have eaten ours, 
We have loved your burgs, your pines' green moan, 
Fair Rhine-stream, and its storied towers; 
Your shining souls of deathless dowers 
Have won us as they were our own: 

We have nursed no dreams to shed your blood, 
We have matched your might not rancorously
 Save a flushed few whose blatant mood 
You heard and marked as well as we 
To tongue not in their country's key; 
But yet you cry with face aflame, 
'O England, may God punish thee!' 
And foul in onward history, 
And present sight, your ancient name.

Sonnet

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead! 
      There's none of these so lonely and poor of old, 
      But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold. 
These laid the world away; poured out the red 
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be 
      Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, 
      That men call age; and those who would have been, 
Their sons, they gave, their immortality. 

Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth, 
      Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain, 
Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, 
      And paid his subjects with a royal wage; 
And Nobleness walks in our ways again; 
      And we have come into our heritage.

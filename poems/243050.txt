I. January 22, 1932
  
 Could a four-year-old look out of a square sedan
 (A Studebaker Six in currency green
 With wooden artillery wheels) and see a scene
 Of snow, light lavender, landing on deepening blue
 Buildings built out of red-violet bricks, and black
 Passersby passing by over the widening white
 Streets darkening blue, under a thickening white
Sky suddenly undergoing sheer twilight,
 And the yellow but whitening streetlights coming on,
 And remember it now, though the likelihood is gone
 That it ever happened at all, and the Village is gone
 That it ever could happen in? Memory, guttering out,
 Apparently, finally flares up and banishes doubt.

 Tring. Bells
 On grocers’ boys’ bicycles ring,
 Followed, on cue,
 By the jaunty one-note of prayers at two
 Near churches; taxi horns, a-hunt,
 Come in for treble; next, the tickety bass
 Of chain-driven Diamond T’s, gone elephantine
 And stove-enamelled conifer green
 Down Greenwich Avenue.
 Out of the Earle
 I issue at half-past thirteen,
 Struck, like a floral clock, 
 By seasonal
 Manifestations: unreasonable
 N.Y.U. girls out in their bobby socks
 And rayon blouses; meek boys with their books
 Who have already moulted mackinaws;
 Desarrolimiento of 
 New chrome-green leaves; a rose,
 Got, blooming, out of bed; and Mrs. Roos-
 Evelt and Sarah Delano
 Descending the front stoop of a Jamesian
 House facing south against the Square, the sun—
 Who, curveting, his half course not yet run,
 Infects the earth with crescence;
 And the presence 
 Of process, seen in un-top-hatted,
 Un-frock-coated burghers and their sons
 And daughters, taking over
 All title, right, and interest soever
 In this, now their
 Property, Washington Square.

 The Hotel Storia ascends
 Above me and my new wife; ends
 Eight stories of decline, despair,
 Iron beds and hand-washed underwear
 Above us and our leatherette
 Chattels, still grounded on the wet
 Grey tessellated lobby floor.
 Soon, through a dingy, numbered door,
 We’ll enter into our new home,
 Provincials in Imperial Rome
 To seek their fortune, or, at least,
 To find a job. The wedding feast,
 Digested and metabolized,
 Diminishes in idealized
 Group photographs, and hard today
 Shunts us together and at bay.
 Outside the soot-webbed window, sleet
 Scourges the vista of Eighth Street;
 Inside, the radiators clack
 And talk and tell us to go back
 Where we came from. A lone pecan
 Falls from our lunch, a sticky bun,
 And bounces on the trampoline
 Of the torn bedspread. In the mean
 Distance of winter, a man sighs,
 A bedstead creaks, a woman cries.
  
  
 IV. July 14, 1951
  
 A summer lull arrives in the West Village,
 Transmuting houses into silent salvage
 Of the last century, streets into wreckage
 Uncalled-for by do-gooders who police
 The moderniqueness of our ways, patrol
 The sanitation of the urban soul.
 What I mean is, devoid of people, all
 Our dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude,
 Fur over with untenancy, glaze grey
 With summer’s dust and incivility,
 With lack of language and engagement, while
 Their occupants sport, mutate, and transform
 Themselves, play at dissembling the god Norm
 From forward bases at Fire Island. But—
 Exception proving rules, dissolving doubt—
 Young Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,
 My daylong colleague in the corridors
 Of Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,
 Is at home to the residue in his
 Acute apartment in an angle of 
 Abingdon Square. And they’re all there, the rear-
 Guard of the garrison of Fort New York:
 The skeleton defense of skinny girls
 Who tap the typewriters of summertime;
 The pale male workers who know no time off
 Because too recently employed; the old
 Manhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;
 The writers (Walker’s one), who see in their
 City as desert an oasis of
 Silence and time to execute their plots
 Against the state of things, but fall a prey
 To day succeeding day alone, and call
 A party to restore themselves to all
 The inside jokes of winter, in whose caul
 People click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,
 Insensible, into odd pockets. Dense
 As gander-feather winter snow, intense
 As inextinguishable summer sun
 At five o’clock (which it now is), the noise
 Of Walker’s congeries of girls and boys 
 Foregathered in their gabbling gratitude
 Strikes down the stairwell from the altitude
 Of his wide-open walk-up, beckoning
 Me, solo, wife gone north, to sickening
 Top-story heat and talk jackhammering
 Upon the anvils of all ears. “Christ, Lou, you’re here,”
 Whoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar
 (“Crabapple,” says the label, still stuck on)
 With gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke
 That seeks its level in my unexplored
 Interior, and sends back a sonar ping
 To echo in my head. Two more blue gins.
 The sweat that mists my glasses interdicts
 My sizing up my interlocutor,
 Who is, I think, the girl who lives next door,
 A long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform
 Girl cellist propped on an improbably
 Slim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.
 The room swings in its gimbals. In the bath
 Is silence, blessed, relative, untorn
 By the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,
 A clear and present invitation. Like
 A climber conquering K.28,
 I clamber over the white porcelain
 Rock face, through whitish veils of rubberized
 Shower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline
 In the encaustic crater, where a fine
 Thread of cold water irrigates my feet,
 To sleep, perchance to dream of winter in
 The Village, fat with its full complement
 Of refugees returned to their own turf—
 Unspringy as it is—in a strong surf
 Of retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed
 On the unlovely birthplace of their mixed
 Emotions, marriages, media, and met-
 Aphors. Lord God of hosts, be with them yet.

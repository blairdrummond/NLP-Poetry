title : That Child

That child was dangerous. That just-born 
    Newly washed and silent baby 
         Wrapped in deerskin and held warm 
Against the side of its mother could understand 
    The language of birds and animals 
         Even when asleep. It knew why Bluejay 
Was scolding the bushes, what Hawk was explaining 
   To the wind on the cliffside, what Bittern had found out 
         While standing alone in marsh grass. It knew 
What the screams of Fox and the whistling of Otter 
    Were telling the forest. That child knew 
         The language of Fire 
As it gnawed at sticks like Beaver 
    And what Water said all day and all night 
         At the creek's mouth. As its small fingers 
Closed around Stone, it held what Stone was saying. 
    It knew what Bear Mother whispered to herself 
         Under the snow. It could not tell 
Anyone what it knew. It would laugh 
    Or cry out or startle or suddenly stare 
         At nothing, but had no way 
To repeat what it was hearing, what it wanted most 
    Not to remember. It had no way to know 
         Why it would fall under a spell 
And lie still as if not breathing, 
    Having grown afraid 
         Of what it could understand. That child would learn 
To sit and crawl and stand and begin 
    Putting one foot forward and following it 
         With the other, would learn to put one word 
It could barely remember slightly ahead 
    Of the other and then walk and speak 
         And finally run and chatter, 
And all the Tillamook would know that child 
    Had forgotten everything and at last could listen 
         Only to people and was safe now.

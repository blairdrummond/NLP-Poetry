title : On Swearing

author : Gary Dop

text : 
In Normandy, at Point Du Hoc,   
where some Rangers died,   
Dad pointed to an old man   
20 feet closer to the edge than us,   
asking if I could see   
the medal the man held   
like a rosary.   
As we approached the cliff   
the man’s swearing, each bulleted   
syllable, sifted back   
toward us in the ocean wind.   
I turned away,   
but my shoulder was held still   
by my father’s hand,   
and I looked up at him   
as he looked at the man.

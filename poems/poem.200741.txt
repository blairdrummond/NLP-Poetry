Blank Verse, Persona

It sat between my husband and my children.   
A place was set for it--a plate of greens.   
It had been there: I had seen it 
But not somehow--but this was like a dream-- 
Not seen it so that I knew I saw it. 
It was as if I could not know I saw it 
Because I had never once in all my life 
Not seen it. It was an eland. 
An eland! That is why the children 
Would ask my husband, for a joke, at Christmas:   
"Father, is it Donner?" He would say, "No, Blitzen."   
It had been there always. Now we put silver   
At its place at meals, fed it the same food   
We ourselves ate, and said nothing. Many times   
When it breathed heavily (when it had tried   
A long useless time to speak) and reached to me   
So that I touched it--of a different size   
And order of being, like the live hard side   
Of a horse's neck when you pat the horse-- 
And looked with its great melting tearless eyes   
Fringed with a few coarse wire-like lashes   
Into my eyes, and whispered to me 
So that my eyes turned backward in their sockets   
And they said nothing-- 
                                 many times   
I have known, when they said nothing,   
That it did not exist. If they had heard 
They could not have been silent. And yet they heard;   
Heard many times what I have spoken 
When it could no longer speak, but only breathe-- 
When I could no longer speak, but only breathe.   

And, after some years, the others came 
And took it from me--it was ill, they told me-- 
And cured it, they wrote me: my whole city 
Sent me cards lilac-branches, mourning 
As I had mourned-- 
                         and I was standing 
By a grave in flowers, by dyed rolls of turf, 
And a canvas marquee the last brown of earth.   

It is over.          
It is over so long that I begin to think 
That it did not exist, that I have never-- 
And my son says, one morning, from the paper: 
"An eland. Look, an eland!"   
                                        --It was so. 

Today, in a German dictionary, I saw elend

title : Falling Leaves and Early Snow

author : Kenneth Rexroth

text : 
In the years to come they will say, 
 “They fell like the leaves
 In the autumn of nineteen thirty-nine.”
 November has come to the forest,
 To the meadows where we picked the cyclamen.
 The year fades with the white frost
 On the brown sedge in the hazy meadows,
 Where the deer tracks were black in the morning.
 Ice forms in the shadows;
 Disheveled maples hang over the water;
 Deep gold sunlight glistens on the shrunken stream.
 Somnolent trout move through pillars of brown and gold.
 The yellow maple leaves eddy above them,
 The glittering leaves of the cottonwood,
 The olive, velvety alder leaves,
 The scarlet dogwood leaves,
 Most poignant of all.
  
 In the afternoon thin blades of cloud
 Move over the mountains;
 The storm clouds follow them;
 Fine rain falls without wind.
 The forest is filled with wet resonant silence.
 When the rain pauses the clouds
 Cling to the cliffs and the waterfalls.
 In the evening the wind changes;
 Snow falls in the sunset.
 We stand in the snowy twilight
 And watch the moon rise in a breach of cloud.
 Between the black pines lie narrow bands of moonlight,
 Glimmering with floating snow.
 An owl cries in the sifting darkness.
 The moon has a sheen like a glacier.

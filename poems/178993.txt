New York grows   
Slimmer 
In his absence.   
I suppose 

You could also title this picture   
Of Miles, his leathery 
Squint, the grace 
In his fingers a sliver of the stuff 

You can’t get anymore, 
As the rest of us wonder:   
What was the name 
Of the driver 

Of that truck? And the rest 
Of us sigh: 
Death is one hell   
Of a pickpocket.

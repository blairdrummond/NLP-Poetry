title : Frequency Modulation

author : Raymond McDaniel

text : 
you are listening to

the transmission via seed pearl, aural irritant

clockwork and sparkgap ultra high and superlow

precious black opal crystal and glass shudders and sings

broad cast scattered the seeds among the apocrypha

each agent at land or sea satellite or space

direct conversion of royal register and groove

high in fidelity to

our regenerative radio hisses and shouts

everything that cannot be owned belongs now to us

irradiant waves oscillate below visible light

to arrive and reside requires no medium but occupies vacuum

and air transformational emission

follow your radiotelegraph

we are your conductor our amplitude varies

we fluctuate the frequency

we are not subject to static interference

we embed the subcarrier

hush yâ€™all

you need not know that language if you know this sound

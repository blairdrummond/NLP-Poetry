A Farewell 
Harriet Monroe 
1860-1936

U.S., Midwestern




Good-bye!--no, do not grieve that it is over, 
   The perfect hour; 
That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover, 
   Flits from the flower. 

Grieve not--it is the law. Love will be flying-- 
   Yes, love and all. 
Glad was the living--blessed be the dying. 
   Let the leaves fall.

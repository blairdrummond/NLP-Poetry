title : Lost in Translation

author : Gabriel Gomez

text : 
The kinship with those humans
 who speak directly to me
 is webbed to the ceiling.
 An economy of satellites, a cosmos,
 where revision we think
 comes without the benefit
 of our witness. A peculiar time
 when stars with modest faces 
 sleep in enormity and mirror
 death like a childâ€™s infirmity that
 despite socio-economics
 is still an illness,
 definitive as fading paint
 grossing a distant
 understanding from a stain
 pooled from its center
 resonant of some terrific
 nucleus making sense
 of its own words
 with the strangest electricity.

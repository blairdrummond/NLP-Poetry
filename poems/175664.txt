title : In the Museum at Teheran

author : James Laughlin

text : 
a sentimental curator has placed   
two fragments of bronze Grecian   
    heads together boy 

and girl so that the faces black- 
ened by the three thousand years of   
    desert sand & sun 

seem to be whispering something   
that the Gurgan lion & the wing- 
    ed dog of Azerbaijan 

must not hear but I have heard   
them as I hear you now half way   
    around the world 

so simply & so quietly more like 
a child than like a woman making   
    love say to me in 

that soft lost near and distant voice   
I’m happy now I’m happy oh don’t   
    move don’t go away.

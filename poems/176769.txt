title : An Ode to Ben Jonson

author : Robert Herrick

text : 
Ah Ben! 
                        Say how, or when 
                        Shall we thy guests 
                Meet at those lyric feasts 
                        Made at the Sun, 
                The Dog, the Triple Tun? 
                Where we such clusters had 
         As made us nobly wild, not mad; 
                And yet each verse of thine 
Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine. 

                               My Ben 
                        Or come again, 
                        Or send to us 
                Thy wit's great overplus; 
                        But teach us yet 
                Wisely to husband it; 
                Lest we that talent spend, 
         And having once brought to an end 
                That precious stock, the store 
Of such a wit the world should have no more.

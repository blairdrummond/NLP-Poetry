title : Double

author : Rae Armantrout

text : 
So these are the hills of home. Hazy tiers   
nearly subliminal. To see them is to see   
double, hear bad puns delivered with a wink.   
An untoward familiarity. 

Rising from my sleep, the road is more 
and less the road. Around that bend are pale   
houses, pairs of junipers. Then to look 
reveals no more.

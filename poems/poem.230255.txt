Epigram, Rhymed Stanza

The Whale that wanders round the Pole   
   Is not a table fish. 
You cannot bake or boil him whole,   
   Nor serve him in a dish; 

But you may cut his blubber up 
   And melt it down for oil, 
And so replace the colza bean 
   (A product of the soil). 

These facts should all be noted down   
   And ruminated on, 
By every boy in Oxford town 
   Who wants to be a Don.

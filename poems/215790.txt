The brightly-painted horse 
Had a boy’s face, 
And four small wheels 
Under his feet, 

Plus a long string 
To pull him by this way and that 
Across the floor, 
Should you care to. 

A string in-waiting 
That slipped away 
In many wiles 
From each and every try.

Knock and they’ll answer, 
Mother told me. 

So I climbed four flights of stairs 
And went in unannounced. 

And found a small wooden toy 
For the taking 

In the ensuing emptiness 
And the fading daylight 

That still gives me a shudder 
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.

Where’s the Lost and Found Department, 
And the quiet entry, 
The undeveloped film 
Of the few clear moments 
Of our blurred lives? 

Where’s the drop of blood 
And the teeny nail 
That pricked my finger 
As I bent down to touch the toy 

And caught its eye?

Evening light, 

Make me a Sunday 
Go-to meeting shadow 
For my toy. 

My dearest memories are 
Steep stair-wells 
In dusty buildings 
On dead-end streets, 

Where I talk to the walls 
And closed doors 
As if they understood me.

The wooden toy sitting pretty. 

No, quieter than that. 

Like the sound of eyebrows 
Raised by a villain 
In a silent movie. 

Psst, someone said behind my back.

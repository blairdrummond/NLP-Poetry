I would not have gotten in this boat with you. 
I would not 
except 
where else was there 
at the dockâ€™s end 
to go? 
The water 
was cold. 

I would not have let you row the boat. 
I could see 
what kind of man you were. 
I would not but 
who was there to choose 
between 
you and me? 

I would not have let you throw away the oars. 
I knew what would happen next, 
except 
what else was there to do, 
struggle 
in a boat with a leak 
over cold water?

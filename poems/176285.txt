The ones too broke or wise to get parts 
from a dealer come here where the mud is red   
and eternal. Eight front ends 

are stacked on girders he salvaged too. 
Ask for Bruce, he said on the phone, and doesn’t   
crack a smile when you show up. 
Twenty-four fifty if we find one, sister. 

Bruce, it says on his coveralls, and Bruce 
on the ones his helper wears. The routine’s so good   
they’re keeping it. The taillight you can have. 

Except for the traffic, the wrong parts of Baltimore   
aren’t so bad: each house pulling 
its straightest face, the curbs and stoops 
lined up like a man inverting his pockets 

to show he’s got nothing to hide. Construction   
sites gone aimless and the detours   
feeling more like home. You know 

where to find a cheap lunch. Up front,   
a woman hears the list through twice   
before, as to a sweet and original   
prompting, she picks fried trout. 

Likewise the oyster shucker, pretending   
you’ve asked for a straw with your beer.   
He searches the counter above which reigns 

a picture of Washington Stokes, retired, 
who cleaned fish to order for fifty-nine years.   
A girl on a schedule deserves 
what she gets, and sometimes gets it kindly, earned 

or no. Untouched by heat of sun or city   
police, the fair-haired accommodate best   
by having everything to learn. 

But here comes your beer without a straw, 
as though good nature were common as thirst.   
Here’s Washington Stokes, who would understand   
the strategy that lets the fool go free.

Out of the whim of data,
 Out of binary contests driven and stored,
 By the law of large numbers and subject to that law
 Which in time will correct us like an event,
 And from bounce and toss of things that aren’t even things,
 I’ve determined the trend I call “you” and know you are real,
 Your unwillingness to appear
 In all but the least likely worlds, as in this world
 Here. In spite of excursions, despite my expenditures
 Ever more anxiously matrixed, ever baroque,
 I can prove we have met and I’ve proved we can do it again
 By each error I make where otherwise one couldn’t be
 Because only an actual randomness
 Never admits a mistake. It’s for your sake,
 Then (though the stars get lost from the bottle,
 Though the bottle unwind), if I linger around in the wrong
 Ringing up details, pixel by high bit by bit,
 In hopes of you not as integer but at least as the sum
 Of all my near misses, divisible,
 Once there is time, to an average that poses you perfectly
 Like a surprise, unaccidentally credible
 Perfectly like a surprise. Am I really too patient
 When this is the only program from which you derive?
 Not if you knew how beautiful you will be,
 How important it is your discovery dawn on me,
 How as long as I keep my attention trained
 Then finally the days
 Will bow every morning in your direction
 As they do to the sun that hosannas upon that horizon
 Of which I am witness and not the one farther on:
 Set to let me elect you as if there were no other choice,
 Choice made like temperature, trend I can actually feel

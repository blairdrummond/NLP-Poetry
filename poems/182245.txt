title : Elegy for the Quagga

author : Sarah Lindsay

text : 
Krakatau split with a blinding noise 
and raised from gutted, steaming rock 
a pulverized black sky, over water walls 
that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. 
Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, 
the last known member of Equus quagga, 
the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. 
Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, 
grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, 
had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. 

When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, 
no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds 
pitched by long winds onto newborn fields 
burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle 
flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. 
The fractured island greened and hummed again; 
handsome zebras tossed their heads 
in zoos, on hired safari plains. 
Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? 
Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, 

see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes 
that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? 
A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, 
we mourn what we mourn. 
Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, 
when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, 
no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, 
no one unwittingly busy 
two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, 
no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.

title : Believe, Believe

author : Bob Kaufman

text : 
Believe in this. Young apple seeds,
 In blue skies, radiating young breast,
 Not in blue-suited insects,
 Infesting society’s garments.
  
 Believe in the swinging sounds of jazz,
 Tearing the night into intricate shreds,
 Putting it back together again,
 In cool logical patterns,
 Not in the sick controllers,
 Who created only the Bomb.
  
 Let the voices of dead poets
 Ring louder in your ears
 Than the screechings mouthed
 In mildewed editorials.
 Listen to the music of centuries,
 Rising above the mushroom time.

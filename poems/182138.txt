title : Father, Child, Water

text : 
I lift your body to the boat   
before you drown or choke or slip too far   

beneath.  I didn’t think—just jumped, just did   
what I did like the physics   

that flung you in.  My hands clutch under   
year-old arms, between your life   

jacket and your bobbing frame, pushing you,   
like a fountain cherub, up and out.   

I’m fooled by the warmth pulsing from   
the gash on my thigh, sliced wide and clean   

by an errant screw on the stern.   
No pain.  My legs kick out blood below.   

My arms strain   
against our deaths to hold you up   

as I lift you, crying, reaching, to the boat.

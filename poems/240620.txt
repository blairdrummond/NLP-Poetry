title : (to crave what the light does crave)

author : Kevin Goodan

text : 
to crave what the light does crave
 to shelter, to flee
 to gain desire of every splayed leaf
 to calm cattle, to heat the mare
 to coax dead flies back from slumber
 to turn the gaze of each opened bud
 to ripe the fruit to rot the fruit
 and drive down under the earth
 to lord gentle dust
 to lend a glancing grace to llamas
 to gather dampness from fields
 and divide birds
 and divide the ewes from slaughter
 and raise the corn and bend the wheat
 and drive tractors to ruin
 burnish the fox, brother the hawk
 shed the snake, bloom the weed
 and drive all wind diurnal
 to blanch the fire and clot the cloud
 to husk, to harvest,
 sheave and chaff
 to choose the bird
 and voice the bird
 to sing us, veery, into darkness

Poor Soul


Fly, 
thief; 
thy 
fief- 
dom 
’s torched. 

Come, 
Cur. 
Fetch! 

Get 
your 
scorched 
earth 
worth.


Not Marble


This 
word,   
whis- 
pered, 
shall 
stand, 
and 

the   
Car- 
rar- 
a 
mar- 
ble 
fall. 















My Mistress’ Eyes Are Nothing


Yes, 
Per- 
fes- 
ser, 

snow 
no 
doubt 
out- 
does 

her 
et- 
cet- 
er- 
as. 



Like the Sun


She’s 

not 
some 
flot- 
sam 
si- 
mi- 
les 
from 
Ly- 
ly’s 
Eu- 
phu- 
es.

Lust 
is 
just 
mis- 

er- 
y, 
wor- 
ry 

and 
blame. 
Brand- 
name 

dreck. 
Ecch.

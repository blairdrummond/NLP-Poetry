I could have anything I wanted
 from the maws of the vending machines
 that stood watch over the waiting
 room of my stepfather’s Shell station.
 Larry or Chubbs would fish out keys
 with grimy fingers, swing open
 the face of the machine, reveal its innards
 stacked columns of soda or candy bars.

 Outside the constant ding of the bell
 as cars pulled in for gas, directions,
 air in the tires, a clean windshield,
 drivers impatient for destination,
 and Chubbs or Larry would dash, leave
 me to choose: Planter’s Peanut
 Bar or Nestle’s Crunch, Coke
 or orange or chocolate pop. Grit

 covered that tiny room, layered
 on maps in their laddered racks, dusting
 the globe of the gumball machine,
 sifted over neat rows of motor oil
 in silver cans, smudging the white
 pages of homework I filled with
 painstaking script. I breathed
 the stink of petroleum, kicked

 at the legs of a yellow plastic
 chair with my black and white
 school oxfords, waiting for my stepfather
 who was supposed to watch me till
 my mother got off work. Nine was too
 young, she thought, to stay at home alone.
 But every day he’d disappear, banged-up
 Chevy gone from the lot, the men

 in oil-streaked uniforms shrugging excuses.
 “Anything she wants,” he’d instructed them,
 and I watched the clock as the sky
 darkened and the bright shell glowed
 against night. My new bra was too tight;
 I hugged my three-ring binder to hide my roll
of belly from Larry, from Chubbs, and sucked
the dregs of chocolate pop or lemon-lime.

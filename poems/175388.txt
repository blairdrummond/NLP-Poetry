title : Blind Curse

author : Simon J. Ortiz

text : 
You could drive blind 
for those two seconds 
and they would be forever. 
I think that as a diesel truck 
passes us eight miles east of Mission. 
Churning through the storm, heedless 
of the hill sliding away. 
There isn’t much use to curse but I do. 
Words fly away, tumbling invisibly 
toward the unseen point where 
the prairie and sky meet. 
The road is like that in those seconds, 
nothing but the blind white side 
of creation. 

                   You’re there somewhere, 
a tiny struggling cell. 
You just might be significant 
but you might not be anything. 
Forever is a space of split time 
from which to recover after the mass passes. 
My curse flies out there somewhere, 
and then I send my prayer into the wake 
of the diesel truck headed for Sioux Falls 
one hundred and eighty miles through the storm.

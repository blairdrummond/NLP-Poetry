title : Sickroom

author : Robert Winner

text : 
I try to carry the gravestone 
from the darkness of my mother's sickroom— 
scratches of light around drawn shades— 
outside, the gold and red of autumn.

She is like a queen in exile 
scraping with her nails on silk walls 
her message of anger, her weak 
insatiable demands and regrets.

I want her to grow rosy old
like a maple leaf, ripening,
yielding only to that ice edged wind that must come
and cut her down—like me, like everyone.

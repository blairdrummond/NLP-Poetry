title : Ondine

text : 
At supper time an ondine’s narrow feet 
made dark tracks on the hearth. 
Like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire’s heat,   
but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold.   
The sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor.   
She sat there with a silvered cedar knot 
for a low stool; and I sat opposite, 
my lips and eyelids hot 
in the heat of the fire. Piling on dry bark, 
seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress,   
I felt uneasiness 
as though firm sand had shifted under my feet   
in the wash of a wave. 

I brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat,   
but sat there crying her cold tears, 
her blue lips quivering with cold and grief. 
She blamed me for a thief, 
saying that I had burned a piece of wood 
the tide washed up. And I said, No, 
the tide had washed it out again; and even so, 
a piece of sodden wood was not so rare 
as polished agate stones or ambergris. 

She stood and wrung her hair 
so that the water made a sudden splash 
on the round rug by the door. I saw her go   
across the little footbridge to the beach. 
After, I threw the knot on the hot coals. 
It fell apart and burned with a white flash, 
a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke. 
I beat it out with a poker   
in the soft ash. 

Now I am frightened on the shore at night,   
and all the phosphorescent swells that rise 
come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes   
with a cold firelight in them; 
and crooked driftwood writhes 
in dry sand when I pass. 

Should she return and bring her sisters with her,   
the withdrawing tide 
would leave a long pool in my bed. 
There would be nothing more of me this side   
the melting foamline of the latest wave.

Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

Suppose, my little lady, 
      Your doll should break her head, 
Could you make it whole by crying 
      Till your eyes and nose are red? 
And would n't it be pleasanter 
      To treat it as a joke; 
And say you 're glad "'T was Dolly's 
      And not your head that broke?" 

Suppose you 're dressed for walking, 
      And the rain comes pouring down, 
Will it clear off any sooner 
      Because you scold and frown? 
And would n't it be nicer 
      For you to smile than pout, 
And so make sunshine in the house 
      When there is none without? 

Suppose your task, my little man, 
      Is very hard to get, 
Will it make it any easier 
      For you to sit and fret? 
And would n't it be wiser 
      Than waiting like a dunce, 
To go to work in earnest 
      And learn the thing at once? 

Suppose that some boys have a horse, 
      And some a coach and pair, 
Will it tire you less while walking 
      To say, "It is n't fair?" 
And would n't it be nobler 
      To keep your temper sweet, 
And in your heart be thankful 
      You can walk upon your feet? 

And suppose the world don't please you, 
      Nor the way some people do, 
Do you think the whole creation 
      Will be altered just for you? 
And is n't it, my boy or girl, 
      The wisest, bravest plan, 
Whatever comes, or does n't come, 
      To do the best you can?

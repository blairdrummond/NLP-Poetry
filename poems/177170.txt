      1 
Is this writing mine 
Whose name is this 
Did I underline 
What I was to miss? 

      2 
An upheaval of leaves 
Enlightens the tree 
Rooted it receives   
Gusts on a spree 

      3 
Beauty makes me sad 
Makes me grieve 
I see what I must leave 

      4 
Scaffold, gallows 
Do whose will 
Who hallows wood 
To build, kill 

      5 
Blind man, anvil 
No hammer strikes 
Your eyes are spikes

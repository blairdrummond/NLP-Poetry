I Abide and Abide and Better Abide

Sonnet

I abide and abide and better abide, 
And after the old proverb, the happy day; 
And ever my lady to me doth say, 
"Let me alone and I will provide." 
I abide and abide and tarry the tide, 
And with abiding speed well ye may. 
Thus do I abide I wot alway, 
Nother obtaining nor yet denied. 
Ay me! this long abiding 
Seemeth to me, as who sayeth, 
A prolonging of a dying death, 
Or a refusing of a desir'd thing. 
Much were it better for to be plain 
Than to say "abide" and yet shall not obtain.

She looked nearly the same 
But when I hugged her 
There was substantially more 
To her—no doubt as with me. 
She fibbed as I did at the edge 
Of curb under the streetlight 
As spiders dropped like tiny 
Parachutes—they were difficult 
To see. On the periphery 
Of good luck, I thought, 
Revisiting her quirky habits 
And expressions, what I eventually 
Found so bothersome. Except 
When I glanced at my watch 
I discovered I was trembling 
Like a small-time embezzler. 
I see, she said, you must have 
An appointment. The driveways 
And hedges funneling back 
Into darkness, into someone else's 
Childhood, where speech was 
An obstacle. Wild turkeys 
Approaching across the lawn. 
Oh no, I said, I'm just so pleased 
To see you. But that didn't 
Make sense either. She cocked 
Her head, a woman with grown 
Twins and three conniving husbands. 
Even my toes felt damp. I remember, 
She said, when you'd lay your head 
On my lap, I'd stroke your hair— 
I didn't recall. Though I thought 
That would be a good idea now. 
But I'm married, I said. I own 
My own business. It would have 
Been helpful if I'd planned 
Some banter. I'm a high school 
Principal, she told me, 
I don't put up with horseshit 
From anyone. I brushed the arm 
Of her jacket—she merely stared. 
A door slammed. A grown idiot 
Drooled in an attic somewhere down 
The lane. I had another image 
As well, one that held an odor 
Of patchouli oil. As she stepped 
Forward without caution, placed a hand 
On my neck. Take me, she insisted, 
To those rivets of flame following 
Wire—because this is it, 
You'll never have another 
Hour. I immediately felt 
Calmer...

Astrophil and Stella 2: Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot 
Sir Philip Sidney 
1554-1586
Renaissance
England
Love, Realistic & Complicated



Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot, 
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed: 
   But known worth did in mine of time proceed, 
Till by degrees it had full conquest got. 
I saw, and liked; I liked, but loved not; 
   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed: 
   At length to love's decrees I, forced, agreed, 
Yet with repining at so partial lot. 
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty 
Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite 
I call it praise to suffer tyranny; 
And now employ the remnant of my wit 
   To make myself believe that all is well, 
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.

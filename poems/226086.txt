Little Robin Redbreast 
    Sat upon a tree; 
Up went Pussy-cat, 
    Down went he. 

Down came Pussy-cat, 
    And away Robin ran; 
Says little Robin Redbreast 
    “Catch me if you can.” 

Little Robin Redbreast 
    Hopped upon a wall; 
Pussy-cat jumped after him, 
    And almost got a fall. 

Little Robin chirped and sang, 
    And what did Pussy say? 
Pussy-cat said “Mew,” 
    and Robin flew away.

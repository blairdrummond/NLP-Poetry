RUN AWAY from this sub- 
scriber for the second time 
are TWO NEGROES, viz. SMART, 
an outlandish dark fellow 

with his country marks 
on his temples and bearing 
the remarkable brand of my 
name on his left breast, last 

seen wearing an old ragged 
negro cloth shirt and breeches 
made of fearnought; also DIDO, 
a likely young wench of a yellow 

cast, born in cherrytime in this 
parish, wearing a mixed coloured 
coat with a bundle of clothes, 
mostly blue, under her one good 

arm. Both speak tolerable plain 
English and may insist on being 
called Cuffee and Khasa respect- 
ively. Whoever shall deliver 

the said goods to the gaoler 
in Baton Rouge, or to the Sugar 
House in the parish, shall receive 
all reasonable charges plus 

a genteel reward besides what 
the law allows. In the mean 
time all persons are strictly 
forbid harbouring them, on pain 

of being prosecuted to the utmost 
rigour of the law. Ten guineas 
will be paid to anyone who can 
give intelligence of their being 

harboured, employed, or enter- 
tained by a white person upon 
his sentence; five on conviction 
of a black. All Masters of vessels 

are warned against carrying them 
out of state, as they may claim 
to be free. If any of the above 
Negroes return of their own 

accord, they may still be for- 
given by

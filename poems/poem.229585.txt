When on the Marge of Evening 
Louise Imogen Guiney 
1861-1920




Rhymed Stanza

When on the marge of evening the last blue light is broken, 
And winds of dreamy odour are loosened from afar, 
Or when my lattice opens, before the lark hath spoken, 
On dim laburnum-blossoms, and morning's dying star, 

I think of thee (O mine the more if other eyes be sleeping!), 
Whose greater noonday splendours the many share and see, 
While sacred and for ever, some perfect law is keeping 
The late, the early twilight, alone and sweet for me.

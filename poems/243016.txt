text : 
Seven years old,
 on loan to an uncle
 and a bundle of cash went missing.
 For three days locked in a room, beaten.
 The golden orbs of pennies roasted in an oven
 removed by tongs
 glisten on a child’s skin
 as she screams and screams.
 These round white scars 
 that remain even today
 without pigment
 without the shadow of colour
 with only the ash’s afterglow.

 After telling that story
 you burnt your hand on the iron,
 burnt it yourself,
 your punishment for breaking silence.

 You rushed to the balcony but they pulled you back inside.
 You wanted to spit, to scream insults at the soldiers
 to stop them beating up the old man in the street.
 “Listen,” she said as she held you back, your mother.
 “Listen, you have to learn to say nothing.”
 Learn to be nobody.
 Learn to be the white wall
 that has no face and no tongue.

title : Choice

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
Allegiance is assigned   
Forever when the mind   
Chooses and stamps the will.   
Thus, I must love you still   
Through good and ill. 

But though we cannot part   
We may retract the heart   
And build such privacies   
As self-regard agrees   
Conduce to ease. 

So manners will repair   
The ravage of despair 
Which generous love invites,   
Preferring quiet nights   
To vain delights.

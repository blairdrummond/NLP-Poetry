my pastoral  :

                                            four panels

                                            of perpetual

            man and dog

                             concealed within march grass
                                             wild acre of strong necks
                over there   evening’s plate
                         of dark meat
            synchronized release of feet
                              let me also
            replicate the spring-loaded
                           as my toilette
                                          used against me
                                                 was pin weaponry
                           there is an exercise
            I know by heart (the brain)

                    clench the antlers of a stag

move some air

through my vein

Birdsongs that sound like the steady determined tapping 
of a shoemaker's hammer, 
or of a sculptor making tiny ball-peen dents in a silver plate, 
wake me this morning. Is it possible the world itself can be happy? The calico cat 
stretches her long body out across the top of my computer monitor, 
yawning, its little primitive head a cave of possibility. 
And I'm ready again 
to try and see accidents, the over and over patterns 
of double-slit experiments a billionfold 
repeated before me. If I had great patience, 
I could try to count the poplar, birch and oak 
leaves in their shifting welter outside my bedroom window 
or the almost infinitesimal trails of thought that flash and flash 
everywhere, as if decaying particles inside a bubble chamber,
windshield raindrops, lake ripples. However, 
instead I go to fry some bacon, crack two eggs 
into the cast-iron skillet that's even older than this house, 
and on the calendar (each month another oriental fan 
where the climbing solitary is dwarfed . . . or on dark blue oceans 
minuscular fishing boats bob beneath gigantic waves) 
X out the days, including those I've forgotten.

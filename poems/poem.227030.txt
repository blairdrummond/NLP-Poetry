Chorus 
Ca' the yowes to the knowes, 
Ca' them where the heather grows 
Ca' them where the burnie rows, 
      My bonie dearie. 

Hark! the mavis' evening sang 
Sounding Cluden's woods amang, 
Then a-fauldin let us gang, 
      My bonie dearie. 

We'll gae down by Cluden side, 
Thro' the hazels spreading wide, 
O'er the waves that sweetly glide 
      To the moon sae clearly. 

Yonder Cluden's silent towers, 
Where at moonshine midnight hours, 
O'er the dewy-bending flowers, 
      Fairies dance sae cheery. 

Ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear; 
Thou 'rt to love and Heaven sae dear, 
Nocht of ill may come thee near, 
      My bonie dearie. 

Fair and lovely as thou art, 
Thou hast stown my very heart; 
I can die--but canna part, 
      My bonie dearie.

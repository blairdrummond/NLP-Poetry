I cannot know twisted Henriette of the plant kingdom
 Engrafted with a crutch. And yet her bulbous concerns
 Effuse a solid blue from inside,
 Like a steel Dryad, and her gaze effaced
  
 Shines with distended power. Otherwise
 These clusterjewels would not dazzle us so,
 As limbs proliferate through her pulped brain
 From dendrites where creation flared
  
 And this crippled tree would seem defaced,
 J’Accuse! beneath the lace of this clipped sister
 And would not glisten in synaptic blasts
  
 Would not, from all the reaching boughs of self,
 Burst like ripe sapphires: for here there is no place
 That does not see you. You shake forth a nest.

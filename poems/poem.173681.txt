Living, Death

Rhymed Stanza

When I watch the living meet, 
      And the moving pageant file 
Warm and breathing through the street 
      Where I lodge a little while, 

If the heats of hate and lust 
      In the house of flesh are strong, 
Let me mind the house of dust 
      Where my sojourn shall be long. 

In the nation that is not 
      Nothing stands that stood before; 
There revenges are forgot, 
      And the hater hates no more; 

Lovers lying two and two 
      Ask not whom they sleep beside, 
And the bridegroom all night through 
      Never turns him to the bride.

 Nowhere is all around us, pressureless,
 A vacuum waiting for a rupture in
 The tegument, a puncture in the skin,
 To pass inside without a password and
 Implode us into Erewhon. This room
 Is dangerously unguarded: in one wall
 An empty elevator clangs its doors,
 Imperiously, for fodder; in the hall,
 Bare stretchers gape for commerce; in the air
 Outside, a trembling, empty brightness falls
 In hunger on those whom it would devour
 Like any sparrow hawk as darkness falls
 And rises silently up the steel stairs
 To the eleventh and last floor, where I
 Reside on sufferance of authorities
 Until my visas wither, and I die.

 Where is my friend, Rodonda Morton Schiff,
 Whose hulk breasts, cygnet-like, the Totensee,
 Shrilling her bosun’s whistles, piping Death—
 The Almirante of the Doldrums in
 His black cocked hat and braided cape—aboard
 Her scuttling vessel with such poems as just
 Escape confounding his gaunt rape with lust?
 She should be singing my song at this hour.

 It is a simple matter to be brave
 In facing a black screen with a white FIN—
 The final title—fading out as all
 Credits have faded in the final crawl,
 To which the audience has turned its back
 And mumbled, shuffled, struggled into coats
 On its way out to face a different night;
 It is far harder, in the light of day,
 Surrounded by striped student nurses, to
 Endure a slight procedure in which you
 Are the anatomy lesson in pink paint
 Splashed by some master on the tinctured air,
 Complete, in gross detail, to the grimace
 Denoted by a squiggle on your face
 As the bone-marrow needle sinks its fang
 Through atomies of drugged and dullard skin
 And subcutaneum to pierce the thin,
 Tough eggshell of the pelvic arch, wherein—
 After steam-hammer pressure—it will suck
 Up sips of specimen tissue with a pain
 Akin to an extraction under gas,
 All gravity against all hollowness.
 Affronted and affrighted, I can’t pass
 This episode in silent dignity
 Or bloodless banter; I must sweat and grunt
 And moan in corporal fear of corporal pain
 Too venial to be mortal, making a fool
 Of my lay figure in its textbook pose
 (Fig. 1) before these starched and giggling girls
 Too young to be let out of simpering school
 To meet live terror face to face and lose.

 Why must the young male nurse who preps the plain
 Of my knife-thrower’s-target abdomen
 With his conversant razor, talking snicks
 Of scything into my sedated ears,
 Talk also in his flat and friendly voice,
 So far from showdowns, on a blasé note
 Of reassurance, learnt by classroom rote?
 It is that he must make his living, too.

 If Hell abides on earth this must be it:
 This too-bright-lit-at-all-hours-of-the-day-
 And-night recovery room, where nurses flit
 In stroboscopic steps between the beds
 All cheek by jowl that hold recoverers
 Suspended in the grog of half-damped pain
 And tubularities of light-blue light.
 For condiment in this mulled mix, there are
 Assorted groans and screams; and, lest repose
 Outstrip the sufferer, there is his own
 Throat-filling Gobi, mucous membrane gone
 Dry as Arabia, as barren of
 Hydropsy as a sunburnt cage of bone
 Perched on parched rocks where game Parcheesian
 (A devil figure, this) went, wended his 
 Bent way to harvest, for a shekel, rugs,
 And pack them back by camel over sands
 Of nightmare to transship to richer lands
 Where millions of small rills plash into streams
 That give rise to great rivers—such wet dreams
 Afflict the desiccate on their interminable way
 Up through the layers of half-light to day.

 The riddle of the Sphinx. Man walks on three
 Legs at the last. I walk on three, one of 
 Which is a wheeled I.V. pole, when I rise
 From bed the first time to make my aged way
 Into the toilet, where, while my legs sway
 And the pole sways, swinging its censer high,
 I wait to urinate, and cannot make
 My mortal coils distill a drop, as time
 Stumps past and leaves me swaying there. Defeat:
 I roll and hobble back to bed, to the
 Refrain of cheeping wheels. Soon the young man
 With his snake-handler’s fist of catheters
 Will come to see me and supply the lack
 Of my drugged muscles with the gravity
 Of his solution, and I’ll void into
 A beige bag clipped to the bedside, one of 
 The bottles, bags, and tubes I’m tethered to
 As a condition of continuance.
 The body swells until it duns the mind
 With importunities in this refined,
 White-sheeted torture, practiced by a kind,
 Withdrawn white face trained in the arts of love.

 Home, and the lees of autumn scuttle up
 To my halt feet: fat, sportive maple leaves
 Struck into ochre by the frost and stripped
 From their umbilic cords to skate across
 The blacktop drive and fetch up on my shoes
 As if including me in their great fall,
 Windy with rumors of the coming ice.
 Though fallen, frostbit, yellowed also, I
 Cannot participate in their late game
 But must leave them to hide and seek a place
 To decompose in, while I clamber up
 Long enneads of stairs to the room where
 I’ll recompose myself to durance in
 A world of voices and surprises, for
 As long as Clotho draws my filament—
 To my now flagging wonder and applause—
 From indefatigable spinnerets,
 Until her sister widows, having set
 The norms for length and texture of each strand
 And sharpened their gross shears, come cut it off
 And send me to befriend the winter leaves.

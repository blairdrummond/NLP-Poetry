Ampersand to start the poem, keep you going, there’s a
 Next Anne Cunningham
 Now intubated in white bed mountain range —
 Event brought you here and event will blow you onward.
  
      this is the refrain from Anne harm
      refrain from all harm
      events blowing forward
      gentle your train
      refrain from all damn harm
  
 Camp out in the mountains
 Under fluorescent hiss and beep.
 Nina (pet) put to sleep, ancient incontinent;
 Now you mourn blood
 Into your gastric tract.
 Noble body, gather your
 Guts, seal the passage:
 Have to die sometime but curving intricate
 Amerspand-tract says you’ll
 Meet us for breakfast.
  
     this is the refrain from Anne harm
      refrain from all harm
      events blowing forward
      gentle your train
      refrain from all damn harm

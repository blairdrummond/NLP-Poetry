title : Warm Days in January

It has never been so easy to cry 
openly or to acknowledge children. 
Never before could I walk directly 
to the center of an island city 
feeling the automatism of millions 
drawing one pious breath, shouldering 
the sunset, holding it up in the oily 
tree-line a while longer. Years ago, 
I was never sad enough and nothing 
but a hotel that I could tear to pieces 
and reconstruct inside a shoebox 
felt like home. My parents died. Their miserable 
possessions washed up in other hotels, 
dioramas of the febrile romantic. 

I take my first lover, already 
gray at her temples and more reticent 
than shy, more tacit than admiring, 
to the bus stop by the Jewish Museum. 
We wait in the dark a long time. 
She does not kiss me. She hurries 
up out of the oily street onto the humming, 
fluorescent podium of the last bus 
where I see her a last time, not waving 
to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom 
we traduced years ago in our first kiss. 

Never deny the power of withdrawal. 
Never doubt that thought and time make things small. 
Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed 
uncomprehending gesture. At childhood’s end, 
none can tell happiness from buoyancy. 
None of it made any difference— 
the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed, 
the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion. 
We are no more complicated 
than our great-grandparents who dreaded 
the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge 
of warm days in January, a piety 
whose compulsion is to survive according 
to explicit laws no young woman adores 
or young man follows with darling hunger.

Crashing 
again—Basquiat 
sends fenders 

& letters headlong 
into each other 
the future. Fusion. 

AAAAAAAAAAA. 

Big Bang. The Big 
Apple, Atom's 
behind him— 

no sirens 
in sight. His career 
of careening 

since—at six— 
playing stickball 
a car stole 

his spleen. Blind 
sided. Move 
along folks—nothing 

to see here. Driven, 
does two Caddys 
colliding, biting 

the dust he's begun 
to snort. Hit 
& run. Red 

Cross—the pill-pale 
ambulance, inside 
out, he hitched 

to the hospital. 
Joy ride. Hot 
wired. O the rush 

before the wreck— 

each Cadillac, 
a Titanic, 
an iceberg that's met 

its match—cabin 
flooded 
like an engine, 

drawing even 
dark Shine 
from below deck. 

FLATS FIX. Chop 

shop. Body work 
while-u-wait. In situ 
the spleen 

or lien, anterior view— 
removed. Given 
Gray's Anatomy 

by his mother for recovery— 

151. Reflexion of spleen 
turned forwards 
& to the right, like 

pages of a book— 
Basquiat pulled 
into orbit 

with tide, the moon 
gold as a tooth, 
a hubcap gleaming, 

gleaned—Shine 
swimming for land, 
somewhere solid 

to spin his own obit.

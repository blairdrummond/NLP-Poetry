title : Earth Day Story

text : 
I remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar
 Of the Minneapolis Street Railway Company
 And the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan
 Worn smooth by decades of passengers
 The worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats
 And the motorman’s little bell
 Windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue
 Liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass
 The gnarled hand of the motorman near.
 My grandmother arranged herself against the seat
 Her back as straight as a soldier’s beside me
 Her navy hat with velvet band
 And net veil down making her head seem distant,
 Her dreaming smile and the patient Roman nose,
 A repose so deep; from my place
 I watched her when we rode like princes
 Rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles
 Riding downtown together, my hands in hers;
 All that so much
 That I love yet but feel no sadness for, that
 Time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up
 Or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized. ﻿

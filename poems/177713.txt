title : Holy Cussing

author : Robert Morgan

text : 
When the most intense revivals swept 
the mountains just a century ago, 
participants described the shouts and barks 
in unknown tongues, the jerks of those who tried 
to climb the walls, the holy dance and laugh. 
But strangest are reports of what was called 
the holy cuss. Sometimes a man who spoke 
in tongues and leapt for joy would break into 
an avalanche of cursing that would stun 
with brilliance and duration. Those that heard 
would say the holy spirit spoke as from 
a whirlwind. Words burned on the air like chains 
of dynamite. The listeners felt transfigured, 
and felt true contact and true presence then, 
as if the shock of unfamiliar 
and blasphemous profanity broke through 
beyond the reach of prayer and song and hallo 
to answer heaven's anger with its echo.

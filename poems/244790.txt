title : — shall become as —

author : Evie Shockley

text : 
            you put this pen
 in my hand and you
 take the pen from
             my hand. the night
 before the full moon
  
             the moon seems
 full. what is missing
 is a dark hungry
             sickle, the sliver
 of shadow eating
  
             us up inside. after
 the mountains breathe
 their mint-and-sorrow
             green against the long
 summer sky, they burst
  
             into hot october
 laughter, lighting
 the horizon with citrus,
             rust, and blood. you
 put this knife in my
             
             hand. we pull. we
 meet as oceans come
 together, heaving
             against and clinging
 across our salt watery
  
             boundary. we approach
 endlessly like two rails 
 of one track, tied
             in a parallel that
 promises our eyes to
  
             merge, someplace far
 off in the distance. you
 put this feather in my
             palm. my fingers
 close around flight.

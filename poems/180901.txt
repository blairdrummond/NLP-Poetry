title : Love Song

author : Mary Carolyn Davies

text : 
There is a strong wall about me to protect me: 
It is built of the words you have said to me. 

There are swords about me to keep me safe: 
They are the kisses of your lips. 

Before me goes a shield to guard me from harm: 
It is the shadow of your arms between me and danger. 

All the wishes of my mind know your name, 
And the white desires of my heart 
They are acquainted with you. 
The cry of my body for completeness, 
That is a cry to you. 
My blood beats out your name to me, 
    unceasing, pitiless 
Your name, your name.

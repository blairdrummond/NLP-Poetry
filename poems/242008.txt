title : Said the Toad

author : J. Patrick Lewis

text : 
I was really in a muddle
looking over a mud puddle
'cause I didn't have a paddle
or a twig to ride the reef. 
But I said, Oh, fiddle-faddle,
this is just a little piddle
of a second fiddle puddle
so I saddled up a leaf. 
I set sail on the puddle,
but I reached the muddy middle
and I rocked the leaf a little, 
then I gave it all I had. 
And I solved the mighty riddle
of the whole caboodle puddle
when I hopped up on the middle
of a beetle launching pad.

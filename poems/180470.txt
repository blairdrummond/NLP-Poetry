Luis Buñuel
A white bull, a cassock, an antique mirror 
The famous ones have passed hours in front of, 
A midnight blue tuxedo, a fainting couch, a key 
To a box of lewd photographs, a swastika, 
Twelve bales of hay, three grave plots, a statue 
Of Christ holding a heart pierced by a dagger, 
A black patch, all kinds of utensils for the sick— 
Including thirty-nine feet of catheter tubing, 
A houseboat, a dog, a baby grand, an oar 
Said to have been carved from a lovely river 
And a woman’s hat by Alfred Jarry, a mattress, 
A shotgun, a diving helmet, an essay on The Art 
Of Taxidermy and a clitoris mounted on a ring 
Like quartz, a crescent wrench, a bulldozer.

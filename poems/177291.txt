title : They eat out

author : Margaret Atwood

text : 
In restaurants we argue
over which of us will pay for your funeral

though the real question is
whether or not I will make you immortal.

At the moment only I 
can do it and so

I raise the magic fork
over the plate of beef fried rice

and plunge it into your heart. 
There is a faint pop, a sizzle

and through your own split head 
you rise up glowing;

the ceiling opens
a voice sings Love Is A Many

Splendoured Thing
you hang suspended above the city

in blue tights and a red cape, 
your eyes flashing in unison.

The other diners regard you
some with awe, some only with bordom:

they cannot decide if you are a new weapon 
or only a new advertisement.

As for me, I continue eating;
I liked you better the way you were, 
but you were always ambitious.

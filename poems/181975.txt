title : January 1919

author : Christopher Middleton

text : 
What if I know, Liebknecht, who shot you dead. 
Tiegarten trees unroll 
staggering shadow, in spite of it all. 
I am among the leaves; the inevitable 
voices 
have nothing left to say, the holed head 
bleeding across a heap of progressive magazines; 
torn from your face, 
trees that turned around, 
we do not sanctify the land with our wandering. 
Look upon our children, they are mutilated.

The pure products of America 
go crazy-- 
mountain folk from Kentucky 

or the ribbed north end of 
Jersey 
with its isolate lakes and 

valleys, its deaf-mutes, thieves 
old names 
and promiscuity between 

devil-may-care men who have taken 
to railroading 
out of sheer lust of adventure-- 

and young slatterns, bathed 
in filth 
from Monday to Saturday 

to be tricked out that night 
with gauds 
from imaginations which have no 

peasant traditions to give them 
character 
but flutter and flaunt 

sheer rags--succumbing without 
emotion 
save numbed terror 

under some hedge of choke-cherry 
or viburnum-- 
which they cannot express-- 

Unless it be that marriage 
perhaps 
with a dash of Indian blood 

will throw up a girl so desolate 
so hemmed round 
with disease or murder 

that she'll be rescued by an 
agent-- 
reared by the state and 

sent out at fifteen to work in 
some hard-pressed 
house in the suburbs-- 

some doctor's family, some Elsie-- 
voluptuous water 
expressing with broken 

brain the truth about us-- 
her great 
ungainly hips and flopping breasts 

addressed to cheap 
jewelry 
and rich young men with fine eyes 

as if the earth under our feet 
were 
an excrement of some sky 

and we degraded prisoners 
destined 
to hunger until we eat filth 

while the imagination strains 
after deer 
going by fields of goldenrod in 

the stifling heat of September 
Somehow 
it seems to destroy us 

It is only in isolate flecks that 
something 
is given off 

No one 
to witness 
and adjust, no one to drive the car

title : The Final Morbidity of the Interior Embezzler

author : Henry Taylor

text : 
It may seem morbid of an embezzler to keep a memorandum, yet many of them do. It may be mere neatness.          -Wallace Stevens, "Surety and Fidelity Claims"
I've made a little sluice-gate in the flow 
of cash across the spreadsheet on my screen. 
Amid torrential chaos and foreseen 
disasters it maintains its small and slow 
on-off diversions, so my work can show 
the delicacy of difference between 
the beans I count and one uncounted bean, 
and where the latter might invisibly go. 

The hollowed shoe-tree, the hermetic jar 
are gadgetry I might revert to yet. 
There is the money of the thing, the far 
secure retirement years, the deep-hedged bet, 
but I love working where the unknowns are, 
and writing down what I need to forget.

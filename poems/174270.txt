title : Aspecta Medusa (for a Drawing)

author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti

text : 
Andromeda, by Perseus sav'd and wed, 
Hanker'd each day to see the Gorgon's head: 
Till o'er a fount he held it, bade her lean, 
And mirror'd in the wave was safely seen 
That death she liv'd by. 

                                     Let not thine eyes know 
Any forbidden thing itself, although 
It once should save as well as kill: but be 
Its shadow upon life enough for thee.

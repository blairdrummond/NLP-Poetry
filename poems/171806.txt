text : 
The Bone-man lives in a stucco   
house. He ticks his heels 

on the cold terrazzo floor.   
He parks his ragtruck 

in the yard, instructs his crew   
on the white telephone. 

I am training my dog 
to attack the red-capped hunter 

bearing his long package. 
I am training the tethered jay 

to cry out against 
the killer who cracks the latch. 

On the open map, the road 
to my house bulges like a vein. 

He takes a train, he rents   
a car, he lurches in 

with an open fly. Sweet Eve   
was just the Farmer’s Daughter, 

he wooed her with a wormy apple.   
He’s a dirty joke, he’s 

always everybody’s last   
lover, he’s a regular 

can of worms—you wry Medusa, 
I am a mongoose staring you down.

title : The Well Rising

author : William E. Stafford

text : 
The well rising without sound, 
the spring on a hillside, 
the plowshare brimming through deep ground 
everywhere in the field— 

The sharp swallows in their swerve 
flaring and hesitating 
hunting for the final curve 
coming closer and closer— 

The swallow heart from wingbeat to wingbeat 
counseling decision, decision: 
thunderous examples. I place my feet 
with care in such a world.

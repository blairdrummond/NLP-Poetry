title : Woman Unborn

author : Anna Swir

text : 
I am not born as yet, 
five minutes before my birth.   
I can still go back 
into my unbirth. 
Now it’s ten minutes before,   
now, it’s one hour before birth.   
I go back, 
I run 
into my minus life. 

I walk through my unbirth as in a tunnel   
with bizarre perspectives. 
Ten years before, 
a hundred and fifty years before, 
I walk, my steps thump, 
a fantastic journey through epochs   
in which there was no me. 

How long is my minus life, 
nonexistence so much resembles immortality. 

Here is Romanticism, where I could have been a spinster,   
Here is the Renaissance, where I would have been 
an ugly and unloved wife of an evil husband, 
The Middle Ages, where I would have carried water in a tavern. 

I walk still further,   
what an echo,   
my steps thump 
through my minus life,   
through the reverse of life.   
I reach Adam and Eve, 
nothing is seen anymore, it’s dark. 
Now my nonexistence dies already 
with the trite death of mathematical fiction. 
As trite as the death of my existence would have been   
had I been really born.

title : in the Catskills again

author : Dick Lourie

text : 
my wife’s bare footprints on these rocks after   
she’s been swimming where the river has dug   
a small pool by the road outside Bearsville 

it looks like rain    no    it’s raining    should I   
follow these delicate marks to find her   
no    she’s just ten feet away    and she turns 

back    green bathing suit    thin legs    orange and   
black towel    it stops raining    her footprints   
going away have evaporated 

but of course she makes new ones heading toward   
me    there are certain moments you stay in   
even as they’re gone    like wet prints on rock   
or the way you cannot forget your dead friends

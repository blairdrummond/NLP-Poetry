title : Slowly: a plainsong from an older woman to a younger woman

author : Judy Grahn

text : 
am I not    olden olden olden
it is unwanted.

wanting, wanting
am I not    broken
stolen    common

am I not crinkled cranky poison
am I not glinty-eyed and frozen

am I not    aged
shaky    glazing
am I not    hazy
guarded    craven

am I not    only
stingy    little
am I not    simple
brittle    spitting

was I not    over
over    ridden?

it is a long story
will you be proud to be my version?

it is unwritten.

writing, writing
am I not    ancient
raging    patient

am I not    able
charming    stable
was I not    building
forming    braving

was I not    ruling
guiding    naming
was I not    brazen
crazy    chosen

even the stones would do my bidding?

it is a long story
am I not proud to be your version?

it is unspoken.

speaking, speaking
am I not    elder
berry
brandy

are you not wine before you find me
in your own beaker?

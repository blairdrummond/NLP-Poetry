title : The Tongues We Speak

author : Patricia Goedicke

text : 
I have arrived here after taking many steps 
Over the kitchen floors of friends and through their lives. 

The dun-colored hills have been good to me 
And the gold rivers. 

I have loved chrysantheumums, and children: 
I have been grandmother to some. 

In one pocket I have hidden chocolates from you 
And knives. 

Speaking my real thoughts to no one 

In bars and at lecterns I have told the truth 
Fairly often, but hardly ever to myself. 

I have not cried out against the crimes of my country 

But I have protected myself, I have watched from a safe corner 
The rape of mountains, the eagle’s reckless plunge. 


Ever since high school I have waved goodbye to history: 

I have assisted you to grow 
In all ways that were convenient to me. 

What is a block vote against steam shovels? 

My current events teacher was a fine man 
But his moral precepts were a put-up job and I followed them. 

Well-dressed, in my new Adidas 
At every gathering I investigated my psyche with friends 

And they investigated theirs with me. 


But whenever Trouble came in the front door I ran out the back 
And fell into the pit of my bones. 

Escaped from those burning buildings, the past, 
What balance can any of us hope for? 

I was comparing lipsticks 
The day Nagasaki vanished. 

The day Solzhenitsyn disappeared into the Gulag 
I was attending a cocktail party. 

Perhaps there are only ashes in my handbag. 

A man at the corner of Broadway and Forty-Second Street 
Tried to sweep me into a trash barrel and I almost agreed. 

Already the dried blood was sifting along my wrists. 

Already my own hands 
Were tightening around my throat 


But Sorrow saved me, Sorrow gave me an image 
Of bombs like human tears watering the world’s gardens. 

How could I not answer? 

Since then I have been planting words 
In every windowbox, poking them to grow up. 

What’s God, That he should be mindful of me? 

Sometimes I feel like wood 
Waiting for someone to peel me. 


Indeed I have been lukewarm 
At heart, which is all that matters. 

Of tiny bread-colored atoms, 
Equal fragments equally dispersed 

That love each other and are never hungry. 


What have I ever ignited 
That warmed anyone? 

I have not followed the rivers. 

Dangerous as a pine needle 
Packed in among others, in the dense multitudes 

And dry timbers of the West 

I am afraid of greed, 
The rich taste of it, the anger 

Hidden in my pockets. 


Columns of smoke on the horizon, 
Pillars of green fire. 

But I have arrived here somehow, 
Neither have I stopped talking. 

Numberless are the kitchens I have sat in, 
Chewing my fingers, trying to say something, 

Anything, so that the daughters of men should see 
As many sides of themselves as possible. 


Word after word my footprints 
Have stumbled across deserts. 

How should I escape them? 
They keep following after me. 

A little wind stirs itself, 
Whisks across my eyelids, 

And I know what it is before I say it: 

What if the world really articulates itself 
In the socket of a human knee? 


God save me 
From the swamps of hubris but it may be, it may be. 

Before the idea, the impulse. 

I feel it moving in me, it is there 
Arthritic but still powerful, a seizure 

Delicate as grasshoppers, a light 
Gathering in the skull. 

Between thumb and forefinger 
And the ballbearing joints of the tongue 

In soft, glottal convulsions 
Out of no alien skies 

But out of the mind’s muscle 
The hieroglyph figures rise. 


The little histories of words 
Cannot be eaten. 

I know it, you know it 
And the children... 

But the images we make are our own. 

In the cool caves of the intellect 
The twisted roots of them lead us 

Backwards and then forwards. 


If only we could understand 
What’s in our pockets is for everyone! 

I have a dictionary in one hand, a mirror. 

Strangers look at themselves in it, 
Tracing the expressions they use 

From one family to the next 
They comfort themselves, murmuring 

The tongues we speak are a blizzard 
Of words like warm wool flying: 

In the shy conjugal rites 
Of verb, consonant, vowel, 

In the dark mucosal flesh lining 
The prismed underside of the skin 

Each one is a spark sheared 
From the veined fleece of the spirit 

Of the looking-glass body we live in. 

It is the one I have been cherishing, 
The one all of us speak from, 

For the world as we know it moves 
Necessarily by steps. 

Breath, pulse beat, ten digital stops. 

At the foot of the mountains I look up. Does God 
Lift up His hand to cover them? 

Blinded by tears like rain 
My bones turn granite, the spine of the hills congeals them. 


Where is the eye of the storm, 
Or where is the center of my seeing? 

The wind of my breath is a hurricane: 
I am locked inside myself. 

Painfully, up the bald stepladder I climb, 

But sometimes the light in my head goes on 
More like the sun than a match. 

Just as they said in Arabia 

There’s a huge pantalooned angel swelling 
Inside the body’s glass jar. 

The white-haired thread of steam 
From the teakettle on the range whistles 

And sharpens itself into a voice 

Bodiless as history, invisible 
But still whispering in ears 

That keep trying to hear it. 

It is as if midgets were bellowing their names 
Down sets of cardboard cylinders. 

But we have not disappeared 
Yet. 

My friends, we have said many things to each other 

In new combinations, seed upon seed exploding 
And blossoming in kitchen gardens. 

I confess I am ashamed of myself: 

I have not tried hard enough to understand 
Or listen to you speak. 


But the Word is mindful of itself 
And always has been. 

Littering every street 

In the sly eyes of tin cans, 
Drops of water in the gutter 

The world looks back at us 


From every known language: 
Yoruba, Hebrew, Chinese, 

Arrogant English, the subject 
Subjecting all to its desires, 

Even the softer tongues, romantic 

Self-reflexive, done to 
As we would be done by, 

Whatever life we cultivate 
Out of the animal moans of childhood 

It is all wheat fields, all grass 
Growing and being grown. 

With poisoned bread in my pockets, or gumdrops, 
Or armies like Myrmidons rising 

What I say is true 
For a time only, thank God, 

If I have only arrived anywhere it is to look 
Carefully, at all I thought I knew. 


In living rivers of speech 
The reflections I make are my own 

And yet not: 

Though the old growth rings are hidden from us 
And the echoing tomorrows of the acorn, 

The warm currents of the senses 
Are a two-way street, my friends: 

The palms of our hands are crisscrossed 
With as many intersections as a leaf.

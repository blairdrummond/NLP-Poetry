Tall Ambrosia 
Henry David Thoreau 
1817-1862

U.S., New, England
Nature, Trees & Flowers



Among the signs of autumn I perceive 
The Roman wormwood (called by learned men 
Ambrosia elatior, food for gods,-- 
For to impartial science the humblest weed 
Is as immortal once as the proudest flower--) 
Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoes 
As I cross the now neglected garden. 
--We trample under foot the food of gods 
And spill their nectar in each drop of dew-- 
My honest shoes, fast friends that never stray 
Far from my couch, thus powdered, countryfied, 
Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure, 
At the post-house disgrace the Gallic gloss 
Of those well dressed ones who no morning dew 
Nor Roman wormwood ever have been through, 
Who never walk but are transported rather-- 
For what old crime of theirs I do not gather.

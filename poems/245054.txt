title : The Afterlife

author : Roy Fisher

text : 
I’ve lived within half a mile of it
 for twenty years. West 
 by the black iron weather-hen
 half-strangled with clematis
 on the garage roof
 I can locate it. Past a low ridge
 in the cliff face of a limestone dale
 there’s a cave in the bushes.
  
 When the old tigers
 were long since gone, leaving their
 teeth, the valley people
 would climb there with the dead
 they thought most useful;
  
 push them well in,
  
 take them out again,
 walk them around:
 ‘They’re coming! They’re coming’
  
             We Malagasies love
             our second burials.
             We hire a band that comes
             in a van. Again
             with liquefaction almost done
             we hold our cherished ones
             in our arms. From the grave-clothes
             they fall in gobbets as dog-food
             falls from the can. We wrap them
             in fresh dry linen. They
             bless our lives with their happiness.
  
 Walk them around the valley. Drop
 here a finger
 for the god that is a rat or a raven,
 here a metatarsal
 to set under the hearth for luck.
  
 And what was luck?
  
 The afterlife back then
 was fairly long:
 nothing demented like for ever,
  
 nothing military. The afterlife
 would come to the party.

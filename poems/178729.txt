text : 
Apprentice morning come easily now, 
silver with fog and the breakdowns 
of neighbors: shouts from up hill 
where the land curls under vines and under the porches   
of oaks, where even now 
wintergreen and inkberry shiver forth 
streamers of new growth, and the green frogs 
suck at the dew and sing their bent songs. 

It is easy 
to hear my own voice in the liquid 
contraltos of rage, the vents 
and accusations that feed fires 
up the hill. It is all human enough, 
the yelling, capacious 
and frank, the doors slamming, cries 
of betrayal. I too have betrayed, 
lost my place among the condensations   
of commitment, dallied. 
                                                I go among friends 
who say with neither fear nor fury in their voices 
that they too don’t know what’s next, that from the studied   
impactment of their lives 
they have sallied small lines 
of proposition, made a few calls. Slight affairs   
shiver and fail; we go for a walk 
by the rotunda, where, on the perishable lawn,   
a band plays Dixieland—speaking, 
not earnestly, but with steady intent, 
of the play of choices, the simple chance 
of another future somewhere else, perhaps a house   
in the hills above L.A., part-time work   
for the screen, a few avocado trees. For a while 
it is as if the hazy play of evening light, 
the splashes of music, the unbundled oaks 
surrounding the Square, are enough 
in themselves to sustain, as if mood 
is itself sustenance, that our struggle to conceive   
a continuance is of no more moment 
than the fuchsia and soft yellow clothes of the tourists. 

Perhaps it is possible 
to be gentle no matter what, to seek not restraint   
but surrender entirely, to turn 
from the snarling reproach not into the keening   
dismissal of hope but to whatever bright 
fluttering is next, the bright fluttering 
of wisteria petals, a felicitous 
phrase, fingers touching 
a face. How else to avoid 
redemption, 
or its opposite, which we stopped believing   
in one day in high school, suddenly startled   
over a steaming lunch tray by the way the fizzed   
flowers of a stunted mimosa 
seemed to beg for release? We realized then 
we could say whatever we wanted, that the world   
was no more particular 
than anything else, it too could be out-argued,   
confused by refusal or lies, that it was no wonder   
people were stunned 
by the eloquent permanence of death. 
                                                                        So there is   
permission, not granted 
but given, as a forsythia at the edge of the walk,   
having stolen more light 
than it can contain, trembles, and the echoes 
of argument fade into a fluttering 
over the price of butterscotch floats, 
and we are dazzled 
by the gouge of perception, as if there was in fact a word   
we were waiting to hear, not 
as completion but as synoptic 
and inevitable entitlement—the drift 
of some stranger’s conversation, 
the memory of a thin mist 
moored temporarily over the garden, that face 
we saw from the window on the way to St. Albans: beautiful,   
indifferent, unequivocably doomed.

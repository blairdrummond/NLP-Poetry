title : On Hurricane Jackson

author : Alan Dugan

text : 
Now his noseâ€™s bridge is broken, one eye
 will not focus and the other is a stray;
 trainers whisper in his mouth while one ear
 listens to itself, clenched like a fist;
 generally shadowboxing in a smoky room,
 his mind hides like the aching boys
 who lost a contest in the Panhellenic games
 and had to take the back roads home,
 but someone else, his perfect youth,
 laureled in newsprint and dollar bills,
 triumphs forever on the great white way
 to the statistical Sparta of the champs.

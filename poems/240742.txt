title : Variations on Some of Dante’s Last Lines

author : Norma Cole

text : 
And move and hold back
 entering by the highroad through the words
 and fall like a person hit by sleep
 arriving at the place without light
  
 And fall like a dead body falls
 and find there the great enemy
 and come to a tower all of stones
 such that through it the earth opens
  
 We pass between the martyrs and the high walls
 even up there water is pouring out
 then turning and fording again
 sling the noose from the roof of the house
  
 And each and every vapor spent
 over winning and not losing
 in which it stands caught out
 fleet then catapults like a stone
  
 Filling our view
 whereupon another valley is revealed

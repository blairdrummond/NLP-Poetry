title : Moon Missing

author : Allan Peterson

text : 
I was so worried the hickory I recognized
 had died from salt burn in the last hurricane
 I may have passed by vervain and apple haw
 like they didn’t matter, but this spring
 it put out seven shoots from its base.
 Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,
 then the “new” moon appears,
 though we know it’s the old one, and we pretend
 to be taken in like the mother or baby
 behind the bath towel.
 Really it’s the moon winking,
 being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.
 And when I tell Frances, I see she is a moon
 motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting
 a lamp, a face that awakens on paper.

I am thirty this November. 
You are still small, in your fourth year. 
We stand watching the yellow leaves go queer, 
flapping in the winter rain, 
falling flat and washed. And I remember 
mostly the three autumns you did not live here. 
They said I’d never get you back again. 
I tell you what you’ll never really know: 
all the medical hypothesis 
that explained my brain will never be as true as these 
struck leaves letting go. 

I, who chose two times 
to kill myself, had said your nickname 
the mewling months when you first came; 
until a fever rattled 
in your throat and I moved like a pantomime 
above your head. Ugly angels spoke to me. The blame, 
I heard them say, was mine. They tattled 
like green witches in my head, letting doom 
leak like a broken faucet; 
as if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet, 
an old debt I must assume. 

Death was simpler than I’d thought. 
The day life made you well and whole 
I let the witches take away my guilty soul. 
I pretended I was dead 
until the white men pumped the poison out, 
putting me armless and washed through the rigamarole 
of talking boxes and the electric bed. 
I laughed to see the private iron in that hotel. 
Today the yellow leaves 
go queer. You ask me where they go. I say today believed 
in itself, or else it fell. 

Today, my small child, Joyce, 
love your self’s self where it lives. 
There is no special God to refer to; or if there is, 
why did I let you grow 
in another place. You did not know my voice 
when I came back to call. All the superlatives 
of tomorrow’s white tree and mistletoe 
will not help you know the holidays you had to miss. 
The time I did not love 
myself, I visited your shoveled walks; you held my glove. 
There was new snow after this.

They sent me letters with news 
of you and I made moccasins that I would never use. 
When I grew well enough to tolerate 
myself, I lived with my mother. Too late,
too late, to live with your mother, the witches said. 
But I didn’t leave. I had my portrait 
done instead. 

Part way back from Bedlam 
I came to my mother’s house in Gloucester, 
Massachusetts. And this is how I came 
to catch at her; and this is how I lost her. 
I cannot forgive your suicide, my mother said. 
And she never could. She had my portrait 
done instead. 

I lived like an angry guest, 
like a partly mended thing, an outgrown child. 
I remember my mother did her best. 
She took me to Boston and had my hair restyled. 
Your smile is like your mother’s, the artist said. 
I didn’t seem to care. I had my portrait 
done instead. 

There was a church where I grew up 
with its white cupboards where they locked us up, 
row by row, like puritans or shipmates 
singing together. My father passed the plate. 
Too late to be forgiven now, the witches said. 
I wasn’t exactly forgiven. They had my portrait 
done instead.

All that summer sprinklers arched 
over the seaside grass. 
We talked of drought 
while the salt-parched 
field grew sweet again. To help time pass 
I tried to mow the lawn 
and in the morning I had my portrait done, 
holding my smile in place, till it grew formal. 
Once I mailed you a picture of a rabbit 
and a postcard of Motif number one, 
as if it were normal 
to be a mother and be gone. 

They hung my portrait in the chill 
north light, matching 
me to keep me well. 
Only my mother grew ill. 
She turned from me, as if death were catching, 
as if death transferred, 
as if my dying had eaten inside of her. 
That August you were two, but I timed my days with doubt. 
On the first of September she looked at me 
and said I gave her cancer. 
They carved her sweet hills out 
and still I couldn’t answer.

That winter she came 
part way back 
from her sterile suite 
of doctors, the seasick 
cruise of the X-ray, 
the cells’ arithmetic 
gone wild. Surgery incomplete, 
the fat arm, the prognosis poor, I heard 
them say. 

During the sea blizzards 
she had here 
own portrait painted. 
A cave of mirror 
placed on the south wall; 
matching smile, matching contour. 
And you resembled me; unacquainted 
with my face, you wore it. But you were mine 
after all. 

I wintered in Boston, 
childless bride, 
nothing sweet to spare 
with witches at my side. 
I missed your babyhood, 
tried a second suicide, 
tried the sealed hotel a second year. 
On April Fool you fooled me. We laughed and this 
was good.

I checked out for the last time 
on the first of May; 
graduate of the mental cases, 
with my analyst’s okay, 
my complete book of rhymes, 
my typewriter and my suitcases. 

All that summer I learned life 
back into my own 
seven rooms, visited the swan boats, 
the market, answered the phone, 
served cocktails as a wife 
should, made love among my petticoats 

and August tan. And you came each 
weekend. But I lie. 
You seldom came. I just pretended 
you, small piglet, butterfly 
girl with jelly bean cheeks, 
disobedient three, my splendid 

stranger. And I had to learn 
why I would rather 
die than love, how your innocence 
would hurt and how I gather 
guilt like a young intern 
his symptoms, his certain evidence. 

That October day we went 
to Gloucester the red hills 
reminded me of the dry red fur fox 
coat I played in as a child; stock-still 
like a bear or a tent, 
like a great cave laughing or a red fur fox. 

We drove past the hatchery, 
the hut that sells bait, 
past Pigeon Cove, past the Yacht Club, past Squall’s 
Hill, to the house that waits 
still, on the top of the sea, 
and two portraits hung on the opposite walls.

In north light, my smile is held in place, 
the shadow marks my bone. 
What could I have been dreaming as I sat there, 
all of me waiting in the eyes, the zone 
of the smile, the young face, 
the foxes’ snare. 

In south light, her smile is held in place, 
her cheeks wilting like a dry 
orchid; my mocking mirror, my overthrown 
love, my first image. She eyes me from that face, 
that stony head of death 
I had outgrown. 

The artist caught us at the turning; 
we smiled in our canvas home 
before we chose our foreknown separate ways. 
The dry red fur fox coat was made for burning. 
I rot on the wall, my own 
Dorian Gray. 

And this was the cave of the mirror, 
that double woman who stares 
at herself, as if she were petrified 
in time — two ladies sitting in umber chairs. 
You kissed your grandmother 
and she cried. 


7. 

I could not get you back 
except for weekends. You came 
each time, clutching the picture of a rabbit 
that I had sent you. For the last time I unpack 
your things. We touch from habit. 
The first visit you asked my name. 
Now you stay for good. I will forget 
how we bumped away from each other like marionettes 
on strings. It wasn’t the same 
as love, letting weekends contain 
us. You scrape your knee. You learn my name, 
wobbling up the sidewalk, calling and crying. 
You call me mother and I remember my mother again, 
somewhere in greater Boston, dying. 

I remember we named you Joyce 
so we could call you Joy. 
You came like an awkward guest 
that first time, all wrapped and moist 
and strange at my heavy breast. 
I needed you. I didn’t want a boy, 
only a girl, a small milky mouse 
of a girl, already loved, already loud in the house 
of herself. We named you Joy. 
I, who was never quite sure 
about being a girl, needed another 
life, another image to remind me. 
And this was my worst guilt; you could not cure 
nor soothe it. I made you to find me.

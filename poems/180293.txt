text : 
Psychoanalysis 
always looks for the egg 
in a basket 
that has been lost. 

*       *       * 

I sample sin as if it were 
the beginning of well-being. 

*       *       * 

I don't like Paradise 
as they probably don't have obsessions there. 

*       *       * 

If God absolves me 
he always does so 
for insufficient 
evidence. 

*       *       * 

Everyone is a friend of his own pathology. 

*       *       * 

When I raise a toast to madness, 
I toast myself as well. 

*       *       * 

There are nights that don't 
ever happen.

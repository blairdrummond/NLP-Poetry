Old warder of these buried bones, 
         And answering now my random stroke 
         With fruitful cloud and living smoke, 
Dark yew, that graspest at the stones 

And dippest toward the dreamless head, 
         To thee too comes the golden hour 
         When flower is feeling after flower; 
But Sorrowifixt upon the dead, 

And darkening the dark graves of men,i 
         What whisper'd from her lying lips? 
         Thy gloom is kindled at the tips, 
And passes into gloom again.

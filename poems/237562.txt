title : Exegesis of the First Words Spoken (Ishmael)

author : Dan Beachy-Quick

text : 
Scholar-on-waves, a water-gazer,
Call me

Ishmael. Re-enter my own life.
Waves: they murmur, babble, waves

Do not articulate what the ocean
Turning in its bed thinks: What must be said.

          Sing above or sing
          Below
          The knot in the plank, the cursive
          Pine-grain
          Of my life in the bow and my life

          Bay-less in the bowels
          Of the bow

I signed myself on as me
                                     to become more so
                                                                  myself—
A study, one volume of 36 signatures, 576 pages (9 blank for notes),
And became dispossessed of all
                                              but one mis-
                                              spoken leaf—
Pro- and epilogue both. Sign your mark. I do

Find the escape

Clause titled in fine print, watermarked, on condition

Of being or becoming: me

Tar-dark, thumbless or thumbed,
Ocean eats the nib of pen
But a nub dipped in pitch

          Sing above or sing below
          The wave’s back
          Broken by another wave

          There is no air besides

A nub dipped in pitch
Can’t help

But write, beneath the sea-hawk’s wing
The sea-hawk’s cry, Sign your mark

With a nail, a splinter, a harpoon
In the hand can’t help

But
          Sing above and sing below
But write but
          What song strides surface tension
Help but write
          Thirst chokes and salt slakes
A contract for a name

Of being or becoming
Ink on the line, a name or a contract

For a name, a thumbprint, or I
Signed me on on my name alone: Now

Profit Now Leak Now Bury Now Speak.

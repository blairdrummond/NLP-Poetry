The game of baseball is not a metaphor   
and I know it’s not really life.   
The chalky green diamond, the lovely   
dusty brown lanes I see from airplanes   
multiplying around the cities   
are only neat playing fields.   
Their structure is not the frame   
of history carved out of forest,   
that is not what I see on my ascent. 

And down in the stadium, 
the veteran catcher guiding the young   
pitcher through the innings, the line   
of concentration between them,   
that delicate filament is not   
like the way you are helping me,   
only it reminds me when I strain   
for analogies, the way a rookie strains   
for perfection, and the veteran,   
in his wisdom, seems to promise it,   
it glows from his upheld glove, 

and the man in front of me 
in the grandstand, drinking banana   
daiquiris from a thermos, 
continuing through a whole dinner 
to the aromatic cigar even as our team 
is shut out, nearly hitless, he is 
not like the farmer that Auden speaks   
of in Breughel’s Icarus, 
or the four inevitable woman-hating   
drunkards, yelling, hugging 
each other and moving up and down   
continuously for more beer 

and the young wife trying to understand   
what a full count could be 
to please her husband happy in   
his old dreams, or the little boy 
in the Yankees cap already nodding   
off to sleep against his father, 
program and popcorn memories   
sliding into the future, 
and the old woman from Lincoln, Maine,   
screaming at the Yankee slugger   
with wounded knees to break his leg 

this is not a microcosm,   
not even a slice of life 

and the terrible slumps, 
when the greatest hitter mysteriously   
goes hitless for weeks, or 
the pitcher’s stuff is all junk 
who threw like a magician all last month,   
or the days when our guys look 
like Sennett cops, slipping, bumping   
each other, then suddenly, the play 
that wasn’t humanly possible, the Kid   
we know isn’t ready for the big leagues,   
leaps into the air to catch a ball 
that should have gone downtown,   
and coming off the field is hugged   
and bottom-slapped by the sudden   
sorcerers, the winning team 

the question of what makes a man   
slump when his form, his eye, 
his power aren’t to blame, this isn’t   
like the bad luck that hounds us,   
and his frustration in the games   
not like our deep rage 
for disappointing ourselves 

the ball park is an artifact, 
manicured, safe, “scene in an Easter egg”,   
and the order of the ball game,   
the firm structure with the mystery   
of accidents always contained,   
not the wild field we wander in,   
where I’m trying to recite the rules,   
to repeat the statistics of the game, 
and the wind keeps carrying my words away

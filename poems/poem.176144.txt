Couplet

Mown meadows skirt the standing wheat;   
I linger, for the hay is sweet, 
New-cut and curing in the sun. 
Like furrows, straight, the windrows run,   
Fallen, gallant ranks that tossed and bent   
When, yesterday, the west wind went   
A-rioting through grass and grain.   
To-day no least breath stirs the plain;   
Only the hot air, quivering, yields   
Illusive motion to the fields 
Where not the slenderest tassel swings.   
Across the wheat flash sky-blue wings;   
A goldfinch dangles from a tall,   
Full-flowered yellow mullein; all 
The world seems turning blue and gold.   
Unstartled, since, even from of old,   
Beauty has brought keen sense of her,   
I feel the withering grasses stir;   
Along the edges of the wheat, 
I hear the rustle of her feet: 
And yet I know the whole sea lies,   
And half the earth, between our eyes.

title : A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop

author : Thomas Sayers Ellis

text : 
All those
    Liquid love affairs,
Blind swimmers
    Trusting rumps.
We wiggled,
     Imagining water.
Wet, where was
     The One?
Nevermind Atlantis
    And the promise
Of moving pictures,
    A lit candle
In the window
    Of our conscious minds.
Those who danced,
    Pretending to swim
Underwater,
    Did so out
Of pure allegiance. 
    Some wore snorkels
Made with 
    The waistbands
Of funky underwear,
    Others wet suits
With clothespins
    Clamped to their noses,
Airtight as
     Black Power handshakes.
Rump-by-rump,
     The strings attached
To our thangs were
     Reeled into The Deep
And rhythmic as fins,
     Schools of P signs
Flapped and waved
     Like flags.
One nation
     Under a groove.
No one held their breath
     In the flashlit depth.
No one sank.

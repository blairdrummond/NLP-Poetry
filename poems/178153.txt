text : 
Tottering and elastic, middle name of Groan,   
ramfeezled after a hard night 
at the corpse-polishing plant, slope- 
shouldered, a half loaf 
of bread, even his hair tired, famished,   
fingering the diminished beans 
in his pocket—you meet him. 
On a thousand street corners you meet him,   
emerging from the subway, emerging   
from your own chest—this sight’s shrill,   
metallic vapors pass into you. 
His fear is of being broken, 
of becoming too dexterous in stripping   
the last few shoelaces of meat 
from a chicken’s carcass, of being moved by nothing   
short of the Fall of Rome, of being stooped   
in the cranium over some loss he’s forgotten   
the anniversary of.... You meet him,   
know his defeat, though proper 
and inevitable, is not yours, although yours also   
is proper and inevitable: so many defeats   
queer and insignificant (as illustration:   
the first time you lay awake all night 
waiting for dawn—and were disappointed), so many   
no-hope exhaustions hidden, 
their gaze dully glazed inward.—And yet we all   
fix our binoculars on the horizon’s hazy fear-heaps   
and cruise toward them, fat sails 
forward.... You meet him on the corners,   
in bus stations, on the blind avenues 
leading neither in 
nor out of hell, you meet him 
and with him you walk.

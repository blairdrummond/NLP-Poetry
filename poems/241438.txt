title : A Rod for a Handsome Price

author : Nicole Brossard

text : 
(from her to ravish meaning ravine On the other side 
artifice slumbers in the green. The shadow follows hour 
by hour hollow and gloomy and which call me forth)
……………………………….grafted onto the sentence 
o a long time distant to hang on my belly obscure parallel 
images and tattoos age suggestive of the fingernail grazing 
the thigh the valley get turned on






 the body gentle with daring
 drug to take away her meaning
 her skin of orange and olive
 her texture of assailing couple
 (you underline them with a stroke
 like the bed under their weight
 their pleasure)
  
 …………..and plunge down
 and so body to body in the tuft
 her spreading out in vegetation
 right to them
 the point of consent and
 affirmation
  
 little magic boxes…………….






 the skin a free grammar
 of silence canvas of impressions of
 representation
 fire: artifice a distance
 the true skin strips off the vowels
 illustrate
 the soft sponges of the fine cob






 the definite connection that exists
 between ravishing meaning from her and
 magic boxes
  
 *
  
 A ROD FOR A HANDSOME PRICE swells
 (but)
 since the grafts
                gently the words run
                along it quietly.

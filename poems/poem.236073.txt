I saw an eagle sweep to the sky-- 
The Godlike! - seeking his place on high, 
With a strong, and wild, and rapid wing--
A dark, and yet a dazzling thing; 
And his arching neck, his bristling crest, 
And the dark plumes quivering upon his breast; 
And his eye, bent up to each beam of light, 
Like a bright sword flash'd with a sword in fight. 

I saw him rise o'er the forest trees; 
I saw his pinion ride the breeze; 
Beyond the clouds I watched him tower 
On his path of pride - his flight of power. 
I watched him wheeling, stern and lone, 
Where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown; 
Soaring, circling - bathed in light: 
Such was that desert eagle's flight. 

Suddenly, then, to my straining eye, 
I saw the strong wing slack on high; 
Falling, falling to earth once more; 
The dark breast covered with foam and gore; 
The dark eyes' glory dim with pain; 
Sick to death with a sun-struck brain! 
Reeling down from that height divine, 
Eagle of heaven! such fall was thine! 

Even so we see the sons of light, 
Up to the day-beam steer their flight; 
And the wing of genius cleaves the sky, 
As the clouds rush on when the winds are high: 
Then comes the hour of sudden dread--  
Then is the blasting sunlight shed; 
And the gifted fall in their agony, 
Sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!

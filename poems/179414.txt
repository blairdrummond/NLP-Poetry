title : New York

new york, madame, 
                                  is a monument to a city 

it is   
TA-DA   
a gigantic pike 
whose scales   
bristled up stunned 

and what used to be just smoke   
found a fire that gave it birth 

champagne foam   
melted into metal   
glass rivers   
flowing upwards   
and things you won't tell to a priest   
you reveal to a cabdriver   

even time is sold out   
when to the public's "wow" and "shhh"   
out of a black top hat   
a tailed magician   
is pulling new york out   
by the ears of skyscrapers

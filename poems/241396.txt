title : Night Dive

Plankton rise toward the full moon 
spread thin on Wakaya’s surface. 
Manta rays’ great curls of jaw 
scoop backward somersaults of ocean 
in through painted caves of their mouths, out 
through sliced gills. Red sea fans
pulse. The leopard shark 
lounges on a smooth ramp of sand, 
skin jeweled with small hangers-on. 
Pyramid fish point the way to the surface.

Ninety feet down, blue ribbon eels cough, 
their mouths neon cautions. 
Ghost pipefish curl in the divemaster’s palm. 
Soft corals unfurl rainbow polyps, thousands 
of mouths held open to night.
Currents’ communion—giant clams 
slam shut wavy jaws, send 
shivers of water. Christmas tree worms 
snap back, flat spirals tight,
living petroglyphs against the night.

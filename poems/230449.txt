title : Snow Signs

They say it is waiting for more, the snow
   Shrunk up to the shadow-line of walls 
In an arctic smouldering, an unclean salt,
   And will not go until the frost returns 
Sharpening the stars, and the fresh snow falls
   Piling its drifts in scallops, furls. I say 
Snow has left its own white geometry
   To measure out for the eye the way
The land may lie where a too cursory reading
   Discovers only dip and incline leading 
To incline, dip, and misses the fortuitous
   Full variety a hillside spreads for us:
It is written here in sign and exclamation,
   Touched-in contour and chalk-followed fold, 
Lines and circles finding their completion
   In figures less certain, figures that yet take hold 
On features that would stay hidden but for them:
   Walking, we waken these at every turn, 
Waken ourselves, so that our walking seems
   To rouse some massive sleeper out of winter dreams 
Whose stretching startles the whole land into life,
   As if it were us the cold, keen signs were seeking
To pleasure and remeasure, repossess
   With a sense in the gathered coldness of heat and height. 
Well, if it's for more the snow is waiting
   To claim back into disguisal overnight, 
As though it were promising a protection
   From all it has transfigured, scored and bared, 
Now we shall know the force of what resurrection
   Outwaits the simplification of the snow.

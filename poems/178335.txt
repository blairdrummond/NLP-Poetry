title : You and I

author : Stanley Moss

text : 
You are Jehovah, and I am a wanderer.   
Who should have mercy on a wanderer   
if not Jehovah? You create and I decay.   
Who should have mercy on the decayed   
if not the creator? You are the Judge 
and I the guilty Who should have mercy   
on the guilty if not the Judge? You are All   
and I am a particle. Who should have mercy   
on a particle if not the All? 
You are the Living One and I am dead.   
Who should have mercy on the dead if not 
the Living One? You are the Painter and Potter   
and I am clay. Who should have mercy on clay   
if not the Painter and Potter? You are the Fire   
and I am straw Who should have mercy on straw   
if not the Fire? You are the Listener   
and I am the reader. Who should have mercy   
on the reader if not the Listener? You   
are the Beginning and I am what follows.   
Who should have mercy on what follows   
if not the Beginning? You are the End and I am   
what follows. Who should have mercy   
on what follows if not the End?

title : Farewell to Poetry

author : Théophile Gautier

text : 
Come, fallen angel, and your pink wings close;
 Doff your white robe, your rays that gild the skies;
 You must—from heaven, where once you used to rise—
 Streak, like a shooting star, fall into prose.
  
 Your bird’s feet now must strike an earthly pose.
 It is no time to fly: walk! Lock your prize—
 Your harp’s fair harmonies—in resting wise,
 Within your heart: vain, worthless treasures those!
  
 Poor child of heaven, but vainly would you sing:
 To them your tongue divine means not a thing!
 Their ear is closed to your sweet chords! But this
  
 I beg: O blue-eyed angel, first, before
 You leave, find my pale love, whom I adore,
 And give her brow one long, last farewell kiss.

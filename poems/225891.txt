title : For My Contemporaries

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
How time reverses   
The proud in heart!   
I now make verses   
Who aimed at art. 

But I sleep well.   
Ambitious boys 
Whose big lines swell   
With spiritual noise, 

Despise me not! 
And be not queasy   
To praise somewhat:   
Verse is not easy. 

But rage who will. 
Time that procured me   
Good sense and skill   
Of madness cured me.

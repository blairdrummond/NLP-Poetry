 In Tokyo our gallant boys
 dance rock-and-roll, squint eyes
 wary at standing easy. They leer and reel
 on a springboard tip and then
 jackknife toward the electronic noise . . .
  
 And Charley, when Time Inc. said he said
 the President had his head
 wedged about Vietnam
                    burning for honor or—who knows?
 the Action he had said—
                    married the Marines.
 He showered for vows on those
  
 who took his word who taught him
 shoot it out and shout “Yes Sir Yes Sir!”
                    and sent him out like napalm
 obedient to any itchy finger.
  
 I hope the fields of Minnesota gave perspective
 when he moved out
                                      as to the starting line
 on the command, survive, survive.
  
. . . our juiced doughboys feel their girls.

               What
 did I tell you 

when we met
 last and it
  
 “after the leeches and the food”
 on a break
                    in the rain
 was already up with you, Charley?
  
 Mouthing the big cigar
 like a gangster at the wheel . . .
  
                    cigarette between thumb and finger
                    the way we all even in junior high
                    learned not to
                    your men watching in wonder
  
                    him tasting the strange
                             (turned officer so young)
                    foreign taste
                    that smoke:     and all was dark
                           except what sparks
                    he scattered there, stubbing it out
  
 What could we do for you
  
 you hugging your knees
  
                    who taught you
                    to raise your voice?

 No more the wide Mankato pearled with ice
                   under blue January sky
 your arm around the shoulder of the friend who ran faster
 no more the long hours pad in hand composing
                   reasons for your belief
 a belief in fathers has no reason
  
 no more the simple passion of going first
 your hatless straightness, the struggle, the deep worry,
                   the dark Africa of being alive in a country
                   run by chiefs without tribes
 no more of all that, only your 
                   brief beauty in many hearts
 in a time when fathers bury their sons, and you
                   surrounded, cut down
 in a war you were fated never to see,
                   blinded by love for all men.

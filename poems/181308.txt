title : Loners

author : Jean Follain

text : 
The door-latch is always stubborn 
beyond it dozes a beast 
tinged by the fire 
they know who is walking 
the curve of the road 
by their footsteps alone 
glance at the fancy lamp 
hanging from the sooty ceiling 
a green and speckled plant withers 
a child who has wandered cries 
beneath a long low sky 
and at last the snow comes on.

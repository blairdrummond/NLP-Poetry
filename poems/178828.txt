title : Magnificat in Little

author : Léonie Adams

text : 
I was enriched, not casting after marvels,   
But as one walking in a usual place, 
Without desert but common eyes and ears,   
No recourse but to hear, power but to see,   
Got to love you of grace. 

Subtle musicians, that could body wind,   
Or contrive strings to anguish, in conceit   
Random and artless strung a branch with bells,   
Fixed in one silver whim, which at a touch   
Shook and were sweet. 

And you, you lovely and unpurchased note, 
One run distraught, and vexing hot and cold   
To give to the heart’s poor confusion tongue, 
By chance caught you, and henceforth all unlearned   
Repeats you gold.

Here comes dawn and nothing rosy 
about her fingers — stove-flame 
blue and some hand must’ve turned 
the burner on: the little tongues 
licking, gradually, the teapot of  us 
aboil, cooking off a giardia 
of  stars, the dregs of our night- 
mares. Who will place his fingers 
in the nailmarks, come near enough 
to smell death in its hair? Already we’ve 
some of us slid back into our bodies, 
restirring the air our breaths stirred 
all night — whoever we are while 
we sleep — and gone about believing 
we are here. Ambulance sirens 
assure us, a plum’s sour skin, what’s become 
of  the poppies, dried all but greenless, 
etcetera. But the yearling child 
reaching into the lineaments of  sun 
lancing between his crib bars — how might 
this shame us, that they seem 
to seem graspable to him?

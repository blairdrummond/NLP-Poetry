title : Where Are The Stars Pristine

Everyone's spending Christmas Eve adrift 
in the corporal skirmish, mixing 
up the darks with the lights, fending 
with elbows and dirty 
looks. Wet wool and down 
crowd the air. Where are the stars, pristine 
as great ideas? Behind clouds 
the heavens saturate 
with luminous dust, shuttles wearing halos 
of earthdirt, light pollution 
from jets fired to keep things 
on course. Boys rickrack a ball off 
floor and ceiling past the table 
tree bubbling with giveaway 
ornaments from Burger King and lights 
that manage an occasional 
lackadaisical flash. Showstoppers: everyone 

looks every time and keeps looking 
to make sure it happened. 
The double frontloaders are going 
like abstract TVs. And the program is important: 
all about the boggling sullied 
lives we'd like to hide. 
But this is no place 
to do so, where known 
and unknown perverts come 
to pirate underpants and the innocent 
clutch their Cheer and Shout. 
The rules are posted: only the toughest 
habiliments, the superego 
of raiment can take such agitation. 
And only the poor are invited to endure 
the sneezy powders and clean resentment. 

Imagine a museum installationâ€” 
200 hypnotic washers stuffed with somersaulting 
cloth. Critics could rise to the challenge, 
their statements settling like coats 
of gold and silver 
chain mail over each machine: 
"These Speed Queen pieces thrust ahead of art- 
for-art's sake to confront us 
with a realism of socio-political 
magnitude. The vortex-like movement 
of pattern, color, and texture infuses 
these works with an abundance of unconscious 
bliss. The soft forms 
circulate with vigor 
across the screens. The viewer 
is not privy 
to the cause of dirt 
though one is witness to the dirt's 
ablutions. The point is 
we are not impeccable." 

Everyone would be happy 
to know that! And so we're forced to 
scoop and pour 
a fine white empathy over 
the hairy flannels, snaggy nylons, 
the glass front that gives 
forth this light 
industry, the silly tree 
and jingles about blue and white 
Christmases, chestnuts, sleighbells, 
just as snow settles 
on every unsequestered thing: 

from blistered gum - 
ball machines, clumsy bumpers, 
crepuscular theaters with sticky floors, 
to ramshackle mansions 
choked with smiling 
china animals where light shakes itself out 
from TVs and old women 
frail as walking sticks 
sweep their stoops at eight a.m. 
Just as snow makes the less than impeccable 
classical, stroking the merely 
drab or passing, quickly or slowly, 
so we can count only on its 
leaving, teaching 
liquidity 
to what seems solid.

title : Calling Him Back from Layoff

author : Bob Hicok

text : 
I called a man today. After he said
 hello and I said hello came a pause
 during which it would have been
  
 confusing to say hello again so I said
 how are you doing and guess what, he said
 fine and wondered aloud how I was
  
 and it turns out I’m OK. He
 was on the couch watching cars
 painted with ads for Budweiser follow cars
  
 painted with ads for Tide around an oval
 that’s a metaphor for life because
 most of us run out of gas and settle
  
 for getting drunk in the stands
 and shouting at someone in a t-shirt
 we want kraut on our dog. I said
  
 he could have his job back and during
 the pause that followed his whiskers
 scrubbed the mouthpiece clean
  
 and his breath passed in and out
 in the tidal fashion popular
 with mammals until he broke through
  
 with the words how soon thank you
 ohmyGod which crossed his lips and drove
 through the wires on the backs of ions
  
 as one long word as one hard prayer
 of relief meant to be heard
 by the sky. When he began to cry I tried
  
 with the shape of my silence to say
 I understood but each confession
 of fear and poverty was more awkward
  
 than what you learn in the shower.
 After he hung up I went outside and sat
 with one hand in the bower of the other
  
 and thought if I turn my head to the left
 it changes the song of the oriole
 and if I give a job to one stomach other
  
 forks are naked and if tonight a steak
 sizzles in his kitchen do the seven
 other people staring at their phones
  
 hear?

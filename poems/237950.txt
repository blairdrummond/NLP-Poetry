title : Common Dust

author : Georgia Douglas Johnson

text : 
And who shall separate the dust 
What later we shall be: 
Whose keen discerning eye will scan 
And solve the mystery?

The high, the low, the rich, the poor,  
The black, the white, the red,  
And all the chromatique between,  
Of whom shall it be said:

Here lies the dust of Africa;  
Here are the sons of Rome;  
Here lies the one unlabelled,  
The world at large his home!

Can one then separate the dust?  
Will mankind lie apart,  
When life has settled back again  
The same as from the start?

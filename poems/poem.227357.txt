Imagery, Common Measure

It was not Death, for I stood up, 
And all the Dead, lie down - 
It was not Night, for all the Bells 
Put out their Tongues, for Noon. 

It was not Frost, for on my Flesh 
I felt Siroccos - crawl -
Nor Fire - for just my marble feet 
Could keep a Chancel, cool - 

And yet, it tasted, like them all, 
The Figures I have seen 
Set orderly, for Burial 
Reminded me, of mine - 

As if my life were shaven,
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key, 
And 'twas like Midnight, some -

When everything that ticked - has stopped -
And space stares - all around -
Or Grisly frosts - first Autumn morns,
Repeal the Beating Ground -

But most, like Chaos - Stopless - cool - 
Without a Chance, or spar -
Or even a Report of Land -
To justify - Despair.

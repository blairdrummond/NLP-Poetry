To one who has been long in city pent, 
         'Tis very sweet to look into the fair 
         And open face of heaven,--to breathe a prayer 
Full in the smile of the blue firmament. 
Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, 
         Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair 
         Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair 
And gentle tale of love and languishment? 
Returning home at evening, with an ear 
         Catching the notes of Philomel,--an eye 
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, 
         He mourns that day so soon has glided by: 
E'en like the passage of an angel's tear 
         That falls through the clear ether silently.

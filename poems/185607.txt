title : From Her Notes

My last Sabbath, 
I follow the girls, who sneak into 
the wedding 

tent, scattered with sun 
flower seeds and remnants of 
celebration. They 

each stand up on a   
table. Take a crushed beer can 
as a microphone, 

sing and move their 
fifteen-year-old hips. I watch, 
clap for them, until 

a small face peers in 
the door. A boy. His face white 
with something. The door 

slamming, his very small 
fist holding it shut, having 
found what was inside 

wrong. Enough, I tell 
him; enough! He leaves. The girls 
dance again, but less 

bold. Look: the boy 
has come back, is looking you 
hard in the eye, through 

the crack of the door. 
There, in his hand, a neon 
plastic BB 

gun. He does this for 
his grandmother and for his 
son.

title : Erstwhile Harbinger Auspices

author : Matthew Zapruder

Erstwhile means long time gone.
 A harbinger is sent before to help,
 and also a sign of things
 to come. Like this blue
 stapler I bought at Staples.
 Did you know in ancient Rome
 priests called augurs studied
 the future by carefully watching
 whether birds were flying
 together or alone, making what
 honking or beeping noises
 in what directions? It was called
 the auspices. The air
 was thus a huge announcement.
 Today itâ€™s completely 
 transparent, a vase. Inside it
 flowers flower. Thus
 a little death scent. I have 
 no master but always wonder,
 what is making my master sad?
 Maybe I do not know him.
 This morning I made extra coffee
 for the beloved and covered 
 the cup with a saucer. Skeleton
 I thought, and stay
 very still, whatever it was 
 will soon pass by and be gone.

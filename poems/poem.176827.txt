Ballad, Rhymed Stanza

Well I recall my Father's wife, 
      The day he brought her home. 
His children looked for years of strife, 
      And troubles sure to come-- 
Ungraciously we welcomed her, 
      A thing to scorn and blame; 
And swore we never would confer 
      On her, a Mother's name 

I see her yet--a girl in years, 
      With eyes so blue and mild; 
She greeted us with smiles and tears, 
      How sweetly too she smiled-- 
She bent to kiss my sullen brow, 
      With woman's gentle grace; 
And laid her tiny hand of snow 
      On my averted face-- 

"Henry--is this your son? She said-- 
      "Dear boy--he now is mine-- 
What not one kiss?--" I shook my head, 
      "I am no son of thine!--" 
She sighed--and from her dimpled cheek 
      The rosy colour fled; 
She turned away and did not speak, 
      My thoughts were with the dead-- 

There leaped from out my Father's eyes 
      A jet of swarthy fire; 
That flashed on me in fierce surprise-- 
      I fled before his ire 
I heard her gentle voice entreat-- 
      "Forgiveness for her sake"-- 
Which added swiftness to my feet, 
      A sad and strange mistake-- 

A year had scarcely rolled away 
      When by that hated bride; 
I loved to linger half the day, 
      In very joy and pride; 
Her voice was music to mine ear, 
      So soft its accent fell; 
"Dear Mother now"--and oh, how dear 
      No words of mine can tell-- 

She was so gentle, fair and kind, 
      So pure in soul and free from art; 
That woman with her noble mind, 
      Subdued my rebel heart-- 
I just had learned to know her worth, 
      My Father's second choice to bless; 
When God removed her from the earth, 
      And plunged us all in deep distress-- 

Hot fever smote with burning blight 
      Stretchd on a restless bed of pain; 
I moaning lay from morn till night 
      With aching limbs and throbbing brain-- 
Four weary weeks beside my bed, 
      She sat within a darkened room; 
Untiring held my aching head, 
      Nor heeded silence--cold and gloom-- 

And when my courage quite gave way, 
      And fainter grew my struggling breath; 
She taught my stricken soul to pray 
      And calmly meet approaching death-- 
"Fear not God's angel, sent by Him, 
      The weary spirit to release; 
Before the mortal eyes grow dim, 
      Floats down the white winged dove of peace"-- 

There came a change--but fingers small, 
      No longer smoothed my matted hair; 
She sprang not to my feeble call, 
      Nor helped to lift me to my chair-- 
And I arose as from the dead, 
      A life for her dear life was given; 
The angel who had watched my bed 
      Had vanished into Heaven!--

title : Escaped Housewife Prefers the Term Cosmetologist

author : Karen Craigo

text : 
Quasi-scientific? Maybe. 
But think of beautician, 
a word that assumes loveliness 
is brought off by technology. 

She prefers cosmetologist— 
how it seems to have something 
to do with the stars. She believes 
she can see the future 
when she stares face-down 
at the globe of a stranger's scalp 
and adjusts the tilt of his head. 

At the Academy, she is learning 
about the tendencies of things 
to remain where they fall. 
She knows some tricks— 
spritz and gel, the so-called 
permanent wave. She wonders 
where they come from, 
this galaxy of dowdy customers. 

Some days her precision cuts 
hang like torn drapes 
on a dirty window. 
I see you've tried 
an asymmetrical look, 
her instructor might say, 
snipping corrections. 
At the Academy, asymmetrical 
is spelled with a D. 

She came here to verify 
what she always suspected: 
that straight hair must be curled, 
curly hair straightened, 
long hair cut, short hair extended. 
That what comes to us by fate 
is wrong.

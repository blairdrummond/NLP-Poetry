title : Old Bones

author : Gary Snyder

text : 
Out there walking round, looking out for food,
 a rootstock, a birdcall, a seed that you can crack
 plucking, digging, snaring, snagging,
          barely getting by,
  
 no food out there on dusty slopes of scree—
 carry some—look for some,
 go for a hungry dream.
 Deer bone, Dall sheep,
          bones hunger home.
  
 Out there somewhere
 a shrine for the old ones,
 the dust of the old bones,
          old songs and tales.
  
 What we ate—who ate what—
          how we all prevailed.

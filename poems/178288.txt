title : An Awful Story

author : Michael Collier

text : 
When she came into his room he was asleep   
and when she touched him, he woke— 
her hand on his shoulder, her knee at his mouth,   
and in the darkness, she looked like a boy. 

When he tried to sit up she covered his ears   
with her hands: “Save ourselves from ourselves,”   
she said, and then a wind stirred in the room   
as if she’d placed those words in his mouth.

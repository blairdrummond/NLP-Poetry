title : Rat Song

author : Margaret Atwood

text : 
When you hear me singing 
you get the rifle down 
and the flashlight, aiming for my brain,   
but you always miss 

and when you set out the poison   
I piss on it 
to warn the others. 

You think: That one’s too clever,   
she’s dangerous, because 
I don’t stick around to be slaughtered   
and you think I’m ugly too 
despite my fur and pretty teeth   
and my six nipples and snake tail.   
All I want is love, you stupid   
humanist. See if you can. 

Right, I’m a parasite, I live off your   
leavings, gristle and rancid fat,   
I take without asking 
and make nests in your cupboards   
out of your suits and underwear.   
You’d do the same if you could, 

if you could afford to share   
my crystal hatreds. 
It’s your throat I want, my mate   
trapped in your throat. 
Though you try to drown him   
with your greasy person voice, 
he is hiding / between your syllables   
I can hear him singing.

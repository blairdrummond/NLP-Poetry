title : Poem to an Unnameable Man

author : Dorothea Lasky

text : 
You have changed me already. I am a fireball
 That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
 You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball
 That is throwing sparks upon your face
 Oh look at them shake
 Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
 O too this is so dramatic this shaking
 Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
 So you ran and hid
 Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think
 That tree although soon she will wither
 Into ten black snakes upon your throat
 And when she does I will be wandering as I always am
 A graceful lady that is part museum
 Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
 I will hold your voice in a little box
 And when you come upon me I won’t look back at you
 You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back
 Into the heart from where it came from
 And I will not cry also
 Although you will expect me to
 I was wiser too than you had expected
 For I knew all along you were mine

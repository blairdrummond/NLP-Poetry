Where was it that we went that night?
 That long, low building: floodlights
 rimmed in lavender, the moon ringed
 in rose. I would rather, then, have stayed
  
 outside, where spiderwebs glowed
 like jellyfish in the damp yew hedges,
 where the paths were chalky pebbles
 set with giant stepping stones.
  
 But the film was starting. In the air-
 conditioned dark, a crowd of strangers,
 strange families (not from our church)
 in rows of metal folding chairs to see
  
 a man quartered by horses: strain
 stitched across his shining back
 then, all over at once, an unraveling
 and then the spill of meat;
  
 a girl pushed through a doorway,
 naked among soldiers:
 she grew a dress to cover herself,
 a blue dress with a blinding sash.

Fragment 2: I know 'tis but a Dream, yet feel more anguish 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
1772-1834
Romantic
England
Sorrow & Grieving, Living



I know 'tis but a Dream, yet feel more anguish
Than if 'twere Truth. It has been often so:
Must I die under it? Is no one near?
Will no one hear these stifled groans and wake me?

text : 
Years later they find themselves talking   
about chances, moments when their lives   
might have swerved off 
for the smallest reason. 
                                     What if 
I hadn’t phoned, he says, that morning?   
What if you’d been out, 
as you were when I tried three times   
the night before? 
                           Then she tells him a secret.   
She’d been there all evening, and she knew   
he was the one calling, which was why   
she hadn’t answered. 
                               Because she felt— 
because she was certain—her life would change   
if she picked up the phone, said hello,   
said, I was just thinking 
of you. 
            I was afraid, 
she tells him. And in the morning   
I also knew it was you, but I just   
answered the phone 
                            the way anyone 
answers a phone when it starts to ring,   
not thinking you have a choice.

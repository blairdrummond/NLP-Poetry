Couplet, Rhymed Stanza

Pavement slipp'ry, people sneezing, 
Lords in ermine, beggars freezing; 
Titled gluttons dainties carving, 
Genius in a garret starving. 

Lofty mansions, warm and spacious; 
Courtiers cringing and voracious; 
Misers scarce the wretched heeding; 
Gallant soldiers fighting, bleeding. 

Wives who laugh at passive spouses; 
Theatres, and meeting-houses; 
Balls, where simp'ring misses languish; 
Hospitals, and groans of anguish. 

Arts and sciences bewailing; 
Commerce drooping, credit failing; 
Placemen mocking subjects loyal; 
Separations, weddings royal. 

Authors who can't earn a dinner; 
Many a subtle rogue a winner; 
Fugitives for shelter seeking; 
Misers hoarding, tradesmen breaking. 

Taste and talents quite deserted; 
All the laws of truth perverted; 
Arrogance o'er merit soaring; 
Merit silently deploring. 

Ladies gambling night and morning; 
Fools the works of genius scorning; 
Ancient dames for girls mistaken, 
Youthful damsels quite forsaken. 

Some in luxury delighting; 
More in talking than in fighting; 
Lovers old, and beaux decrepid; 
Lordlings empty and insipid. 

Poets, painters, and musicians; 
Lawyers, doctors, politicians: 
Pamphlets, newspapers, and odes, 
Seeking fame by diff'rent roads. 

Gallant souls with empty purses; 
Gen'rals only fit for nurses; 
School-boys, smit with martial spirit, 
Taking place of vet'ran merit. 

Honest men who can't get places, 
Knaves who shew unblushing faces; 
Ruin hasten'd, peace retarded; 
Candor spurn'd, and art rewarded.

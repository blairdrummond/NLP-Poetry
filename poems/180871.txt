Kiss’d yestreen, and kiss’d yestreen,
Up the Gallowgate, down the Green:
I’ve woo’d wi’ lords, and woo’d wi’ lairds,
I’ve mool’d wi carles and mell’d wi’ cairds,
I’ve kiss’d wi’ priests— ‘twas done i’ the dark,
Twice in my gown and thrice in my sark;
But priest, nor lord, nor loon can gie
Sic kindly kisses as he gae me.

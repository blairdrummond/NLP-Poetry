Love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.                                                                        CAMUS
All day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch.
 Screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened
 keep the whole house tormented. He is trying to reach
 the bees, he is after bees. This is the climax, an end
 to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.

 Last June on the porch floor I found them dead,
 a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse
 death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,
 I swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,
 I thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?

 My life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. The search
 was hopeless. Windows were shut. I never find
 where anything comes from. But in June my husband’s fierce
 sallies began, inspections, cracks located
 and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ course
  
 watched, charted; books on bees read.
 I tell you I swept up bodies every day on the porch.
 Then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,
 as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech
 sleepers who live innocently in will and mind. 
  
 It is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers
 that the bees were back, no surprise to me. But they had 
 left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs
 so deathly faded. Gray bugs that the broom hunted
 were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch
  
 of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.
 November it came to an end. No bees. And I could watch 
 the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.
 But this spring the thing began again, and his curse
 went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.
  
 It is the man who takes hold. I lived from bees, but his force
 went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.
 And now in July he is tearing out the wall, and each
 board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.
 It is quiet, has been quiet for a while. He calls me, and I march
  
 from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,
 such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers—
 dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared
 together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?
 They go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.
  
 But there is more. Wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered
 enough? This evening we go to a party, the breeze 
 dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.
 We tell our funny story about the bees.
 At two in the morning we come home, and a friend,
  
 a scientist, comes with us, in his car. We’re going to save
 the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find
 so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave
 the rest. We hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,
 taking no note of these private catastrophes.
  
 He wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. Not a bad
 thing to look into. In the night we rattle and raise 
 the lid of the garbage can. Flashlights in hand,
 we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve
 of happenings. I can’t touch it. I hate the self-examined
  
 who’ve killed the self. The dead are darker, but the others have
 moved in the ooze toward the next moment. My God
 one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.
 Searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need
 the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze
  
 for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.
 The men do it. Making a claim on the future, as love
 makes a claim on the future, grasping. And I, underhand,
 I feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave
 taking direction. Unpleading, the men prod
  
 till all that grubby softness wants to give, to give.

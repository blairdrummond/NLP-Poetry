                         I 

When moiling seems at cease 
       In the vague void of night-time, 
       And heaven's wide roomage stormless 
       Between the dusk and light-time, 
       And fear at last is formless, 
We call the allurement Peace. 

                         II 

Peace, this hid riot, Change, 
       This revel of quick-cued mumming, 
       This never truly being, 
       This evermore becoming, 
       This spinner's wheel onfleeing 
Outside perception's range.

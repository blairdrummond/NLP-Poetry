title : Incision

author : Jillian Weise

text : 
The nape of my neck is a tell. 
Otherwise you wouldn't notice 
with the layers of clothes: shirt, 
vest, scarf, coat. 

Undressed, it's a solitary hole 
in the middle of a white wall, you   
can't help but stare, what picture 
hung there, what of, what color? 

It gets worse than this, you'll 
want to see how far down it goes. 
The circular incision top and bottom, 
a line contained by points.   

The seal of an envelope, opened.

title : Nightmare Begins Responsibility

author : Michael S. Harper

text : 
I place these numbed wrists to the pane   
watching white uniforms whisk over 
him in the tube-kept 
prison 
fear what they will do in experiment 
watch my gloved stickshifting gasolined hands   
breathe boxcar-information-please infirmary tubes   
distrusting white-pink mending paperthin   
silkened end hairs, distrusting tubes 
shrunk in his trunk-skincapped 
shaven head, in thighs   
distrusting-white-hands-picking-baboon-light  
on his son who will not make his second night   
of this wardstrewn intensive airpocket   
where his father's asthmatic 
hymns of night-train, train done gone 
his mother can only know that he has flown   
up into essential calm unseen corridor 
going boxscarred home, mamaborn, sweetsonchild  
gonedowntown into researchtestingwarehousebatteryacid 
mama-son-done-gone/me telling her 'nother   
train tonight, no music, no breathstroked   
heartbeat in my infinite distrust of them: 

and of my distrusting self   
white-doctor-who-breathed-for-him-all-night  
say it for two sons gone, 
say nightmare, say it loud 
panebreaking heartmadness: 
nightmare begins responsibility.

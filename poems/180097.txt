I am writing this poem 
               about the 1965 massacre 
      of Indonesians by Indonesians 

which in an article ten years later 
               I could not publish 
      except in Nottingham England with 

a friend Malcolm Caldwell who has since 
               himself been murdered 
      no one will say by whom but I will guess 

seeing as this is 
               precisely poetry 
      the CIA's and now Peking's Cambodian 

assassins the Khmer Serai 
               In that article I estimated 
      a half-million or more 

killed in this period 
               it took Noam in a book 
      suppressed by its first publisher 

to quote Admiral Sudomo 
               of the Indonesian junta 
    more than 500,000 

and now Amnesty International 
                many more than one million 
      so much for my balanced prose 

But none of us experienced 
               that pervasive smell of death 
      those impassable rivers 

clogged with corpses 
               Robert Lowell is that why 
      even you a pacifist 

had so little to say about it? 
               Or you gentle reader 
      let us examine carefully 

the good reasons 
               you and I 
      don't enjoy reading this 

Like the time 
               in the steep Engadine 
      we saw the silent avalanche 

fall away from the mountain 
               hair and eyebrows 
      the first to feel 

the murmurations 
               of the spreading 
      killer wind 

                  IV.i 

Mégève   coming down 
         beside a rainbow 
   into a shower 

glissade 1000 meters 
         on wet grass 
   laughter at falling safe 

think   married a Venezuelan 
         and lives near Lausanne 
   tell me now you 

with homes in the mountains 
         who are at hand 
   and know all things 

where we hear only rumor 
         of the captains 
   at Bilderberg meetings 

one has to sound 
         like a John Bircher to talk about 
   between the Rockefellers 

the Agnellis and the Rothschilds 
         at whose Megeve resort 
   we were lodged in uncomfrtable 

luxury as delegates 
         to the International Student Service 
   Bilderberg meetings 

supplying Prince Bernhard with 
         an almost unrivalled network 
   not just for the European Movement 

financed with German counterpart funds 
         but also for the recruitment 
   of old intelligence contacts 

as conduits for Lockheed payoffs 
         through the Temperate Zone 
   Research Foundation 

for Antelope Cobbler the Italian premier 
         which supplimented the CIA's 
   financial support 

to parties canidates 
         and incumbent leaders 
   of almost every political persuasion 

and under Sukarno 
         which is why I am telling all this -- 
   not just recalling 

the swampy fields 
         around the Rockefeller lodge 
   in the Connecticut valley 

where the Liberty Lobby discovered 
         the Bilderbergers in '67 -- 
   Jakarta payments deflected 

four months before the coup 
         at legal risks to Lockheed 
   towards the very wealthy 

General Alamsjah 
         epitome of 
   the military entrepreneur 

whom a Lockheed memo 
         called the second man 
   the coup made at once 

funds available to Suharto 
         a Lockheed web 
   extending from Geneva to Jakarta 

millions to Japanese officials 
         where every move made 
   was approved by Washington 

the money through Deak 
         back to Shig Katayama 
   in the Cayman Islands

         Castle Bank in the Bahamas 
   Helliwell narcotics CIA 

the name Richard M. Nixon on the list 
         It was at a Bilderberg 
   meeting that Prince Bernhard 

was introduced by Baron 
         Edmond de Rothschild 
   to Tibor Rosenbaum of the ICB 

the International Credit Bank 
         (later exposed by the Baron 
   after the Vesco coup 

as a source of secret funds 
         for the Mossad 
   Israel's intelligence service 

and one of the country's primary 
         weapons brokers) 
   and whose colleague Ed Levinson 

was the power behind 
         the Havana Riviera 
   and the Serv-U Corporation 

of the Bobby Baker payoffs 
         which began to be exposed 
   in November 1963 -- 

My book would have asked 
         as the Warren Commission staff 
   working for Allen Dulles 

was unable to 
         why Levinson's pit-boss 
   McWillie gambler and murderer 

from the old Binion gang 
         in Dallas and Fort Worth 
   who had a fix with Mr. Big 

I don't think we'd better 
         go into that phase of it 
   twice brought to Havana 

most likely as a courier 
         his close friend 
   Jack Ruby 

A dumb subject 
         The book went into galleys 
   and was photographed 

for the Pocket Books spring catalogue 
         but never published 
   freeing me 

to write this poem 
         Do you remember   yes 
   just for an instant 

the sun warm on our shoulders 
         and beyond the mists 
   rising from the meadow 

Mont Blanc 

                     IV.ii 

From the Bay Bridge   
          on the way home from the opera 
   you could look down on the searchlights 

of the Oakland Army Terminal 
          where they loaded the containers 
   of pellet-bombs and napalm 

into black Japanese ships 
          over which the cranes 
   bent like anxious surgeons 

in the calm and glassy night 
          People of good will 
   of whom at first there were many 

were willing to sign petitions 
          or to help in drafting 
   the letter to the Times 

about how six months 
          they had moved from true to false 
   reports of the North Vietnamese 

negotiating position 
          that the letter never published 
   and the music changing 

bonfires to still the streets 
          the first smudges of tear gas 
   the Yellow Submarine 

(acid in Bir Sur 
          Allen kneeling to pray 
   for Johnson's health) 

at the rock poetry festival 
          no sensations from my first joint 
   except for the difference 

between the salt and pepper 
          I felt being shaken 
   on my bare left arm 

Owsley by parachute 
          at the Human Be-in 
   Mika on Carole's shoulders 

one mine so they could see 
          the Brave New World 
   worms in the rose 

the party's hostess 
          some new drug in the basement 
   crying like a child 

CIA personnel 
          helping local chemists 
   set up LCD labs 

in the Bay Area 
          to monitor events 
   STP Serenity 

from Dow Chemical 
          and the Edgewood Arsenal 
   like being shot out of a gun 

men with their Sunday morning 
          rifle range target practice 
   Black Panthers Ku Klux Klan 

women who shyly hinted 
          at ineffable orgies 
   of acid nakedness 

Ed Sanders the Fugs 
          investigative poetics 
   Out demons out 

with no respect whatsoever 
          for the unassailable logic 
   of the next step 

two hundred pounds of daisies 
          from Peggy Hitchcock 
   to skybomb the Pentagon 

Fort Funston Beach 
          the Barb's first nude-in 
   under the fixed gaze of the mounted police 

dunes of iceplants and callas 
          linnets in the sun and mist 
   (To shoot a policeman 

is a sacred act) 
          the women in seaweed and surf 
   wading as if to be washed 

as clean as seals 

                        IV.viii 

Clifford Geertz having just 
          reread your Notes 
   on the Balinese cockfight 

how you were first accepted 
          by cautious villagers 
   after you all fled 

from the Javanese constabulary 
          and how slaughter 
   in the cock ring itself 

after red pepper 
          is stuffed down their beaks 
   and up their anuses 

joins pride to selfhood 
          selfhood to cocks 
   and cocks to destruction 

a blood sacrifice 
          offered to the demons 
   to pacify their cannibal hunger 

depicting how things are among men 
          not literally but almost worse 
   imaginatively 

what it says is 
          it is of these emotions 
   that society is built 

and of the combat 
          between terrible witch Rangda 
   her eyes bulging like boils 

and the endearing monster Barong 
          a clash between the malignant 
   and the ridiculous 

It is not your belief in men 
          every last one of them are cultural artifacts 
   that I now question 

or even that the imposition 
           of meaning on life 
   is the major end of human existence 

that Virgilian flourish 
          in your footnote to Max Weber 
   but your recurring interpretations 

of the Balinese massacre 
          after what you choose to call 
   the bungled coup and its savage aftermath 

My complaint is not 
          of your early field project 
   for Ford and the CIA-funded 

Center at MIT 
          in which you preceded Pauker 
   or your commissioned study 

on which local elites 
          would best play a role 
   in Rostow's pre-take-off period 

I will not cast that stone 
          from this front window 
   of the world's largest weapons lab 

you who know about 
          puputan and Tjalonarang 
   have the right to recall 

the fact of the massacre 
          through the medium of the cockfight 
   the theatricality of trance 

but why did you write 
          several hundred thousand 
   people were massacred 

largely villagers by other villagers 
          though there were some 
   army executions as well 

when even Shaplen admits 
          the murders in Bali 
   did not start until early December 

that is until after 
          Colonel Edhie's commandos 
   with unit-names like Dracula 

had finished in East Java 
          the army began it 
   then handed the job over to the Balinese 

that is to the special teams 
          set up under Nasution's 
   and Suharto's orders 

and finally stopped the bloodletting 
          as the smell of burning houses 
   overpowered the customary 

fragrance of the rich island flora 
          Clifford Geertz sometimes 
   the world is not as mysterious 

as you and I might wish 
          why can you not write 
   as straightforwardly as Time 

about the land to which you returned 
          on a junta visa 
   and how can you write 

about the integrative revolution 
          in a book that is indexed 
   to sixty-one countries 

Paraguay the Soviet Union 
but not the United States? 

               IV.ix 

When some toys from the West 
          where stolen out of the back seat 
   of our Peugeot in Saska Kepa 

I went without thinking   
          to the Warsaw police 
   A moustached officer 

wrote down everything 
          I had to say 
   which was very little 

and then asked me 
          Was the door locked? 
   I said I had no idea 

probably not and he said 
          Prosze Pana excuse me 
   but it would be good in the future 

to keep your doors locked 
          Our children are not used 
   to seeing toys from the west 

and you do not want 
          to encourage them in crime 
   those Sunday walks with 

Cassie in her blue pram 
          the well-dressed housewives 
   offering in illegal dollars 

twice what we paid for it 
          I told the officer 
   I was withdrawing my complaint 

He smiled and began to talk 
          about his life as a policeman 
   how much easier it had been 

after Stalin had died 
          in those days no one 
   wanted to talk to us 

even our own children 
          sometimes mistrusting us 
   despite what they learned at school 

We talked for two hours 
          and I think of him often 
   as I read in the papers 

of Solidarnosc suppressed 
          how those must be 
   privileged moments 

one can so transcend history 
          how today he would not dare 
   to have such a conversation 

nor I have the heart 
          And yet those two hours 
   in that ill-furnished precinct 

seem somehow more true 
          than the street battles since 
   My own life is easier 

no longer having to be consul 
          I suspect that on our side 
   officials of U.S. Steel 

             IV.xvii 

And now East Timor 
          where in 1977 
   the Indonesian minister admits 

perhaps 80,000 might have been killed 
          that is to say one person out of eight 
   by his own government's paracommandos 

these gentle midnight faces 
          the beetles which crowd their eyes 
   From 1975 to 1977 

the New York Times index 
          entries for East Timor 
   dropped from six columns 

to five lines

This circle holding the afternoon sky is a lake 
For summer business measured in stacked pairs 
Of peeling oars whose dinghies all ship water. 
Beside it on the trampled grass a carrousel shakes 
And turns on an Old World instrument 
The plink and plank and tinkle of a tune 
Of plunging horses in fresh habiliment. 
We catch the reins of enamel Pegasus 
And lift the child until she is astride 
A purple beast, where, wrapping infant arms 
About his neck of wood, she whirls in space 
And gallops off upon the turning wheel. 
The horse climbs steadily the silver pole
Where cherubs hang, then slides toward spinning earth; 
She sees the moving heaven of winged babes; 
Rising to meet them, rising, she returns 
To where our faces, staring in at hers, 
Fixed, while her orbit whirls and sunlight burns, 
Recede to artifact as her vision blurs.

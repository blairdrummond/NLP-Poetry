I 
Beyond the hollow sunset, ere a star 
Take heart in heaven from eastward, while the west, 
Fulfilled of watery resonance and rest, 
Is as a port with clouds for harbour bar 
To fold the fleet in of the winds from far 
That stir no plume now of the bland sea's breast: 

II 
Above the soft sweep of the breathless bay 
Southwestward, far past flight of night and day, 
Lower than the sunken sunset sinks, and higher 
Than dawn can freak the front of heaven with fire, 
My thought with eyes and wings made wide makes way 
To find the place of souls that I desire. 

III 
If any place for any soul there be, 
Disrobed and disentrammelled; if the might, 
The fire and force that filled with ardent light 
The souls whose shadow is half the light we see, 
Survive and be suppressed not of the night; 
This hour should show what all day hid from me. 

IV 
Night knows not, neither is it shown to day, 
By sunlight nor by starlight is it shown, 
Nor to the full moon's eye nor footfall known, 
Their world's untrodden and unkindled way. 
Nor is the breath nor music of it blown 
With sounds of winter or with winds of May. 

V 
But here, where light and darkness reconciled 
Held earth between them as a weanling child 
Between the balanced hands of death and birth, 
Even as they held the new-born shape of earth 
When first life trembled in her limbs and smiled, 
Here hope might think to find what hope were worth. 

VI 
Past Hades, past Elysium, past the long 
Slow smooth strong lapse of Lethe--past the toil 
Wherein all souls are taken as a spoil, 
The Stygian web of waters--if your song 
Be quenched not, O our brethren, but be strong 
As ere ye too shook off our temporal coil; 

VII 
If yet these twain survive your worldly breath, 
Joy trampling sorrow, life devouring death, 
If perfect life possess your life all through 
And like your words your souls be deathless too, 
To-night, of all whom night encompasseth, 
My soul would commune with one soul of you. 

VIII 
Above the sunset might I see thine eyes 
That were above the sundawn in our skies, 
Son of the songs of morning,--thine that were 
First lights to lighten that rekindling air 
Wherethrough men saw the front of England rise 
And heard thine loudest of the lyre-notes there-- 

IX 
If yet thy fire have not one spark the less, 
O Titan, born of her a Titaness, 
Across the sunrise and the sunset's mark 
Send of thy lyre one sound, thy fire one spark, 
To change this face of our unworthiness, 
Across this hour dividing light from dark. 

X 
To change this face of our chill time, that hears 
No song like thine of all that crowd its ears, 
Of all its lights that lighten all day long 
Sees none like thy most fleet and fiery sphere's 
Outlightening Sirius--in its twilight throng 
No thunder and no sunrise like thy song. 

XI 
Hath not the sea-wind swept the sea-line bare 
To pave with stainless fire through stainless air 
A passage for thine heavenlier feet to tread 
Ungrieved of earthly floor-work? hath it spread 
No covering splendid as the sun-god's hair 
To veil or to reveal thy lordlier head? 

XII 
Hath not the sunset strewn across the sea 
A way majestical enough for thee? 
What hour save this should be thine hour--and mine, 
If thou have care of any less divine 
Than thine own soul; if thou take thought of me, 
Marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of thine? 

XIII 
Before the morn's face as before the sun 
The morning star and evening star are one 
For all men's lands as England. O, if night 
Hang hard upon us,--ere our day take flight, 
Shed thou some comfort from thy day long done 
On us pale children of the latter light! 

XIV 
For surely, brother and master and lord and king, 
Where'er thy footfall and thy face make spring 
In all souls' eyes that meet thee wheresoe'er, 
And have thy soul for sunshine and sweet air-- 
Some late love of thine old live land should cling, 
Some living love of England, round thee there. 

XV 
Here from her shore across her sunniest sea 
My soul makes question of the sun for thee, 
And waves and beams make answer. When thy feet 
Made her ways flowerier and their flowers more sweet 
With childlike passage of a god to be, 
Like spray these waves cast off her foemen's fleet. 

XVI 
Like foam they flung it from her, and like weed 
Its wrecks were washed from scornful shoal to shoal, 
From rock to rock reverberate; and the whole 
Sea laughed and lightened with a deathless deed 
That sowed our enemies in her field for seed 
And made her shores fit harbourage for thy soul. 

XVII 
Then in her green south fields, a poor man's child, 
Thou hadst thy short sweet fill of half-blown joy, 
That ripens all of us for time to cloy 
With full-blown pain and passion; ere the wild 
World caught thee by the fiery heart, and smiled 
To make so swift end of the godlike boy. 

XVIII 
For thou, if ever godlike foot there trod 
These fields of ours, wert surely like a god. 
Who knows what splendour of strange dreams was shed 
With sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and red 
From hallowed windows, over stone and sod, 
On thine unbowed bright insubmissive head? 

XIX 
The shadow stayed not, but the splendour stays, 
Our brother, till the last of English days. 
No day nor night on English earth shall be 
For ever, spring nor summer, Junes nor Mays, 
But somewhat as a sound or gleam of thee 
Shall come on us like morning from the sea. 

XX 
Like sunrise never wholly risen, nor yet 
Quenched; or like sunset never wholly set, 
A light to lighten as from living eyes 
The cold unlit close lids of one that lies 
Dead, or a ray returned from death's far skies 
To fire us living lest our lives forget. 

XXI 
For in that heaven what light of lights may be, 
What splendour of what stars, what spheres of flame 
Sounding, that none may number nor may name, 
We know not, even thy brethren; yea, not we 
Whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee, 
Whose ways and thine are one way and the same. 

XXII 
But if the riddles that in sleep we read, 
And trust them not, be flattering truth indeed, 
As he that rose our mightiest called them,--he, 
Much higher than thou as thou much higher than we-- 
There, might we say, all flower of all our seed, 
All singing souls are as one sounding sea. 

XXIII 
All those that here were of thy kind and kin, 
Beside thee and below thee, full of love, 
Full-souled for song,--and one alone above 
Whose only light folds all your glories in-- 
With all birds' notes from nightingale to dove 
Fill the world whither we too fain would win. 

XXIV 
The world that sees in heaven the sovereign light 
Of sunlike Shakespeare, and the fiery night 
Whose stars were watched of Webster; and beneath, 
The twin-souled brethren of the single wreath, 
Grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral heath, 
Wrought with all flowers for all men's heart's delight. 

XXV 
And that fixed fervour, iron-red like Mars, 
In the mid moving tide of tenderer stars, 
That burned on loves and deeds the darkest done, 
Athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house bars; 
And thine, most highest of all their fires but one, 
Our morning star, sole risen before the sun. 

XXVI 
And one light risen since theirs to run such race 
Thou hast seen, O Phosphor, from thy pride of place. 
Thou hast seen Shelley, him that was to thee 
As light to fire or dawn to lightning; me, 
Me likewise, O our brother, shalt thou see, 
And I behold thee, face to glorious face? 

XXVII 
You twain the same swift year of manhood swept 
Down the steep darkness, and our father wept. 
And from the gleam of Apollonian tears 
A holier aureole rounds your memories, kept 
Most fervent-fresh of all the singing spheres, 
And April-coloured through all months and years. 

XXVIII 
You twain fate spared not half your fiery span; 
The longer date fulfils the lesser man. 
Ye from beyond the dark dividing date 
Stand smiling, crowned as gods with foot on fate. 
For stronger was your blessing than his ban, 
And earliest whom he struck, he struck too late. 

XXIX 
Yet love and loathing, faith and unfaith yet 
Bind less to greater souls in unison, 
And one desire that makes three spirits as one 
Takes great and small as in one spiritual net 
Woven out of hope toward what shall yet be done 
Ere hate or love remember or forget. 

XXX 
Woven out of faith and hope and love too great 
To bear the bonds of life and death and fate: 
Woven out of love and hope and faith too dear 
To take the print of doubt and change and fear: 
And interwoven with lines of wrath and hate 
Blood-red with soils of many a sanguine year. 

XXXI 
Who cannot hate, can love not; if he grieve, 
His tears are barren as the unfruitful rain 
That rears no harvest from the green sea's plain, 
And as thorns crackling this man's laugh is vain. 
Nor can belief touch, kindle, smite, reprieve 
His heart who has not heart to disbelieve. 

XXXII 
But you, most perfect in your hate and love, 
Our great twin-spirited brethren; you that stand 
Head by head glittering, hand made fast in hand, 
And underfoot the fang-drawn worm that strove 
To wound you living; from so far above, 
Look love, not scorn, on ours that was your land. 

XXXIII 
For love we lack, and help and heat and light 
To clothe us and to comfort us with might. 
What help is ours to take or give? but ye-- 
O, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea, 
That wailed aloud with all her waves all night, 
Much more, being much more glorious, should you be. 

XXXIV 
As fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew 
To flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain, 
As hope to souls long weaned from hope again 
Returning, or as blood revived anew 
To dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein, 
Even so toward us should no man be but you. 

XXXV 
One rose before the sunrise was, and one 
Before the sunset, lovelier than the sun. 
And now the heaven is dark and bright and loud 
With wind and starry drift and moon and cloud, 
And night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud, 
What help is ours if hope like yours be none? 

XXXVI 
O well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be, 
Then are we not forsaken. This kind earth 
Made fragrant once for all time with your birth, 
And bright for all men with your love, and worth 
The clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea, 
Were not your mother if not your brethren we. 

XXXVII 
Because the days were dark with gods and kings 
And in time's hand the old hours of time as rods, 
When force and fear set hope and faith at odds, 
Ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings; 
And we that front not more disastrous things, 
How should we fail in face of kings and gods? 

XXXVIII 
For now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned 
Surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind 
Whose feet we fledged with morning; and the breath 
Begins in heaven that sings the dark to death. 
And all the night wherein men groaned and sinned 
Sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. 

XXXIX 
O first-born sons of hope and fairest, ye 
Whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded sea 
Whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar 
The spirit of man lest truth should make him free, 
The sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star, 
Take heart as we to know you that ye are. 

XL 
Ye rise not and ye set not; we that say 
Ye rise and set like hopes that set and rise 
Look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay; 
But where at last the sea's line is the sky's 
And truth and hope one sunlight in your eyes, 
No sunrise and no sunset marks their day.

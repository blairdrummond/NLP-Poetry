title : Rumpelstiltskin

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
‘Your name is Rumpelstiltskin!’ cried
The Queen. ‘It’s not,’ he lied. ‘I lied
The time you heard me say it was.’
‘I never heard you. It’s a guess,’

She lied. He lied: ‘My name is Zed.’
She told the truth: ‘You’re turning red,
Zed.’ He said: ‘That’s not my name!’
‘You’re turning red though, all the same.’

‘Liar!’ he cried: ‘I’m turning blue.’
And this was absolutely true.
And then he tore himself in two,
As liars tend to have to do.

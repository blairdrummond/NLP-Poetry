title : [Throwing his life away,]

author : Josephine Miles

text : 
Throwing his life away,
      He picks at and smells it.
      Done up. When did I do this up?
      I date its death to the time someone
      Said something.
      Back then.
      Everything else, all striving, making,
      Marrying, error,
      Is this old bird.

Pah! He throws it.
      As the long string lengthens
      Out of his hand,
      It begins unwinding
      The ligaments of his hand.

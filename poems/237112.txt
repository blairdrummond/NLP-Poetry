title : Early Morning Prompts for Evening Takes Or, Roll ’em!

Like being reassigned to a case being made—to win?

            for a world
            mocked-up—terms
            to contest?

Or, self glutting the market of experience—

            am am, a
            did this that—
            as “voice” script?

Or, reining in the thrusting impulse that’d burst—out!

            and into. . .
            timed pattern
            a male’s—“mine?”

Or, a hyper-local cultural thing—to do—

            conscious stance
            between friends
            strung along?

Or, some gnawing negation—impelling all this?

            din’ wanna
            (really did)
            am “writing?”

Or, being dispatched to a cramped corner of the vast. . .

            work-a-day
            transactions
            transmission?

Or, alibis for (if not from) the near Black Out—

            detecting
            vital signs
            or dissent?

Or, The National—reifying itself—can read?

            preemptive
            authorships
            as “progress”?

Or, a once-elitist practice—popularized—

            aimless youth
            called forth—I
            came (aimed at?)

Or, recombinant ruses of power—“allure”—

            who writes who
            here—and how
            sex—transects?

Or, Capital’s quandaries of identity—

            certified—
            the stakes—now
            lowered? raised?

Or, malingering with History’s inducements—

            disciplined
            we won’t be
            though are—need?

Or, a schedule of vanguardist—occupations—

            vacuum left
            by the left
            to fill out?

Or, the Nors that can’t be stated (just yet) can—mean?

            forming trends
            at the base
            asserting?

Or, wouldn’t non-pop perspectives be also writ?

            discursive
            bumps and grinds
            to report?

Or, logging on to a collectivizing—chance?

            bodies here
            plunked down—will
            plunk up. . . toward?

Or, newly glozed invectives—to desublimate?

            old belles lettres
            upgraded
            downplays gain?

Or, the pervasive liberinage of Genres—

            which clothes which
            strips which—for
            thrills—mostly?

Or, a progressivist (scientistic)—complex?

            regrounding
            the grounds (props
            dignity?

Or, an overdue reunion with precedence—

            compulsion
            to just flake
            kept in check?

Or, why did you come—to hear something you don’t know?

            already—
            sorting terms—
            assigned to?

Or, a realization of what’s yet unrealized—

            postscript or
            preamble
            to praxis?

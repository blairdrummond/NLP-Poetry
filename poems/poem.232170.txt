And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all God's creatures. --KORAN
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell 
   "Whose heart-strings are a lute";   
None sing so wildly well 
As the angel Israfel, 
And the giddy stars (so legends tell),   
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell   
   Of his voice, all mute. 

Tottering above 
   In her highest noon, 
   The enamoured moon 
Blushes with love, 
   While, to listen, the red levin   
   (With the rapid Pleiads, even,   
   Which were seven,) 
   Pauses in Heaven. 

And they say (the starry choir   
   And the other listening things)   
That Israfeli's fire 
Is owing to that lyre 
   By which he sits and sings--   
The trembling living wire 
   Of those unusual strings. 

But the skies that angel trod, 
   Where deep thoughts are a duty,   
Where Love's a grown-up God, 
   Where the Houri glances are   
Imbued with all the beauty 
   Which we worship in a star. 

Therefore, thou art not wrong,   
   Israfeli, who despisest 
An unimpassioned song; 
To thee the laurels belong, 
   Best bard, because the wisest!   
Merrily live, and long! 

The ecstasies above 
   With thy burning measures suit--   
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love, 
   With the fervour of thy lute-- 
   Well may the stars be mute! 

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this 
   Is a world of sweets and sours; 
   Our flowers are merely--flowers,   
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss 
   Is the sunshine of ours. 

If I could dwell 
Where Israfel 
   Hath dwelt, and he where I, 
He might not sing so wildly well 
   A mortal melody, 
While a bolder note than this might swell   
   From my lyre within the sky.

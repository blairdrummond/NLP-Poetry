title : I Flew into Denver April

I flew into Denver April.
 Rock salt and sand peppered the asphalt
 reflecting myself on a downtown street
 where I’d paused on my route to smell lilacs.
 The wanton winds chortled wickedly
 over remnant snows in gray clumps of doom
 and my heart soared gladly at winter’s death
 but an hour later I had whiskey breath
 at a dead end bar full of Indians.
 A Winnebago woman waltzed with me
 and told me how handsome I truly was
 so I bought her drinks and felt her hips
 and somewhere between the grinds
 and dips she lifted my wallet and split.

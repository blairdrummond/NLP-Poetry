title : To Fishermen

author : Carol Frost

text : 
No more savage art: filleting: a deft pressure along the 
       backbone

from tail fan to the red gills: fighting mystery with a 
       honed blade

through the small bones: salt and scales on face and 
       hands:: the Greek God,

as well, found flesh unmysterious, but in anger and
      disappointment:—

seagull cries, your music, are all about you: Apollonian 
       but hungrier: nature is hungry::

the brave fish dies the birds swoop for the insides in no
      lovelier spirals.

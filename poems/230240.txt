a poem in seven parts
1   
convent 

my knees recall the pockets 
worn into the stone floor, 
my hands, tracing against   
the wall their original name, remember 
the cold brush of brick, and the smell   
of the brick powdery and wet 
and the light finding its way in 
through the high bars. 

and also the sisters singing 
at matins, their sweet music 
the voice of the universe at peace   
and the candles their light the light   
at the beginning of creation 
and the wonderful simplicity of prayer   
smooth along the wooden beads   
and certainly attended. 

2 
someone inside me remembers 

that my knees must be hidden away   
that my hair must be shorn 
so that vanity will not test me 
that my fingers are places of prayer 
and are holy that my body is promised   
to something more certain 
than myself 

3   
again 

born in the year of war 
on the day of perpetual help. 

come from the house   
of stillness 
through the soft gate   
of a silent mother. 

come to a betraying father. 
come to a husband who would one day   
rise and enter a holy house. 

come to wrestle with you again,   
passion, old disobedient friend,   
through the secular days and nights   
of another life. 

4 
trying to understand this life 

who did i fail, who 
did i cease to protect 
that i should wake each morning   
facing the cold north? 

perhaps there is a cart   
somewhere in history 
of children crying “sister   
save us” as she walks away. 

the woman walks into my dreams   
dragging her old habit. 
i turn from her, shivering, 
to begin another afternoon 
of rescue, rescue. 

5   
sinnerman 

horizontal one evening   
on the cold stone, 
my cross burning into   
my breast, did i dream   
through my veil 
of his fingers digging 
and is this the dream   
again, him, collarless 
over me, calling me back   
to the stones of this world   
and my own whispered   
hosanna? 

6   
karma 

the habit is heavy.   
you feel its weight 
pulling around your ankles   
for a hundred years. 

the broken vows 
hang against your breasts,   
each bead a word 
that beats you. 

even now 
to hear the words 
defend 
protect 
goodbye 
lost or 
alone 
is to be washed in sorrow. 

and in this life 
there is no retreat   
no sanctuary 
no whole abiding   
sister. 

7 
gloria mundi 

so knowing, 
what is known? 
that we carry our baggage   
in our cupped hands   
when we burst through   
the waters of our mother.   
that some are born 
and some are brought 
to the glory of this world.   
that it is more difficult   
than faith 
to serve only one calling   
one commitment 
one devotion 
in one life.

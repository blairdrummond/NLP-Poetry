text : 
The stars are pinned between the leaves   
of the trees, and love is only a harbinger,   
a regular Boy Scout handbook 
of things not to do, and how to do other things,   
small chores you’d never think of,   
and supper gets cold on the table.   
But I can’t leave here without 
taking you with me. 
And the formal customs we once had,   
like wearing red during hunting season,   
are only signposts pointing the way   
in and out of the territories— 
colored leaves floating on the water,   
hesitant, before the rains come.

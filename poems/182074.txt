title : [I saw him walking along slowly at night]

I saw him walking along slowly at night 
holding a tray of candy and chewing-gum: 
a Jewish boy of fifteen or sixteen 
with large black eyes and a gentle face. 
He sidled into a saloon 
and must have been ordered away 
because he came out promptly 
through the swinging doors. 

I wondered what he was doing 
far from a Jewish neighborhood. 
(I knew the side streets 
and the roughs standing about on the corners and stoops.) 
What a prize this shambling boy with his tray! 
I stepped up to warn him 
against leaving the brightly-lit avenue. 
He listened, eyed me steadily, and walked on calmly. 
I looked at him in astonishment 
and thought: has nothing frightened you? 

Neither the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, by the 
    Romans, by the Crusaders? 
No pogrom in Russia; 
no Nazi death-camp in Germany? 
How can you still go about so calmly?

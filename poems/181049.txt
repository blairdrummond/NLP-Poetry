title : To Find God

author : Robert Herrick

text : 
Weigh me the fire; or canst thou find 
A way to measure out the wind? 
Distinguish all those floods that are 
Mixed in that wat’ry theater, 
And taste thou them as saltless there, 
As in their channel first they were.   
Tell me the people that do keep 
Within the kingdoms of the deep; 
Or fetch me back that cloud again, 
Beshivered into seeds of rain. 
Tell me the motes, dust, sands, and spears 
Of corn, when summer shakes his ears; 
Show me that world of stars, and whence 
They noiseless spill their influence. 
This if thou canst; then show me Him 
That rides the glorious cherubim.

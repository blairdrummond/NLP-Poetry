title : The Blessing of the Old Woman, the Tulip, and the Dog

author : Alicia Ostriker

text : 
To be blessed 
said the old woman 
is to live and work 
so hard 
Godâ€™s love 
washes right through you 
like milk through a cow

To be blessed 
said the dark red tulip 
is to knock their eyes out 
with the slug of lust 
implied by 
your up-ended skirt

To be blessed 
said the dog 
is to have a pinch 
of God 
inside you 
and all the other 
dogs can smell it

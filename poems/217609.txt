title : Frame, An Epistle

Most of the things you made for me—blanket- 
chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker—I gave 
away to friends who could use them and not 
be reminded of the hours lost there, 
not having been witness to those designs, 
the tedious finishes. But I did keep 
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, 
most of these years it has been invisible, 
part of the wall, or defined by reflection— 
safe—because reflection, after all, does change. 
I hung it here in the front, dark hallway 
of this house you will never see, so that 
it might magnify the meager light, 
become a lesser, backward window. No one 
pauses long before it. But this morning, 
as I put on my overcoat, then straightened 
my hair, I saw outside my face its frame 
you made for me, admiring for the first 
time the way the cherry you cut and planed 
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would.

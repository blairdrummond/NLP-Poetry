text : 
I have a yong suster 
Fer beyonden the se, 
Many be the drowryes 
That she sente me. 

She sente me the cherye 
Withouten ony ston;   
And so she dede the dove 
Withouten ony bon. 

She sente me the brer 
Withouten ony rinde; 
She bad me love my lemman 
Withoute longing. 

How shuld ony cherye 
Be withoute ston? 
And how shuld ony dove 
Be withoute bon? 

How shuld ony brer 
Been withoute rinde? 
How shuld I love myn lemman 
Withoute longing? 

Whan the cherye was a flowr 
Than hadde it non ston. 
When the dove was an ey 
Than hadde it non bon. 

When the brer was onbred 
Than hadde it non rind. 
Whan the maiden hath that she loveth 
She is without longing.

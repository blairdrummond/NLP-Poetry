By menopause, it’s not just estrogen
 my mother lacks. She’s lost her eldest son—
 that’s me, the one who’s queer—the doctor who
 once made her very proud. These days, I do
 my own wash when I’m home, I cook for her
 so she can take a break from all the chores
 she now refuses to assign to me. 
 She sits, half-watching Ricki through her tea’s 
 thin steam, her squint of disapproval more 
 denial than it is disgust. She hears
 much better than she sees—it’s easier 
 to keep out vision than it is to clear 
 the air of sounds—and yet I know it’s age 
 that stultifies her senses too. Enraged
 because she’s lost so much, I understand
 why suddenly she looks so stunned 
 as from the television: “. . . Bitch, she stole
 my boyfriend, my own mother did! . . .” I fold
 a towel noiselessly. I know she thinks
 it’s garbage, sinful, crap—just as she thinks
 that taking estrogen in pills is not 
 what God intended, no matter what 
 the doctors say; or that I’m gay is plain
 unnatural, she can’t endure such pain.
 The oven timer rings. The cookies that
 I’ve baked are done. I’ll make another batch
 though she won’t touch them: given up for Lent.
 My mother’s love. I wonder where it went.

title : Eagle Poem

author : Joy Harjo

text : 
To pray you open your whole self 
To sky, to earth, to sun, to moon 
To one whole voice that is you. 
And know there is more 
That you can’t see, can’t hear; 
Can’t know except in moments 
Steadily growing, and in languages 
That aren’t always sound but other 
Circles of motion. 
Like eagle that Sunday morning 
Over Salt River. Circled in blue sky 
In wind, swept our hearts clean 
With sacred wings. 
We see you, see ourselves and know 
That we must take the utmost care 
And kindness in all things. 
Breathe in, knowing we are made of 
All this, and breathe, knowing 
We are truly blessed because we 
Were born, and die soon within a 
True circle of motion, 
Like eagle rounding out the morning 
Inside us. 
We pray that it will be done 
In beauty. 
In beauty.

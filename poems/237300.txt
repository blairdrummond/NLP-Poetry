The carpet in the kindergarten room 
was alphabet blocks; all of us fidgeting 
on bright, primary letters. On the shelf 
sat that week's inflatable sound. The th 
was shaped like a tooth. We sang 
about brushing up and down, practiced 
exhaling while touching our tongues 
to our teeth. Next week, a puffy U 
like an upside-down umbrella; the rest 
of the alphabet deflated. Some days, 
we saw parents through the windows 
to the hallway sky. Look, a fat lady, 
a boy beside me giggled. Until then 
I'd only known my mother as beautiful.

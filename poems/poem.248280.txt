Sonnet

                                  (To F. W. Harvey)
Out of the smoke and dust of the little room 
 With tea-talk loud and laughter of happy boys, 
 I passed into the dusk. Suddenly the noise 
 Ceased with a shock, left me alone in the gloom, 
 To wonder at the miracle hanging high 
 Tangled in twigs, the silver crescent clear.
 Time passed from mind. Time died; and then we were 
 Once more at home together, you and I. 
  
 The elms with arms of love wrapped us in shade 
 Who watched the ecstatic west with one desire, 
 One soul uprapt; and still another fire 
 Consumed us, and our joy yet greater made: 
 That Bach should sing for us, mix us in one 
 The joy of firelight and the sunken sun.

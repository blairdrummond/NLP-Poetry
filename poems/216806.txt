title : Stationed

author : Albert Goldbarth

text : 
It's the other ones, who soon enough return   
to being happy after the funeral, that are nearest   
to their own deaths—in their gaiety   
and everyday distraction, they're so open   

and unguarded . . . anything could enter them;   
could claim them. It's the ones who weep   
incessantly that are saved for now, the ones   
who have taken a little of it   

into their systems: this is how   
inoculation works. And sorrow is difficult,   
a job: it requires time to complete.   
And the tears?—the salt   

of the folk saying,   
that gets sprinkled over the tail feathers   
and keeps a bird from flying;   
keeps it stationed in this world.

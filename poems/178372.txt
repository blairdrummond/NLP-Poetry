title : I Knocked My Head against the Wall

author : Anna Swir

text : 
As a child 
I put my finger in the fire   
to become 
a saint. 

As a teenager 
every day I would knock my head against the wall. 

As a young girl 
I went out through a window of a garret   
to the roof 
in order to jump. 

As a woman 
I had lice all over my body. 
They cracked when I was ironing my sweater. 

I waited sixty minutes   
to be executed. 
I was hungry for six years. 

Then I bore a child,   
they were carving me   
without putting me to sleep. 

Then a thunderbolt killed me 
three times and I had to rise from the dead three times   
without anyone’s help. 

Now I am resting 
after three resurrections.

text : 
I know the origin of rocks, settling 
out of water, hatching crystals 
from fire, put under pressure 
in various designs I gathered 
pretty, picnic after picnic. 

And I know about love, a little, 
igneous lust, the slow affections 
of the sedimentary, the pressure 
on earth out of sight to rise up 
into material, something solid 
you can hold, a whole mountain, 
for example, or a loose collection 
of pebbles you forgot you were keeping.

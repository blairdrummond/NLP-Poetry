title : The Envoy of Mr. Cogito

author : Zbigniew Herbert

text : 
Go where those others went to the dark boundary   
for the golden fleece of nothingness your last prize 

go upright among those who are on their knees 
among those with their backs turned and those toppled in the dust 

you were saved not in order to live 
you have little time you must give testimony 

be courageous when the mind deceives you be courageous   
in the final account only this is important 

and let your helpless Anger be like the sea 
whenever you hear the voice of the insulted and beaten 

let your sister Scorn not leave you 
for the informers executioners cowards—they will win 
they will go to your funeral and with relief will throw a lump of earth   
the woodborer will write your smoothed-over biography 

and do not forgive truly it is not in your power   
to forgive in the name of those betrayed at dawn 

beware however of unnecessary pride 
keep looking at your clown’s face in the mirror   
repeat: I was called—weren’t there better ones than I 

beware of dryness of heart love the morning spring   
the bird with an unknown name the winter oak 

light on a wall the splendour of the sky   
they don’t need your warm breath 
they are there to say: no one will console you 

be vigilant—when the light on the mountains gives the sign—arise and go   
as long as blood turns in the breast your dark star 

repeat old incantations of humanity fables and legends   
because this is how you will attain the good you will not attain   
repeat great words repeat them stubbornly 
like those crossing the desert who perished in the sand 

and they will reward you with what they have at hand   
with the whip of laughter with murder on a garbage heap 

go because only in this way will you be admitted to the company of cold skulls 
to the company of your ancestors: Gilgamesh Hector Roland 
the defenders of the kingdom without limit and the city of ashes 

Be faithful Go

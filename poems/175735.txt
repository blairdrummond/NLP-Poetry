title : Boy and Egg

author : Naomi Shihab Nye

text : 
Every few minutes, he wants 
to march the trail of flattened rye grass 
back to the house of muttering 
hens. He too could make 
a bed in hay. Yesterday the egg so fresh 
it felt hot in his hand and he pressed it 
to his ear while the other children 
laughed and ran with a ball, leaving him, 
so little yet, too forgetful in games, 
ready to cry if the ball brushed him, 
riveted to the secret of birds 
caught up inside his fist, 
not ready to give it over 
to the refrigerator 
or the rest of the day.

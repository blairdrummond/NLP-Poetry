title : Heart to Heart

author : Rita Dove

text : 
It's neither red 
nor sweet. 
It doesn't melt 
or turn over, 
break or harden, 
so it can't feel 
pain, 
yearning, 
regret. 

It doesn't have 
a tip to spin on, 
it isn't even 
shapely—
just a thick clutch 
of muscle, 
lopsided, 
mute. Still, 
I feel it inside 
its cage sounding 
a dull tattoo: 
I want, I want—
but I can't open it: 
there's no key. 
I can't wear it 
on my sleeve, 
or tell you from 
the bottom of it 
how I feel. Here, 
it's all yours, now—
but you'll have 
to take me, 
too.

Act I, Scene viii, Air Xa??a??Thomas, I Cannot,a??
Polly.          I like a ship in storms was tossed,
                        Yet afraid to put into land,
                   For seized in the port the vessela??s lost
                        Whose treasure is contraband.
                           The waves are laid,
                           My dutya??s paid;
                        O joy beyond expression!
                           Thus safe ashore
                           I ask no more;
                        My all is in my possession.

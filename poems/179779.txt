title : When the World as We Knew It Ended

author : Joy Harjo

text : 
We were dreaming on an occupied island at the farthest edge 
of a trembling nation when it went down. 

Two towers rose up from the east island of commerce and touched 
the sky. Men walked on the moon. Oil was sucked dry 
by two brothers. Then it went down. Swallowed 
by a fire dragon, by oil and fear. 
Eaten whole. 

It was coming. 

We had been watching since the eve of the missionaries in their 
long and solemn clothes, to see what would happen. 

We saw it 
from the kitchen window over the sink 
as we made coffee, cooked rice and 
potatoes, enough for an army. 

We saw it all, as we changed diapers and fed 
the babies. We saw it, 
through the branches 
of the knowledgeable tree 
through the snags of stars, through 
the sun and storms from our knees 
as we bathed and washed 
the floors. 

The conference of the birds warned us, as the flew over 
destroyers in the harbor, parked there since the first takeover. 
It was by their song and talk we knew when to rise 
when to look out the window 
to the commotion going on— 
the magnetic field thrown off by grief. 

We heard it. 
The racket in every corner of the world. As 
the hunger for war rose up in those who would steal to be president 
to be king or emperor, to own the trees, stones, and everything 
else that moved about the earth, inside the earth 
and above it. 

We knew it was coming, tasted the winds who gathered intelligence 
from each leaf and flower, from every mountain, sea 
and desert, from every prayer and song all over this tiny universe 
floating in the skies of infinite 
being. 

And then it was over, this world we had grown to love 
for its sweet grasses, for the many-colored horses 
and fishes, for the shimmering possibilities 
while dreaming. 

But then there were the seeds to plant and the babies 
who needed milk and comforting, and someone 
picked up a guitar or ukulele from the rubble 
and began to sing about the light flutter 
the kick beneath the skin of the earth 
we felt there, beneath us 

a warm animal 
a song being born between the legs of her; 
a poem.

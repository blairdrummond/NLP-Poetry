Sonnet

My letters! all dead paper, ... mute and white ! -- 
And yet they seem alive and quivering 
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string 
And let them drop down on my knee to-night. 
This said, ... he wished to have me in his sight 
Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring 
To come and touch my hand ... a simple thing, 
Yet I wept for it! -- this, ... the paper's light ... 
Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed 
As if God's future thundered on my past. 
This said, I am thine -- and so its ink has paled 
With lying at my heart that beat too fast. 
And this ... O Love, thy words have ill availed, 
If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!

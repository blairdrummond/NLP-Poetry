title : A Poem for the Old Man

author : John Wieners

text : 
God love you
    Dana my lover
 lost in the horde
 on this Friday night,
 500 men are moving up
 & down from the bath
 room to the bar.
 Remove this desire
 from the man I love.
 Who has opened
    the savagery 
 of the sea to me.
  
 See to it that 
 his wants are filled
 on California street
 Bestow on him lar-
 gesse that allows him
 peace in his loins.
  
 Leave him not
 to the moths.
 Make him out a lion
 so that all who see him
 hero worship his
 thick chest as I did
 moving my mouth
 over his back bringing
 our hearts to heights
 I never hike over
    anymore.
 Let blond hair burn
 on the back of his
 neck, let no ache
 screw his face
 up in pain, his soul
    is so hooked.
 Not heroin.
 Rather fix these
 hundred men as his
 lovers & lift him
 with the enormous bale
 of their desire.

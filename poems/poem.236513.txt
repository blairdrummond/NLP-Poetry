'Tis strange indeed to hear us plead 
   For selling and for buying 
When yesterday we said: "Away 
   With all good things but dying."      

The world's ago, and we're agog 
   To have our first brief inning; 
So let's away through surge and fog 
   However slight the winning. 

What deeds have sprung from plow and pick! 
   What bank-rolls from tomatoes! 
No dainty crop of rhetoric 
   Can match one of potatoes. 

Ye orators of point and pith, 
   Who force the world to heed you, 
What skeletons you'll journey with 
   Ere it is forced to feed you. 

A little gold won't mar our grace, 
   A little ease our glory. 
This world's a better biding place 
   When money clinks its story.

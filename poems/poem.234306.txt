"The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!"

Love, Romantic Love, Infatuation & Crushes



The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!
   Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,
Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,
   Bright eyes, accomplish'd shape, and lang'rous waist!
Faded the flower and all its budded charms,
   Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,
Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,
   Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise -
Vanish'd unseasonably at shut of eve,
   When the dusk holiday - or holinight
Of fragrant-curtain'd love begins to weave
   The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight,
But, as I've read love's missal through to-day,
He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.

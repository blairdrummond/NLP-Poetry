title : Ross: Yellow Star

author : George Szirtes

text : 
The eye is drawn to that single yellow star 
that no wise man will follow. 
The hunched men in caps, the grimacing woman 
her eyes screwed up, cheeks hollow. 

We look and look again until we burn a hole 
in the paper. We strive to learn 
from their resignation but it is beyond us. 
We let them burn.

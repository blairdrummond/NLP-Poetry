title : The Antagonism

to Helena Shire
The Makers did not make 
The muddy winter hardening to privation, 
Or cholera in the keep, or frost’s long ache 
      Afflicting every mortal nation 
From lord to villagers in their fading dyes 
            —Those who like oxen strained   
      On stony clearings of the ground   
               From church to sties. 

            They sought an utterance, 
Or sunshine soluble in institution, 
An orthodoxy justified, at once 
      The dream and dreamer warmed in fusion, 
As in the great Rose Window, pieced from duty, 
            Where through Christ’s crimson, sun   
      Shines on your clothes till they take on 
               Value and beauty. 

            But carved on a high beam 
Far in the vault from the official version 
Gape gnarled unChristian heads out of whom stream   
      Long stems of contrary assertion, 
Shaped leaf ridging their scalps in place of hair.   
            Their origins lost to sight, 
      As they are too, cast out from light. 
               They should despair. 

            What stays for its own sake, 
Occulted in the dark, may slip an ending, 
Recalcitrant, and strengthened by the ache 
      Of winter not for the transcending.   
Ice and snow pile the gables of the roof 
            Within whose shade they hold, 
      Intimate with its slaty cold, 
               To Christ aloof.

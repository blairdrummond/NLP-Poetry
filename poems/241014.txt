title : Abd el-Hadi Fights a Superpower

author : Taha Muhammad Ali

text : 
In his life
 he neither wrote nor read.
 In his life he
 didn’t cut down a single tree,
 didn’t slit the throat
 of a single calf.
 In his life he did not speak
 of the New York Times
 behind its back,
 didn’t raise 
 his voice to a soul
 except in his saying:
 “Come in, please,
 by God, you can’t refuse.”
  
                —
  
 Nevertheless—
 his case is hopeless,
 his situation
 desperate.
 His God-given rights are a grain of salt
 tossed into the sea.
  
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
 about his enemies
 my client knows not a thing.
And I can assure you,
 were he to encounter
 the entire crew
 of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
 he’d serve them eggs
 sunny-side up,
 and labneh
 fresh from the bag.

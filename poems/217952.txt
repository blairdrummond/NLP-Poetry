title : Magnificat

text : 
When he had suckled there, he began    
to grow: first, he was an infant in her arms,    
but soon, drinking and drinking at the sweet    
milk she could not keep from filling her,    
from pouring into his ravenous mouth,    
and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy    
feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was    
huge, towering above her, the landscape,    
his shadow stealing the color from the fields,      
even the flowers going gray. And they came    
like ants, one behind the next, to worship    
him—huge as he was, and hungry; it was    
his hunger they admired most of all.    
So they brought him slaughtered beasts:    
goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own    
kin whose hunger was a kind of shame      
to them, a shrinkage; even as his was      
beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.      
    
The day came when they had nothing left    
to offer him, having denuded themselves    
of all in order to enlarge him, in whose    
shadow they dreamed of light: and that      
is when the thought began to move, small    
at first, a whisper, then a buzz, and finally,    
it broke out into words, so loud they thought    
it must be prophecy: they would kill him,      
and all they had lost in his name would return,    
renewed and fresh with the dew of morning.    
Hope fed their rage, sharpened their weapons.    
    
And who is she, hooded figure, mourner now    
at the fate of what she fed? And the slow rain,      
which never ends, who is the father of that?      
And who are we who speak, as if the world    
were our diorama—its little figures moved    
by hidden gears, precious in miniature, tin soldiers,    
spears the size of pins, perfect replicas, history    
under glass, dusty, old fashioned, a curiosity    
that no one any longer wants to see,    
excited as they are by the new giant, who feeds    
on air, grows daily on radio waves, in cyberspace,      
who sows darkness like a desert storm,    
who blows like a wind through the Boardrooms, 
 who touches the hills, and they smoke.

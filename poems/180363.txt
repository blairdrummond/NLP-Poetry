When I brood on Germany in the night 
No hope for sleep. I know I'll lie 
Awake with my eyes wide open while 
Tears scald my cheeks. 

The years are a blur of past and future: 
A good twelve of them have passed since I last 
Laid eyes on my mother—which may be why 
I'm in such a frenzy to see her. 

And I am desperate with desire. 
I am under the old mutter's spell. 
She circles my mind like a ring of fire. 
I hope to god she is alive and well. 

She loves me to pieces, the old woman, 
And when in her letters her script breaks down, 
I know she's shaken to her depths, I know 
When the mother in her's shocked by her role. 

My mother never leaves my mental space 
Free of time past, the twelve long years, 
Twelve! —that vanished without a trace 
Since our last satisfying hug and kiss. 

Don't worry about Germany: it's the picture 
Of health. It will outlast us. All and all. 
I'll know its borders again by the flare 
Of its barbarous oaks and lime-trees' salute. 

I wouldn't waste a moment thinking on 
Germany were it not for my mother...; 
Fatherland-is-forever; but the old 
Woman, being mortal, may soon grow...cold. 

Since I left the country death has taken 
Many I loved. And now the unbreathing 
Impinge too much upon my sympathy. 
Numbering the dead does me in. 

And yet I feel compelled to count and each 
Body added to the tally has a say 
In how my mourning grows: hordes of corpses 
Crush my chest. What—relief—when they...give way. 

Praise the lord. And the lighter light of France 
That through this window breaks as my wife, well- 
Tempered, radiant as dawn, dispels 
My German burden with her lovely smile.

title : The Obligation to Be Happy

author : Linda Pastan

text : 
It is more onerous 
than the rites of beauty 
or housework, harder than love. 
But you expect it of me casually, 
the way you expect the sun 
to come up, not in spite of rain 
or clouds but because of them. 

And so I smile, as if my own fidelity 
to sadness were a hidden vice— 
that downward tug on my mouth, 
my old suspicion that health 
and love are brief irrelevancies, 
no more than laughter in the warm dark 
strangled at dawn. 

Happiness. I try to hoist it 
on my narrow shoulders again— 
a knapsack heavy with gold coins. 
I stumble around the house,   
bump into things. 
Only Midas himself 
would understand.

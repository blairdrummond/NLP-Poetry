You couples lying 
where moon-scythes and day-scythes reaped you, 
browning fruit falls and sleeps 
in tangled nests, the wild grass, 
falls from your apple tree that still grows here: 
cry for your dead hero, his weak sword, his flight, 
that you were slaughtered and your bed poured whiteness, 
the issue of murdered marriage dawns. 
The streets crack, a house falls open to the air, 
sun and rain lie on the bed. 
And the river still runs in a child’s hands 
under the factory’s black hulk, 
four stacks that used to bloom with smoke 
over shining leaves, beneath thunderheads. 
Then the storm 
shatters and beats and after 
in woods 
a scented smoke of light, 
a dripping quiet, and the small gold snake 
sparkles at the pond’s edge. 
But who is he? What were 
the goods he made, what became of his loved wife, 
his children, and where 
has he gone, fearsome, powerless? The silver 
path of air from the river’s bend to its rippling away 
beneath the low concrete bridge 
is still pure. No one comes, and the child 
who watched by it has vanished. 
Or sometimes he appears for a day, a night, 
in the walls and windows reflected on the water, 
in goldfinches’ flight, cricket song, the heron’s great 
rise from the bank. Last a carp leaps, 
voices and a lantern slide down the secret stream 
in black and gold peace, 
past the child’s husk, the family never born.

A dinner party, coffee, tea, 
Sandwich, or supper, all may be 
In their way pleasant. But to me 
Not one of these deserves the praise 
That welcomer of new-born days, 
A breakfast, merits; ever giving 
Cheerful notice we are living 
Another day refreshed by sleep, 
When its festival we keep. 
Now although I would not slight 
Those kindly words we use 'Good night', 
Yet parting words are words of sorrow, 
And may not vie with sweet 'Good Morrow', 
With which again our friends we greet, 
When in the breakfast-room we meet, 
At the social table round, 
Listening to the lively sound 
Of those notes which never tire, 
Of urn, or kettle on the fire. 
Sleepy Robert never hears 
Or urn, or kettle; he appears 
When all have finished, one by one 
Dropping off, and breakfast done. 
Yet has he too his own pleasure, 
His breakfast hour's his hour of leisure; 
And, left alone, he reads or muses, 
Or else in idle mood he uses 
To sit and watch the venturous fly, 
Where the sugar's piled high, 
Clambering o'er the lumps so white, 
Rocky cliffs of sweet delight.

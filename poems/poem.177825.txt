Common Measure

As Ann came in one summer's day, 
   She felt that she must creep,
So silent was the clear cool house, 
   It seemed a house of sleep.
And sure, when she pushed open the door, 
   Rapt in the stillness there,
Her mother sat, with stooping head, 
   Asleep upon a chair;
Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid 
   Loose-folded on her knee,
So that her small unconscious face 
   Looked half unreal to be:
So calmly lit with sleep's pale light 
   Each feature was; so fair
Her forehead--every trouble was 
   Smoothed out beneath her hair.
But though her mind in dream now moved, 
   Still seemed her gaze to rest--
From out beneath her fast-sealed lids, 
   Above her moving breast--
On Ann; as quite, quite still she stood; 
   Yet slumber lay so deep
Even her hands upon her lap 
   Seemed saturate with sleep.
And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread 
   Stole over her, and then,
On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod, 
   And tiptoed out again.

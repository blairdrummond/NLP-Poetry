title : Birthday Lights

Light bulbs on a birthday cake.
 What a difference that would make!
      Plug it in and make a wish,
      then relax and flip a switch!
 No more smoke
       or waxy mess
       to bother any birthday guests.
 But Grampa says, “it’s not the same!
       Where’s the magic?
        Where’s the flame?
 To get your wish without a doubt,
 You need to blow some candles out!”

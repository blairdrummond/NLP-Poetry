Rhymed Stanza

A younger continent awakes:
After Bellona, we'll have Eve!
A new landscape rises from the wave:
No foam is flung yet on the rocks
The first drop bubbling from a spring
Hasn't yet washed a single field.
A giant on the Eiffel Tower's crown --
With moonlight threading through his hair --
Rejects his heavenly offspring, to give birth
To people living upon earth.
The lighthouse the tempest licked all night
Is a basket of seaweed crinkled tongues
It's tangled, and the tide brings in the heads
Of  Eves pale and rumpled in their flight.
They're preparing the new continent up at Sacre-Coeur.
A young man showed off the model houses there
On a byre and our Savior's hands
By my bed on the hill where pilgrims flock all year.
Some fry eggs on a little camping stove
One's got nothing left but one shoulder and his chest
There's a Breton peasant woman.
And the young man still stays by me
In this dormitory room Our Lord is nude
He offers his wounded hands
The new continent will take work and thought
It's at Sacre-Coeur it will be wrought.

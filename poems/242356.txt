title : Book 2, Epigram 40: De libro suo.  ﻿

author : Thomas Bastard

text : 
One said my book was like unto a coat,
 Of diverse colours black and red and white. 
 I, bent to cross him, said he spoke by rote.
 For they in making rather are unlike. 
      A coat, one garment made of many fleeces:
      My book, one meaning cut into many pieces.

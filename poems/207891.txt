My dear, I wonder if before the end 
You ever thought about a children’s game— 
I’m sure you must have played it too—in which   
You ran along a narrow garden wall   
Pretending it to be a mountain ledge   
So steep a snowy darkness fell away   
On either side to deeps invisible; 
And when you felt your balance being lost 
You jumped because you feared to fall, and thought   
For only an instant: That was when I died. 

That was a life ago. And now you’ve gone, 
Who would no longer play the grown-ups’ game   
Where, balanced on the ledge above the dark,   
You go on running and you don’t look down,   
Nor ever jump because you fear to fall.

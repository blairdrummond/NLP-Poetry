title : Country of the Proud

author : Léonie Adams

text : 
A fall over rock, 
Metal answering to water,   
Is the seal of this spot; 
A land trodden by music   
And the tune forgot. 

Of a region savage, 
The territory that was broken, 
Silver gushed free; 
And earth holy, earth meek shall receive it   
In humility. 

This, not dwelt in, this haunted,   
The country of the proud, 
Is curdling to stone, 
And careless of the feet of the waters   
As they glance from it down.

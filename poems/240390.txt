title : The Dead Send Their Gardener

author : Leslie Adrienne Miller

text : 
He arrives in the courtyard with two cartons
 of juice, each of which he’ll tip and drain
 at one go in the heat, and a sack of food
 for the roses. He looms over his tools, 
 blond and dusty as a stalk of ripe wheat,
 surely someone’s prized lover. Centuries
 bask among his hybrid teas, and he shakes
 his capable handfuls of food into their beds
 until nothing but roses nose the blues between lake
 and garden, lake and sky, the lapse of lawn
 where a party could be if those who lived here once
 returned to pour the wine. She’d be the sort
 to tuck a bud behind her ear, and he to catch
 one in his teeth. But alas, we’re guests
 of the present, expectant and sultry; all
 graciousness is fled, and rain fills the spent
 blooms, tumbles their tops, weighted with ruffles
 and shocks of pink. The gardener too disappears
 with his breeches the color of mustard and cinched
 with a string, gone back into the pages of Hardy
 or Lawrence. Perhaps, he’ll appear again Tuesday next,
 but he won’t look any of us living in the eye.

title : The Way to the River

author : W. S. Merwin

text : 
The way to the river leads past the names of   
Ash the sleeves the wreaths of hinges   
Through the song of the bandage vendor 

I lay your name by my voice   
As I go 

The way to the river leads past the late 
Doors and the games of the children born looking backwards   
They play that they are broken glass 
The numbers wait in the halls and the clouds 
Call 
From windows 
They play that they are old they are putting the horizon   
Into baskets they are escaping they are 
Hiding 

I step over the sleepers the fires the calendars   
My voice turns to you 

I go past the juggler’s condemned building the hollow   
Windows gallery 
Of invisible presidents the same motion in them all   
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing   
Sort of poker with somebody’s 

Old snapshots game I don’t understand they lose   
The rivers one 
After the other I begin to know where I am   
I am home 

Be here the flies from the house of the mapmaker   
Walk on our letters I can tell 
And the days hang medals between us 
I have lit our room with a glove of yours be   
Here I turn 
To your name and the hour remembers 
Its one word 
Now 

Be here what can we 
Do for the dead the footsteps full of money   
I offer you what I have my 
Poverty 

To the city of wires I have brought home a handful 
Of water I walk slowly 
In front of me they are building the empty 
Ages I see them reflected not for long 
Be here I am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands   
Have no names 
I have passed it I know 

         Oh Necessity you with the face you with   
         All the faces 

This is written on the back of everything 

But we 
Will read it together

title : Your Invitation to a Modest Breakfast

text : 

 It’s too cold to smoke outside, but if you come over,
 I’ll keep my hands to myself, or won’t I.
 I would like to tell you about the wall eaten up
  
 by the climbing plant—it was so beautiful.
 Various things have been happening to me,
 all of them sexual. The man on the bus
  
 took off his pants so I could see him better.
 Another man said, “Ignore him darlin’.
 Just sit on my lap.” But I’m not one of those
  
 who’s hungriest in the morning,
 unlike the man at the bakery
 who eats egg after egg after egg.
  
 Listen. Come over: the cold has already eaten
 the summer. I need another pair of ears:
 from the kitchen I can’t tell if I’m hearing wind chimes
  
 or some gray woman with failing arms
 dropping a pan full of onions and potatoes.
                                     This morning I need four hands—
  
 two to wash the greens, one to lift a teakettle,
 one to pour the milk. This morning, one little mouth
 will not do. We could play a game
  
 where we crouch on the tiles, two yellow dogs
 drinking coffee from bowls. We could play a game
 where we let the breakfast burn.
  
 Outside there’s a world where every love scene
 begins with a man in a doorway;
 he walks over to the woman and says “Open your mouth.”

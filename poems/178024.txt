title : Lime

author : Yusef Komunyakaa

text : 
The victorious army marches into the city, 
& not far behind tarries a throng of women 
Who slept with the enemy on the edge 
Of battlements. The stunned morning 

Opens into a dust cloud of hooves 
& drums. Some new priests cradle 
Stone tablets, & others are poised 
With raised mallets in a forest of defeated 

Statuary. Of course, behind them 
Linger the turncoats & pious 
Merchants of lime. What’s Greek 
Is forged into Roman; what’s Roman 

Is hammered into a ceremony of birds 
Headed east. Whatever is marble 
Burns in the lime kilns because 
Someone dreams of a domed bathhouse.

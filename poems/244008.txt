Eight stars make
 A soft solfege
  
 Above this motel
 Where there are never
  
 Stars.
 I let a skinny man
  
 Put his long thick dick in me for you
 So we could break our hearts
  
 The way you want me to. Somewhere a white
 Wall stretches up behind the backs of a tribe
  
 Whose obscurity protects its secret from the common
 World and the connivances it ordains.
  
 What time is it. What season is it.
 I don’t know.
  
 The moon blows green
 Gas into my skull
  
 I want to hide what I dream
 In a big boot, and wear the boot
  
 And starve as I lean upon the boot of my destitution
 And drag
  
 The truth as a gimp would drag the weight of her body.
 That would give me a feeling of honesty.

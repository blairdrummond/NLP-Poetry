—orphic fragment—
Carnival morning they
  were Greeks in Brazil,
    Africans in Greek
disguise. Said of herself
                                   she
       was born in a house in
    heaven. He said he was
     born in the house next
 door... They were in hell.
   In Brazil they were
                               lovebait.
      To abide by hearing was
         what love was... To 
       love was to hear without
    looking. Sound was the
                                      beloved’s
     mummy cloth... All to say,
 said the exegete, love in
    hell was a voice, to be spoken
  to from behind, not be able
     to turn and look... It
   wasn’t Greece where they 
                                          were,
 nor was it Benin... Carnival
morning in made-up hell, bodies
    bathed in loquat light, would-be
 song’s all the more would-be
     title, “Sound and Cerement,”
                                                voice
      wound in bandages
   raveling
                lapse

                  .

    Up all night, slept well
past noon. Awoke restless
  having dreamt she awoke on
     Lone Coast, wondering
   afterwards what it came 
                                       to,
     glimpsed interstice,
                                  crevice,
       crack... Saw her
  dead mother and brother
pull up in a car, her brother
   at the wheel not having driven
     while alive, newly taught
                                          by
   death it appeared. A fancy car,
                                                bigger 
  than any her mother had had while
     alive, she too better off it
appeared... A wishful read, “it
    appeared” notwithstanding, the
  exegete impossibly benign. Dreamt
                                                      a dream
      of dream’s end, anxious, unannounced,
   Eronel’s nevermore namesake, Monk’s
         anagrammatic Lenore... That the
       dead return in luxury cars made 
                                                       us
        weep, pathetic its tin elegance,
                                                      pitiable,
          sweet read misread,
       would-be
     sweet

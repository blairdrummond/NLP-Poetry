title : Baseball’s Sad Lexicon

author : Franklin Pierce Adams

text : 
These are the saddest of possible words: 
      “Tinker to Evers to Chance.” 
Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds, 
      Tinker and Evers and Chance. 
Ruthlessly pricking our gonfalon bubble, 
      Making a Giant hit into a double— 
Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble: 
      “Tinker to Evers to Chance.”

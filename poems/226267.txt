text : 
The water closing   
over us and the   
going down is all.   
Gills are given.   
We convert in a   
town of broken hulls 
and green doubloons. 
O you dead pirates   
hear us! There is   
no salvage. All 
you know is the color 
of warm caramel. All 
is salt. See how 
our eyes have migrated 
to the uphill side?   
Now we are new round   
mouths and no spines   
letting the water cover. 
It happens over   
and over, me in   
your body and you   
in mine.

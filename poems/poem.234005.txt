Astrophil and Stella 72: Desire, though thou my old companion art 
Sir Philip Sidney

Relationships, Love, Desire



Desire, though thou my old companion art, 
And oft so clings to my pure Love that I 
One from the other scarcely can descry, 
While each doth blow the fire of my heart, 
Now from thy fellowship I needs must part; 
Venus is taught with Dian's wings to fly; 
I must no more in thy sweet passions lie; 
Virtue's gold now must head my Cupid's dart. 
Service and honor, wonder with delight, 
Fear to offend, will worthy to appear, 
Care shining in mine eyes, faith in my sprite: 
These things are let me by my only dear; 
But thou, Desire, because thou wouldst have all, 
Now banished art. But yet alas how shall?

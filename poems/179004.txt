title : Somebody Else’s Baby

author : Mary Jo Salter

text : 
From now on they always are, for years now 
they always have been, but from now on you know 
they are, they always will be, 

from now on when they cry and you say 
wryly to their mother, better you than me, 
you’d better mean it, you’d better 

hand over what you can’t have, and gracefully.

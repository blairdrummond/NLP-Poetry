Give All to Love

Give all to love; 
Obey thy heart; 
Friends, kindred, days, 
Estate, good-fame, 
Plans, credit and the Muse,-- 
Nothing refuse. 

'T is a brave master; 
Let it have scope: 
Follow it utterly, 
Hope beyond hope: 
High and more high 
It dives into noon, 
With wing unspent, 
Untold intent: 
But it is a god, 
Knows its own path 
And the outlets of the sky. 

It was never for the mean; 
It requireth courage stout. 
Souls above doubt, 
Valor unbending, 
It will reward,-- 
They shall return 
More than they were, 
And ever ascending. 

Leave all for love; 
Yet, hear me, yet, 
One word more thy heart behoved, 
One pulse more of firm endeavor,-- 
Keep thee to-day, 
To-morrow, forever, 
Free as an Arab 
Of thy beloved. 

Cling with life to the maid; 
But when the surprise, 
First vague shadow of surmise 
Flits across her bosom young, 
Of a joy apart from thee, 
Free be she, fancy-free; 
Nor thou detain her vesture's hem, 
Nor the palest rose she flung 
From her summer diadem. 

Though thou loved her as thyself, 
As a self of purer clay, 
Though her parting dims the day, 
Stealing grace from all alive; 
Heartily know, 
When half-gods go,   
The gods arrive.

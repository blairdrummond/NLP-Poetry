“Hi, guy,” said I to a robin   
perched on a pole in the middle   
of the garden. Pink and yellow   
firecracker zinnias, rough green   
leaves of broccoli, 
and deep red tomatoes on dying stems   
frame his still presence. 

“I’ve heard you’re not 
THE REAL ROBIN. Bird watchers have   
agreed,” I said.”THE REAL ROBIN   
lives in England. They claim 
your are misnamed and that we ought   
to call you ‘a red-breasted thrush’   
because you are 
indigenous.” 

He fluffed up. “Am I not 
Jis ko ko?” he cried, “that persistent   
warrior who carries warmth 
northward every spring?” 
He seemed so young, his red belly   
a bit light and his wings, still 
faded brown. He watched me 
untangling the hose to water squash. 

“Look who’s talking!” he chirruped.   
“Your people didn’t come 
from Europe or even India.   
The turtles say you’re a relative   
to red clay on this great island.” 
Drops of crystal water   
sparkled on the squash. 

“Indigenous!” he teased   
as he flew by.

What bright soft thing is this? 
    Sweet Mary, the fair eyes' expense? 
    A moist spark it is, 
    A wat'ry diamond; from whence 
The very term, I think, was found 
The water of a diamond. 

    O 'tis not a tear, 
 'Tis a star about to drop 
From thine eye its sphere; 
   The sun will stoop and take it up. 
Proud will his sister be to wear 
This thine eyes' jewel in her ear. 

    O 'tis a tear 
 Too true a tear; for no sad eyne, 
    How sad so e're, 
 Rain so true a teare as thine; 
Each drop leaving a place so dear, 
Weeps for itself, is its own tear. 

    Such a pearl as this is, 
   (Slipped from Aurora's dewy breast) 
The rose bud's sweet lip kisses; 
   And such the rose itself, when vexed 
With ungentle flames, does shed, 
Sweating in too warm a bed. 

    Such the maiden gem, 
   By the wanton spring put on, 
Peeps from her parent stem, 
   And blushes on the manly sun: 
This wat'ry blossom of thy eyne, 
Ripe, will make the richer wine. 

    Faire drop, why quak'st thou so? 
 'Cause thou straight must lay thy head 
    In the dust? o no; 
   The dust shall never be thy bed: 
A pillow for thee will I bring, 
Stuffed with down of angels' wing. 

    Thus carried up on high, 
 (For to Heaven thou must go) 
    Sweetly shalt thou lie 
 And in soft slumbers bathe thy woe; 
Till the singing orbs awake thee, 
And one of their bright chorus make thee. 

    There thy self shalt be 
 An eye, but not a weeping one, 
    Yet I doubt of thee, 
 Whether th'hadst rather there have shone 
An eye of Heaven; or still shine here, 
In th'Heaven of Mary's eye, a tear.

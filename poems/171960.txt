title : The Poet Orders His Tomb

author : Edgar Bowers

text : 
I summon up Panofskv from his bed   
    Among the famous dead 
To build a tomb which, since I am not read,   
Suffers the stone’s mortality instead; 

Which, by the common iconographies   
    Of simple visual ease, 
Usurps the place of the complexities 
Of sound survivors once preferred to noise: 

Monkeys fixed on one bough, an almost holy   
    Nightmarish sloth, a tree 
Of parrots in a pride of family, 
Immortal skunks, unaromatically; 

Some deaf bats in a cave, a porcupine   
    Quill-less, a superfine 
Flightless eagle, and, after them, a line   
Of geese, unnavigating by design; 

Dogs in the frozen haloes of their barks,   
    A hundred porous arks 
Aground and lost, where elephants like quarks   
Ape mother mules or imitation sharks— 

And each of them half-venerated by   
    A mob, impartially 
Scaled, finned, or feathered, all before a dry   
Unable mouth, symmetrically awry. 

But how shall I, in my brief space, describe   
    A tomb so vast, a tribe 
So desperately existent for a scribe 
Knowingly of the fashions’ diatribe, 

I who have sought time’s memory afoot,   
    Grateful for every root 
Of trees that fill the garden with their fruit,   
Their fragrance and their shade? Even as I do it, 

I see myself unnoticed on the stair 
    That, underneath a clear 
Welcome of bells, had promised me a fair   
Attentive hearing’s joy, sometime, somewhere.

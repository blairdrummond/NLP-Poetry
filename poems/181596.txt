title : And So the Skin . . .

author : Peter Cole

text : 
And so their pounded hearts 
were worn— 
                                       like a badge 
                  or talisman, 
that canceled   
almost all their blindness— 

creation's linkage depending 
                                    on a drive itself 
         derived from a kind of kindness 
or desperation, the sense that one's 
inadequate, 
                                    at any rate 

the space for time— 

water has it, flowing   
(even from a faucet . . .) 
and here the black swan glides across it— 

as the sunlight's suddenly on my back, 
and now the skin along it's warmer, 
Lord,   
                  which lets me walk by the river . . .

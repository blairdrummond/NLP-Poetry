The Artichoke 

She bore only the heart,   
Worked at the stem with her   
Fingers, pulling it to her,   
And into her, like a cord. 

She would sustain him,   
Would cover his heart.   
The hairy needles 
And the bigger leaves, 

These she licked into shape,   
Tipping each with its point.   
He is the mud-flower, 
The thorny hugger. 


The Asparagus 

She sent packs of great beasts to pass 
Over him, trailing belly-fur and dust,   
Bending their nostrils to his frail spear.   
This was to toughen him. For what?   
Stupidly, like a squirrel, standing up,   
Looking here and there, looking to all sides, 

He is cut down and taken away. 
She can smell him steaming, his crowns   
Already tender, his spine giving in. 
Now he is threatening to wither terribly,   
And slip from the water altogether, 
And billow through the kitchen like prayer. 


The Cauliflower 

Her words clot in his head. 
He presses himself to remember   
And feels the skin peel back, 
The skull bleach, crack, fall away. 

All that's left of him is the brain, 
Its tissue knotting up to shade him,   
The pain of its light pulsing 
How to move, how to move. 


Herbs 

Before fog leaves the scrub-oak 
Or the grasses of the downland, 
Take dragonwort under the black alder,   
Take cockspur grass and henbane,   
The belladonna, the deadly nightshade.   
Free them as you would a spider's web,   
Singing over them: Out, little wen, 
                            Out, little wen. 
Sing this into the mouth of the woman. 


Corn 

I am the corn quail.   
What I do is quick.   
You will know only   
The muffled clucking,   
The scurry, the first   
Shiver of feathers   
And I will be up,   
I will be in your 
Head with no way out,   
Wings beating at the   
Air behind your eyes. 


Celery 

The hope with   
water is that it 
will conceal nothing, 

that a clearness 
will follow upon it   
like the clearness   
after much rain, 

or the clearness   
where the air   
reaches to the river 
and touches it, 

where the rain   
falls from the trees   
into the river. 


Bell Pepper 

To find enough rooms for the gathering   
The walls go on alone not waiting   
For corners but thinking of sleeves 
And how the wind fills them and the snow   
Fills them and how cold it is without   
Fires when there are not enough rooms. 


Potatoes 

It had been growing in her like vegetables.   
She was going into the ground where it could   
Do better, where she could have potatoes. 

They would be small and easily mistaken   
For stones. It would fall to her to   
Sort them out, persuade them to stay 

Close to her, comforting her, letting her   
Wear them on her body, in her hair,   
Helping her hold always very still.

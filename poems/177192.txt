I 

honey people murder mercy U.S.A.   
the milkland turn to monsters teach   
to kill to violate pull down destroy   
the weakly freedom growing fruit   
from being born 

America 

tomorrow yesterday rip rape   
exacerbate despoil disfigure   
crazy running threat the   
deadly thrall 
appall belief dispel 
the wildlife burn the breast   
the onward tongue 
the outward hand 
deform the normal rainy   
riot sunshine shelter wreck 
of darkness derogate 
delimit blank 
explode deprive 
assassinate and batten up 
like bullets fatten up 
the raving greed 
reactivate a springtime 
terrorizing 

death by men by more 
than you or I can 

STOP 


       II 

They sleep who know a regulated place 
or pulse or tide or changing sky 
according to some universal   
stage direction obvious   
like shorewashed shells 

we share an afternoon of mourning   
in between no next predictable 
except for wild reversal hearse rehearsal   
bleach the blacklong lunging 
ritual of fright insanity and more 
deplorable abortion 
more and 
more

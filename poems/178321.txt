title : Hello

Some nights 
the rat with pointed teeth   
makes his long way back   
to the bowl of peaches. 
He stands on the dining room table   
sinking his tooth 
drinking the pulp 
of each fruity turned-up face   
knowing you will read 
this message and scream.   
It is his only text, 
to take and take in darkness,   
to be gone before you awaken   
and your giant feet 
start creaking the floor. 

Where is the mother of the rat?   
The father, the shredded nest,   
which breath were we taking   
when the rat was born, 
when he lifted his shivering snout   
to rafter and rivet and stone?   
I gave him the names of the devil,   
seared and screeching names,   
I would not enter those rooms   
without a stick to guide me, 
I leaned on the light, shuddering,   
and the moist earth under the house,   
the trailing tails of clouds, 
said he was in the closet, 
the drawer of candles, 
his nose was a wick. 

How would we live together 
with our sad shoes and hideouts, 
our lock on the door 
and his delicate fingered paws 
that could clutch and grip, 
his blank slate of fur 
and the pillow where we press our faces?   
The bed that was a boat is sinking.   
And the shores of morning loom up   
lined with little shadows, 
things we never wanted to be, or meet,   
and all the rats are waving hello.

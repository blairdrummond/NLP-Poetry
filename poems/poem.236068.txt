Sonnet

To catch the spirit in its wayward flight 
Through mazes manifold, what task supreme! 
For when to floods has grown the quiet stream, 
Much human skill must aid its rage to fight; 
And when wild winds invade the solemn night, 
Seems not man's vaunted power but a dream? 
And still more futile, ay, we e'en must deem 
This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright 
Its restless wanderings, - to lure it back 
To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh 
Attend the strife; till, effort merged in prayer, 
Oft uttered, clung to - when of strength the lack 
Seems direst - brings the answer to our cry: 
A gift from Him who lifts our ev'ry care.

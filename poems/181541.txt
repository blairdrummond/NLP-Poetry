text : 
Before devising, your chicken you do not have to count. 
As for the penny which is rescued it is the penny which is obtained. 
The girl and the spice has become entirely from the splendid sugar. 
The boy has consisted of the tail of the slug and the snail and the puppy. 
As for the place of the woman there is a house. 
One basket your egg everything does not have to be made. 
The idiot hurries being about you fear because the angel steps on. 
Your cake cannot do possessing and is eaten thing. 
There is no wastefulness, unless so is, we want. 
The safe which is better than regrettable. 
Living, you have lived, permit.

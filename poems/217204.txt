In the beginning, a word, move; 
then a plan and then the reasons, 
which I do not remember exactly. 
I remember clearly only the clothes 
we were given for the journey 
and the last, silent meal we ate. 
We left the place as lightly as we 
had come, so many years before. 

From a sunlit state of innocence 
where white sheets were hung 
to dry like clouds over paradise; 
from eucalyptus-scented earth, 
a red house with a yard swung 
between dreaming hills, pillaged 
by raccoons, framed with lilies 
like trumpets of the archangels, 

we moved: into history, a river 
slowed by many bends, a village 
of peacocks with a hundred eyes; 
a low house among fields, with 
an iron stove, a winter shrine; 
a fireplace blackened by time, 
the fragile bones of a sparrow 
frozen in the shape of its flight. 

When father played his trombone 
in the attic, schoolchildren tittered 
in the street. In the late afternoon, 
the cows assembled at the gate, 
witless, waiting for a farmer's son. 
Home, the children conjugated 
verbs, found variables and drew 
diagrams of the human heart. 

Evenings, the round kitchen table, 
lit by a low Dutch lamp, summoned 
poets, players, horsethieves, to glasses 
of jenever. An incense of gossip rose 
slowly, blackening the walls. Outside, 
horses pawed the darkness, breathing 
delicate feathers of ice. We courted 
the favors of spiders, mice and moles. 

Our words grew small and porous as 
fossiled bones, our gestures groaned 
with the cold. The will-less world of 
water, wood and stone taught us when 
to yield. When it came time to move 
along again, we were four strangers 
waving at each other, in slow motion, 
across a deafening expanse of ocean.

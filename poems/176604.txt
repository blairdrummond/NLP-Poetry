title : Waking from Sleep

author : Robert Bly

text : 
Inside the veins there are navies setting forth,   
Tiny explosions at the waterlines, 
And seagulls weaving in the wind of the salty blood. 

It is the morning. The country has slept the whole winter. 
Window seats were covered with fur skins, the yard was full 
Of stiff dogs, and hands that clumsily held heavy books. 

Now we wake, and rise from bed, and eat breakfast!   
Shouts rise from the harbor of the blood, 
Mist, and masts rising, the knock of wooden tackle in the sunlight. 

Now we sing, and do tiny dances on the kitchen floor.   
Our whole body is like a harbor at dawn;   
We know that our master has left us for the day.

title : Chicken Pig

author : Jennifer Michael Hecht

It’s like being lost 
in the forest, hungry, with a 
plump live chicken in your cradling 
arms: you want to savage the bird, 
but you also want the eggs. 

You go weak on your legs. 
What’s worse, what you need 
most is the companionship, 
but you’re too hungry to know that. 
That is something you only know after 
you’ve been lost a lot and always, 

eventually, alit upon 
your bird; consumed her 
before you’d realized what 
a friend she’d been, letting you 
sleep-in late on the forest floor 
though she herself awoke 
at the moment of dawn 

and thought of long-lost 
rooster voices quaking 
the golden straw. She 
looks over at you, sleeping, 
and what can I tell you, she loves 
you, but like a friend. 

Eventually, when lost 
in a forest with a friendly chicken 
you make a point of emerging 
from the woods together, 
triumphant; her, fat with bugs, 
you, lean with berries. 

Still, while you yet wander, 
you can not resist telling her 
your joke: 

Guy sees a pig with three legs, 
asks the farmer, What gives? 
Farmer says, That pig woke   
my family from a fire, got us all out. 
Says the guy, And lost the leg thereby? 
Nope, says the farmer, 
Still had all four when he took  
a bullet for me when I had  
my little struggle with the law. 
Guy nods, So that’s where  
he lost his paw? Farmer shakes 
it off, says, Nah, we fixed him up. 
A pause, guy says, So how’d he lose  
the leg? Farmer says, Well, hell, 
a pig like that  
you don’t eat all at once. 

Chicken squints. Doesn’t think 
it’s funny.

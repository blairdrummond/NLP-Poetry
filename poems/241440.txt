 an urban image from the eighties
 when we hung out at Chez Madam Arthur
 and at the back of the room
 women wrapped their arms around
 nights of ink and dawn

 calendar of murmurs
 vague caresses about the planet and its water
 we could have confused words
 but there were doors open
 confetti in the midst of darkness
 gentle ways
 to swoon in a corner with she who
 put her tongue in my mouth
  
  
       3
  
 focus on yes, on the woman’s
 eyelids
 caress not silence not word
 focus beyond. Hold me back

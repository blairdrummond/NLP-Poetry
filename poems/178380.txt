title : Lightness in Autumn

author : Robert Fitzgerald

text : 
The rake is like a wand or fan,   
With bamboo springing in a span   
To catch the leaves that I amass   
In bushels on the evening grass. 

I reckon how the wind behaves   
And rake them lightly into waves   
And rake the waves upon a pile,   
Then stop my raking for a while. 

The sun is down, the air is blue,   
And soon the fingers will be, too,   
But there are children to appease   
With ducking in those leafy seas. 

So loudly rummaging their bed 
On the dry billows of the dead, 
They are not warned at four and three   
Of natural mortality. 

Before their supper they require   
A dragon field of yellow fire 
To light and toast them in the gloom.   
So much for old earth’s ashen doom.

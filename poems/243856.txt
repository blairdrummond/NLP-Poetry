                       Straight rye whiskey, 100 proof
                        you need a better friend?
                        Yes.        Myself.
  
 The lights
 the lights
 the lonely        lovely      fucking       lights
 and the bridge on a rainy Tuesday night
 Blue/green double-stars      the line
 that is the drive and on the dark alive
 gleaming river
 Xmas trees of tugs scream and struggle
  
                                    Midnite
  
 Drops on the train window wobble  .  stream
                                          My trouble
                                                               is
 it is her fate to never learn to make
                                              anything grow
                                    be born or stay
 Harbor beginnings and that other gleam  .  The train
 is full of long/way/home and holding lovers whose
           flesh I would exchange for mine
           The rain, R.F.,
  
  
           sweeps the river as the bridges sweep
           Nemesis is thumping down the line
           But I have premises to keep
           & local stops before I sleep
           & local stops before I sleep
  
                                                           The cree-
                                                           ping train
                                                           joggles
                                                           rocks across
                                                           I hear
 the waves below lap against the piles, a pier
                                                from which ships go
                                                           to Mexico
  
 a sign which reads
  
 PACE O MIO DIO
  
           oil
                                               “The flowers died when you went away”
  
 Manhattan Bridge
 a bridge between
 we state, one life and the next, we state
 is better so
 is no
            backwater, flows
                                          between us is
 our span our bridge our
 naked eyes
 open her
 see
 bridging whatever impossibility. . . PACE!
  
 PACE O MIO DIO
  
            oil
  
                                                           “The flowers died. . .”
                                                           Of course the did
  
 Not that I was a green thing in the house
  
                                 I was once.
                                 No matter.
  
  
 The clatter of cars over the span, the track
                                   the spur
 the rusty dead/pan ends of space
             of grease
  
  
 We enter the tunnel.
  
 The dirty window gives me back my face

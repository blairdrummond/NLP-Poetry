title : American Smooth

author : Rita Dove

text : 
We were dancing—it must have 
 been a foxtrot or a waltz,
 something romantic but
 requiring restraint,
 rise and fall, precise
 execution as we moved 
 into the next song without
 stopping, two chests heaving
 above a seven-league
 stride—such perfect agony,
 one learns to smile through,
 ecstatic mimicry
 being the sine qua non
 of American Smooth.
 And because I was distracted
 by the effort of 
 keeping my frame
 (the leftward lean, head turned
 just enough to gaze out
 past your ear and always
 smiling, smiling),
 I didn’t notice
 how still you’d become until
 we had done it
 (for two measures?
 four?)—achieved flight,
 that swift and serene
 magnificence,
 before the earth
 remembered who we were
 and brought us down. ﻿

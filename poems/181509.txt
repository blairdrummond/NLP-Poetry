title : self-exam (my body is a cage)

text : 
Do this: take two fingers, place them on 
the spot behind your ear, either 

ear, the spot where your skull drops off 

into that valley of muscle 
& nerve—that is the muscle that holds up 

the skull, that turns the dumb bone 
this way & that, that nods your face up & 

down when you think you 
get it—press deeper, touch the little bundle of 

nerves buried there, buried in 
the gristle—the nerves that make you blink 

when the light bewilders you, that make your tongue 
slide in & out when you think you’re in 

love, when you think you need a drink, touch 
that spot as if you have an itch, close your eyes & 

listen, please, close 
your eyes—can you hear it? We think our souls live 

in boxes, we think someone sits behind our eyes,
lording in his little throne, steering the fork to 

the mouth, the mouth to the tit, we think 
hungry children live in our bellies & run out with their 

empty bowls as the food rains 
down, we sometimes think we are those 

hungry children, we think 
we can think anything & it won’t 

matter, we think we can think cut out her tongue, 
& then ask her to sing.

title : Cantico del Sole

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation 
                      Troubles my sleep, 
The thought of what America, 
The thought of what America, 
The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation 
                      Troubles my sleep. 
Nunc dimittis, now lettest thou thy servant, 
Now lettest thou thy servant 
                      Depart in peace. 
The thought of what America, 
The thought of what America, 
The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation . . . 
                      Oh well! 
                      It troubles my sleep.

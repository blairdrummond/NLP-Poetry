title : Full Fadom Fiue Thy Father Lies

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
Full fadom five thy Father lies,
      Of his bones are Corrall made:
Those are pearles that were his eies,
      Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a Sea-change
Into something rich, & strange:
Sea-Nimphs hourly ring his knell.
         ding-dong.
Harke now I heare them, ding-dong, bell.

I get into bed with it, and spring 
the scarab legs of its locks. Inside, 
the stacked, shy wealth of his print— 
he could not write in script, so the pages 
are sturdy with the beamwork of printedness, 
WENT TO LOOK AT A CAR, DAD 
IN A GOOD MOOD AT DINNER, WENT 
TO TRY OUT SOME NEW TENNIS RACQUETS, 
LUNCH WITH MOM, life of ease— 
except when he spun his father's DeSoto on the 
ice, and a young tree whirled up to the 
hood, throwing up her arms—until 
LOIS. PLAYED TENNIS, WITH LOIS, 
LUNCH WITH MOM AND LOIS, LOIS 
LIKED THE CAR, DRIVING WITH LOIS, 
LONG DRIVE WITH LOIS. And then, 
LOIS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! SHE IS SO 
GOOD, SO SWEET, SO GENEROUS, I HAVE 
NEVER, WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE 
TO DESERVE SUCH A GIRL? Between the dark 
legs of the capitals, moonlight, soft 
tines of the printed letter gentled 
apart, nectar drawn from serif, the 
self of the grown boy pouring 
out, the heart's charge, the fresh 
man kneeling in pine-needle weave, 
worshipping her. It was my father 
good, it was my father grateful, 
it was my father dead, who had left me 
these small structures of his young brain— 
he wanted me to know him, he wanted 
someone to know him.

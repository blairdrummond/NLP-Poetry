title : They Sit Together on the Porch

author : Wendell Berry

text : 
They sit together on the porch, the dark 
Almost fallen, the house behind them dark. 
Their supper done with, they have washed and dried 
The dishes–only two plates now, two glasses, 
Two knives, two forks, two spoons–small work for two. 
She sits with her hands folded in her lap, 
At rest. He smokes his pipe. They do not speak, 
And when they speak at last it is to say 
What each one knows the other knows. They have 
One mind between them, now, that finally 
For all its knowing will not exactly know 
Which one goes first through the dark doorway, bidding 
Goodnight, and which sits on a while alone.

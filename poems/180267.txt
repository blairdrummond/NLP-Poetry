title : Narrative Without People

author : Hilda Raz

text : 
The soaked books lip open in piles. 
The shelves stoop, slough paint. 
The doors, their locks sprung, hinge air 
open to weather, gulp rain. 
Something here enters the trees. 

If we believe in ghosts, white pearl 
shadows the batten and boards. Rust 
runs on the shelves. The sounds on air 
wail, a nail in the thumb. Stickers 
underfoot poke holes. 

In rafters, wings or the suggestion of wings 
rend air, whoosh of rubbish, burnt rubber 
hooks for skeleton elbows. Ash, 
dry sift through moist fingers 
in a room where everything's mold.

title : Pauline Is Falling

                                             from the cliff's edge, 
kicking her feet in panic and despair 
as the circle of light contracts and blackness 
takes the screen. And that 
is how we leave her, hanging—though we know 
she will be rescued, only to descend 
into fresh harm, the story flowing on, 
disaster and reprieve—systole, diastole—split 
rhythm of a heart that hungers 

only to go on. So why is this like my mother, 
caged in a railed bed, each breath, 
a fresh installment in a tortured tale 
of capture and release? Nine days 
she dangled, stubborn, 
over the abyss, the soft clay crumbling 
beneath her fingertips, until she dropped 
with a little bird cry of surprise 
into the swift river below. 

Here metaphor collapses, for there was no love 
to rescue her, no small boat 
waiting with a net to fish her out, 
although the water carried her, 
and it was April when we buried her 
among the weeping cherries and the waving 
flags and in the final fade, a heron 
breasted the far junipers 
to gain the tremulous air and swim away.

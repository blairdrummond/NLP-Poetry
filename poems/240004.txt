title : from Step

author : George Albon

text : 
iridescence as old
story, that brought
cold from deep

a chord moves into
an upper chamber
among rival unknowns

declension toward one
endâ€”the merest
light-sensitive dot





a perfect world
the strokes same light value
runny, evened

illuminations came
from the plant
the signal blinked

search for asylum
carried on in an
inner distortion

title : When Father Decided He Did Not Love Her Anymore

author : Lynn Emanuel

text : 
Tonight I will remember the model   
With the wide, sad mouth 
Who used to pose for father 
Because I love the dangers of memory,   
The boarded window and door,   
Rooms where one bare bulb   
Makes shadows swell up the wall.   
And yet I recall only vaguely   
The way her hem rustled on the floor   
Like sand against tin 
Laisse-moi tranquille, epicier,   
It said because I want it to 
Say something memorable.   
I want her back 
That brilliant, farfetched woman   
Who drank coffee in our garden   
And the days father fed me   
Absinthe through a sugar cube   
So I would be asleep by noon   
And wake to find Ramona posing   
Naked with a tambourine. 
Tonight the whole world is a garden   
In which the immortal whispers   
Something about art 
And its opportunities: 
Memory like a bolt of silk 
In a tailor’s arms 
Can be made into anything   
Especially misfortune, 
Especially the year Ramona spent 
In a wrath almost Biblical 
And so far from the world 
Not even the moon could find 
Her study in Paris 
Where the doors opened to the river.

title : Underneath (13)﻿

text : 
needed          explanation
  
 because of the mystic nature        of the theory
  
 and our reliance          on collective belief
  
 I could not visualize the end
  
 the tools that paved the way broke
  
 the body the foundation the exact copy of the real
  
 our surfaces were covered
  
 our surfaces are all covered
  
 actual hands appear but then there is writing
  
 in the cave       we were deeply impressed
  
 as in addicted to results
  
 oh and dedication training     the idea of loss of life
  
 in our work we call this emotion
  
 how a poem enters into the world
  
 there is nothing wrong with the instrument
  
 as here I would raise my voice but
  
 the human being and the world cannot be equated
  
 aside from the question of whether or not we are alone
  
 and other approaches to nothingness
  
 (the term “subject”)(the term “only”)
  
 also opinion and annihilation
  
 (the body’s minutest sensation of time)
  
 (the world, it is true, has not yet been destroyed)
  
 intensification      void
  
 we are amazed
  
 uselessness is the last form love takes
  
 so liquid till the forgone conclusion
  
 here we are, the forgone conclusion
  
 so many messages transmitted they will never acquire meaning
  
 do you remember          my love my archive
  
 touch me (here)
  
 give birth to       a single idea
  
 touch where it does not lead to war
  
 show me    exact spot
  
 climb the stairs
  
 lie on the bed
  
 have faith
  
 nerves wearing only moonlight lie down
  
 lie still patrol yr cage
  
 be a phenomenon
  
 at the bottom below the word
  
 intention, lick past it
  
 rip     years
  
 find the burning matter
  
 love allows it (I think)
  
 push past the freedom (smoke)
  
 push past     intelligence (smoke)
  
 whelm      sprawl
  
 (favorite city)   (god’s tiny voices)
  
 hand over mouth
  
 let light arrive
  
 let the past strike us and go
  
 drift        undo
  
 if it please the dawn
  
 lean down
  
 say      hurt      undo
  
 in your mouth be pleased
  
 where does it say
  
 where does it say
  
 this is the mother tongue
  
 there is in my mouth a ladder
  
 climb down
  
 presence of world
  
 impassable       gap
  
 pass
  
 I am beside myself
  
 you are inside me       as history
  
 We exist         Meet me

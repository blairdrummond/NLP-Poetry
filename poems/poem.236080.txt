She raised her head. With hot and glittering eye, 
'I know,' she said, 'that I am going to die. 
Come here, my daughter, while my mind is clear. 
Let me make plain to you your duty here; 
My duty once -- I never failed to try--   
But for some reason I am going to die.' 
She raised her head, and, while her eyes rolled wild, 
Poured these instructions on the gasping child: 

'Begin at once -- don't iron sitting down--   
Wash your potatoes when the fat is brown--   
Monday, unless it rains -- it always pays 
To get fall sewing done on the right days--   
A carpet-sweeper and a little broom--   
Save dishes -- wash the summer dining-room 
With soda -- keep the children out of doors--   
The starch is out -- beeswax on all the floors--   
If girls are treated like your friends they stay--   
They stay, and treat you like their friends -- the way 
To make home happy is to keep a jar --   
And save the prettiest pieces for the star 
In the middle -- blue's too dark -- all silk is best--   
And don't forget the corners -- when they're dressed 
Put them on ice -- and always wash the chest 
Three times a day, the windows every week--   
We need more flour -- the bedroom ceilings leak--   
It's better than onion -- keep the boys at home--   
Gardening is good -- a load, three loads of loam--   
They bloom in spring -- and smile, smile always, dear--   
Be brave, keep on -- I hope I've made it clear.' 

She died, as all her mothers died before. 
Her daughter died in turn, and made one more.

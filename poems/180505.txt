title : Depression

author : Henry Carlile

text : 
He is pushing a black Ford 
through an empty street - 
a car like his father's 
that beat the flat roads like wind 
in summer and brought him here. 

He never forgave his father. 
That was the year he left home. 
Then there was talk of weather 
and everyone was packing. 
Windmills were stopped 
all over Kansas. 

He is thinking of fathers, 
the ways they never forgive you, 
withholding love like lust. 
But they quit, they stop like pumps. 
There is no way to 
set them working again. 

He is thinking of mothers, 
how she could not know how he 
half followed girls down dark streets 
of his heart, how that loneliness 
is passed to sons, 
to the fathers of sons. 

He is pushing a black Ford. 
Its problem is such a heart 
you cannot give it enough care. 
Like a father it will quit. 
And there is no end to this.

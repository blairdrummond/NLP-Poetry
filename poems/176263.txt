title : North of Childhood

FOR B.
Somewhere ahead I see you 
watching something out your window, 
what I don’t know. You’re tall, 
not on your tiptoes, green, 
no longer yellow, 
no longer little, little one, 
but the changeless changing 
seasons are still with us. 
Summer’s back, 
so beautiful it always reeks of ending, 
and now its breeze is stirring 
in your room commanding the lawn, 
trying to wake you to say the day is wasting, 
but you’re north of childhood now and out of here,   
and I’ve gone south.

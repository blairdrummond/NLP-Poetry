You hear the roadhouse before you see it,   
Its four-beat country tunes 
Amplified like surf through the woods,   
Silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,   
Setting beards of moss dancing 
On dim, indeterminate trees 
That border two-lane blacktop. 
Docked tonight, you reveal the badge 
Of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin   
Where cap shades face, babyhood 
Pallor above the sun-blackened jaw   
Bulging uneasy with a concrete grin   
And some inevitable need to weep.   
Don’t you think we live and breathe   
In the meantime, in lockstep 
With dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?   
Even now, you await secrets worse   
Than the few known ways a seized sky   
Will come to survive your pity. 
But on another far field, celebrated   
For its arrivals and evictions, you learn   
To be beautiful, never leading 
A sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,   
Fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,   
In this uncut land, this straight-edged air.   
Whadya want to know that isn’t yet a mystery   
Somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat   
Lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?   
So it is that later you track high above   
Familiar tamarack and ash, beginning   
The next inaccuracy alone, and again,   
Remembering that everything east of you 
Has already happened, on the same cold ground, 
In a swarm of time, finally spiked home   
To your surprise, nails flung to the air. 
And us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks   
You hear from the roadhouse before you see it.

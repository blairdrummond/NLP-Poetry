Beyond the strings of water 
clinging to the windowpane, 

there were no cranes, just rain, 
a sky blurred by wet glass, 

a pond corrugated by raindrops, 
and, inside, the smell of naphthalene bars, 

a Victrola with a broken arm, 
a spotty daguerreotype, a dusty crinolineâ€” 

O mildewed, seersucker suits 
draped over vacant chairs.

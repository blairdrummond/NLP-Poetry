I 

You are clear 
O rose, cut in rock, 
hard as the descent of hail. 

I could scrape the colour   
from the petals 
like spilt dye from a rock. 

If I could break you   
I could break a tree. 

If I could stir 
I could break a tree-- 
I could break you. 


II 

O wind, rend open the heat,   
cut apart the heat,   
rend it to tatters. 

Fruit cannot drop   
through this thick air-- 
fruit cannot fall into heat 
that presses up and blunts 
the points of pears   
and rounds the grapes. 

Cut the heat-- 
plough through it, 
turning it on either side   
of your path.

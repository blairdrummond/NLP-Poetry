title : Hey, Ma, Something’s under My Bed

text : 
I hear it at night 
when I turn out the light. 
It’s that creature who’s under my bed. 
He won’t go away. 
He’s determined to stay. 
But I wish he would beat it, instead. 

I told him to go, 
but he shook his head no. 
He was worse than an unwelcome guest. 
I gave him a nudge, 
but he still wouldn’t budge. 
It was hard to get rid of the pest. 

So I fired one hundred 
round cannon balls plundered 
from pirate ships sailing the seas. 
But he caught them barehanded 
and quickly grandstanded 
by juggling them nice as you please. 

The creature was slick. 
He was clever and quick. 
This called for a drastic maneuver. 
So I lifted my spread 
and charged under the bed 
with the roar of my mother’s new Hoover. 

But he snorted his nose 
and sucked in the long hose, 
the canister, cord, and the plug, 
and vacuumed in dust   
till I thought he would bust 
then he blew it all over the rug. 

Now this made me sore, 
so I cried, “This is war!” 
and sent in a contingent of fleas, 
an army of ants 
dressed in camouflage pants 
followed closely by big killer bees. 
But he welcomed them in 
With a sly, crafty grin, 
And he ate them with crackers and cheese. 

I screamed, “That’s enough!” 
It was time to get tough. 
“You asked for it, Creature,” I said, 
as I picked up and threw, 
with an aim sure and true, 
my gym sneaker under the bed. 

With each whiff of the sneaker 
the creature grew weaker. 
He staggered out gasping for air. 
He coughed and he sneezed 
and collapsed with a wheeze 
and accused me of not playing fair. 

Then holding his nose 
with his twelve hairy toes, 
the creature curled into a ball, 
and rolled ’cross the floor 
smashing right through the door. 
I was rid of him once and for all. 

The very next night 
when I turned out the light 
and was ready to lay down my head, 
I heard my kid brother 
cry out to my mother, 
“Hey, Ma, something’s under my bed.”

title : Armistice

author : Sophie Jewett

text : 
The water sings along our keel,   
   The wind falls to a whispering breath; 
I look into your eyes and feel 
   No fear of life or death;   
So near is love, so far away   
The losing strife of yesterday. 

We watch the swallow skim and dip; 
   Some magic bids the world be still;   
Life stands with finger upon lip; 
   Love hath his gentle will; 
Though hearts have bled, and tears have burned, 
The river floweth unconcerned. 

We pray the fickle flag of truce 
   Still float deceitfully and fair; 
Our eyes must love its sweet abuse;   
   This hour we will not care, 
Though just beyond to-morrow's gate,   
Arrayed and strong, the battle wait.

The best words get said frequently—they are like fertile pips.   
Apples fall heavily to the ground and lie in the sun, their scent   
abandoning them as a philosophy which cannot be further perfected. Love 
releases playful sensations even from serious things providing a life 
to think about. Take R—the only thing 
R could credit herself with was having lived 
her life and so she not only kept an account of it 
but did so not in the privacy of a diary but in the form of letters 
—abundant, profligate, indiscrete—that I want to write   
to you so as to note something that I read 
this morning: “It’s not that this or that means something 
to me but this!—or that!—means something to me.” Musically 
R bequeaths herself to posterity as a scholar might 
bequeath his or her library blowing twisted veils of rain 
past the narrow and curving windows in the last hour that will carry us along 
to the time when those who come after us will learn 
what we know—a man with a mustache waxed and dyed   
green, a line of tall people and a woman at the door, a committee 
of children without scooters but not mournful, a poet with a motive, a pilot 
with a flashlight, a sulking but fascinated scholar, and Goethe no doubt 
for whom R would have released a flock of red canaries.

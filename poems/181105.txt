title : Sudek: Tree

author : George Szirtes

text : 
The visionary moment comes 
just as it is raining , just as bombs 
are falling,  just as atoms 

burst like a sneeze in a city park 
and enter the dark 
as if  it were the waiting ark. 

You open your hand and blow 
the dust. You pick and throw 
the stone. You make the round  O 

of  your mouth perfect as light 
and the tree bends and stands upright 
in the stolid night.

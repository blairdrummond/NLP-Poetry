title : Skywriting

author : Charles Tomlinson

text : 
Three jets are streaking west:
   Trails are beginning to fray already: 
The third, the last set out,
   Climbs parallel a March sky
Paying out a ruled white line:
   Skywriting like an incision,
Such surgical precision defines
   The mile between it and the others 
Who have disappeared leaving behind
   Only their now ghostly tracks 
That still hold to the height and map
   Their direction with a failing clarity: 
The sky is higher for their passing
   Where the third plane scans its breadth.
The mere bare blue would never have shown
   That vaultlike curvature overhead,
Already evading the mathematics of the spot,
   As it blooms back, a cool canopy,
A celestial meadow, needing no measure
   But a reconnaissant eye, an ear
Aware suddenly that as they passed
   No sound accompanied arrival or vanishing 
So high were their flight-paths on a sky
   That has gone on expunging them since, 
Leaving a clean page there for chance
   To spread wide its unravelling hieroglyphs.

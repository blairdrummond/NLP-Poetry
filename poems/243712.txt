title : If a Garden of Numbers

If a garden is the world counted
                                                            and found analogue in nature
 One does not become two by ever ending
                                                                            so the stairs must be uneven in number
 and not exceed
 thirteen without a pause
 of two paces’ width, which
                                                  for instance, the golden section
                             mitigates between abandon
 and an orchestra just behind those trees,
 gradations of green that take a stethoscope: we risk:
 Length over width
                                   to make the horizon run straight
 equals
             to make the pond an oval:
                                                             Width
                                                             over length minus the width
                               in which descending circles curl
 into animals exact as a remainder.
  
                               Which means excess. The meaning of the real
 always exceeds that of the ideal, said someone.
                                                                                       He was speaking of Vaux-le-Vicomte,
 but it’s equally true of parking, or hunting, or wishing you could take it back. He
  
                               who is Allen Weiss, actually said, “The meaning
 of a plastic or pictorial construct always surpasses the ideal meaning of that work.”
 Which is something else entirely. Said
 the axonometric
 divided by
 the anamorphic.
                                There is nothing that controls our thoughts
 more than what we think we see,
 which we label “we.”

What the Rattlesnake Said
Vachel Lindsay
1879-1931


Nature, Stars, Planets, Heavens, Animals

Rhymed Stanza, Persona

The Moon's a little prairie-dog.   
He shivers through the night.   
He sits upon his hill and cries   
For fear that I will bite. 

The Sun's a broncho.   He's afraid   
Like every other thing,   
And trembles morning, noon and night 
Lest I should spring and sting.

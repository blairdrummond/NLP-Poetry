title : The People of the Other Village

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
hate the people of this village   
and would nail our hats 
to our heads for refusing in their presence to remove them 
or staple our hands to our foreheads   
for refusing to salute them 
if we did not hurt them first: mail them packages of rats, 
mix their flour at night with broken glass. 
We do this, they do that. 
They peel the larynx from one of our brothers’ throats. 
We devein one of their sisters. 
The quicksand pits they built were good. 
Our amputation teams were better. 
We trained some birds to steal their wheat. 
They sent to us exploding ambassadors of peace. 
They do this, we do that. 
We canceled our sheep imports.   
They no longer bought our blankets.   
We mocked their greatest poet   
and when that had no effect   
we parodied the way they dance 
which did cause pain, so they, in turn, said our God 
was leprous, hairless. 
We do this, they do that. 
Ten thousand (10,000) years, ten thousand 
(10,000) brutal, beautiful years.

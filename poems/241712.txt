title : You've Ruined My Evening/You've Ruined My Life

text : 
i would be eight people and then the difficulties vanish
 only as one i contain the complications 
 in a warm house roofed with the rib-cage of an elephant
 i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels
 and the images are the same but the emphasis shifts
 the actors bow gently to me and i envy them
 their repeated parts, their constant presence in that world

i would be eight people each inhabiting the others’ dreams
 walking through corridors of glass framed pages
 telling each other the final lines of letters
 picking fruit in one dream and storing it in another
 only as one i contain the complications
 and the images are the same, their constant presence in that world
 the actors bow gently to me and envy my grey mornings
  
 i would be eight people with the rib-cage of an elephant
 picking fruit in a warm house above actors bowing
 re-running the reels of my presence in this world
 the difficulties vanish and the images are the same
 eight people, glass corridors, page lines repeated
 inhabiting grey mornings roofed with my complications
 only as one walking gently storing my dream

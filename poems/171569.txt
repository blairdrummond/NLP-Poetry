title : Self-Portrait

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
He wants to be 
a brutal old man, 
an aggressive old man, 
as dull, as brutal 
as the emptiness around him, 

He doesn’t want compromise,   
nor to be ever nice 
to anyone. Just mean, 
and final in his brutal, 
his total, rejection of it all. 

He tried the sweet,   
the gentle, the “oh, 
let’s hold hands together” 
and it was awful, 
dull, brutally inconsequential. 

Now he’ll stand on 
his own dwindling legs.   
His arms, his skin,   
shrink daily. And 
he loves, but hates equally.

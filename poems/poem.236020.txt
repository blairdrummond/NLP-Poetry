Children in Slavery

When children play the livelong day, 
   Like birds and butterflies; 
As free and gay, sport life away, 
   And know not care nor sighs: 
Then earth and air seem fresh and fair, 
   All peace below, above: 
Life's flowers are there, and everywhere 
   Is innocence and love. 

When children pray with fear all day, 
   A blight must be at hand: 
Then joys decay, and birds of prey 
   Are hovering o'er the land: 
When young hearts weep as they go to sleep, 
   Then all the world seems sad: 
The flesh must creep, and woes are deep 
   When children are not glad.

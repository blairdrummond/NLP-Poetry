The loop of rusty cable incises   
its shadow on the stucco wall.   
My father smiles shyly and takes   
one of my cigarettes, holding it 

awkwardly at first, as if it were 
a dart, while the yard slowly 
swings across the wide sill of daylight.   
Then it is a young man’s quick hand 

that rises to his lips, he leans against the wall,   
his white shirt open at the throat, 
where the skin is weathered, and he chats   
and daydreams, something he never does. 

Smoking his cigarette, he is even   
younger than I am, a brother who   
begins to guess, amazed, that what   
he will do will turn out to be this. 

He recalls the house he had 
when I was born, leaning against it   
now after work, the pale stucco 
of memory, 1947. 

Baby bottles stand near the sink inside.   
The new wire of the telephone, dozing   
in a coil, waits for the first call. 
The years are smoke.

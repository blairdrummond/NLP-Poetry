title : The New Year

author : Jason Shinder

text : 
I will dive to the bottom of the hotel pool and find my mother’s hairpin.
  
 With the mouth of a drowning woman on my lap,
 I will add her breath to mine. In the dark, I will lay the thin white sheet
  
 of the moonlight over the blue plums of my wife’s breasts.
  
 With the new planet I discovered just when I thought I was losing my sight,
 I will love another man because I will be a woman.
  
 Everything important will never as yet have happened. Let it happen.
  
 I will throw a lit match on the secrets my body
 has kept from me and stand in the fire. The people I have sawed in half
  
 will appear in my bedroom mirror, getting dressed.

Conchita debemos to speak totalmente in English 
cuando we go into Sears okay      Por qué 
Porque didn’t you hear lo que pasó      It say 
on the eleven o’clock news anoche que two robbers 
was caught in Sears and now this is the part 
I’m not completely segura que I got everything 
porque channel 2 tiene tú sabes that big fat guy 
that’s hard to understand porque his nose sit on his lip 
like a elefante pues the point es que the robbers the police say 
was two young men pretty big y one have a hairy face 
and the other is calvo that’s right he’s baldy and okay 
believe me qué barbaridad porque Hairy Face 
and Mister Baldy goes right into the underwear department 
takes all the money from the caja yeah uh-huh the cash register 
and mira Mister Baldy goes to this poor Italian woman that I 
guess would be like us sixty o sixty-five who is in the section   
of the back-support brassieres and he makes her put a big bra 
over her head para que she can’t see nothing and kneel 
like she’s talking to God to save her poor life 
and other things horrible pero the point como dije 
es que there was two of them and both was speaking Spanish 
y por eso is a good thing Conchita so the people at Sears 
don’t confuse us with Hairy and Baldy that we speak English only 
okay ready 
                Oh what a nice day to be aquí en Sears Miss Conception

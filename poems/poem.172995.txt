Sonnet

I lived with visions for my company, 
Instead of men and women, years ago, 
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know 
A sweeter music than they played to me. 
But soon their trailing purple was not free 
Of this world's dust, -- their lutes did silent grow, 
And I myself grew faint and blind below 
Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come ... to be, 
Beloved, what they seemed. Their shining fronts, 
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same, 
As river-water hallowed into fonts) 
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame 
My soul with satisfaction of all wants -- 
Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.

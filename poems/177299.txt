In Tunis we try to discuss divorce   
And dying but give up to lounge 

With rug merchants under a plum tree.   
From its corner the lamb’s severed head 

Watches the flies drink from its eyes   
And its fat disappear into the fire. 

The light rinses the edge of your sandal,   
The two wasps that ornament the blur 

Of screened window. My grandmother   
Would have loved a night like this. 

In the wind chimes I can hear her tea cart   
With its china rolling through Cook Street’s 

Stony yard one summer when I was always   
Thirsty, and she moved like a figure 

On a clock from my lawn chair to the cart,   
Or swabbed me with alcohol, or cut 

My hair with the straight razor.   
I was a week out of the hospital. 

Beneath my breasts an incision was crossed   
With stitches of surgical thread. 

The scalpel came so close it gave   
My heart a quick kiss. I nearly died. 

Years later I can still see the skin   
Flutter on the inside of my left breast 

And my heart limps like a great uncle   
Who, because he was a Jew and lame, 

Was dragged by cossacks across the steppes.   
He became a friend asking a favor 

Of a horse who ran so hard, so perfectly   
Hard, that the green grass rose to meet him.

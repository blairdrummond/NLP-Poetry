title : Photo of Melville; Back Room, Old Bookstore

author : Stephen Sandy

text : 
I passed him by at first. From the photograph
 Peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
 From a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed
 At anything, as if to have looked enough
 Then turned aside worked best for him—as if
 Night vision was the discipline that eased
 The weight of what he saw. A man’s gaze posed
 Too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.
 That face could be a focus for this back room,
 For pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
 Fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial
 Unstopped to let huge Melville out, to calm
 The sea of pages; Melville in older age:
 The grown man’s sleepy defiance of denial.

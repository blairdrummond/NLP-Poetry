title : Gas Station Rest Room

author : Alan R. Shapiro

text : 
The present tense   
is the body’s past tense   
here; hence   
the ghost sludge of hands   
on the now gray strip 
of towel hanging limp 
from the jammed dispenser; 
hence the mirror   
squinting through grime   
at grime, and the worn- 
to-a-sliver of soiled soap   
on the soiled sink. 
The streaked bowl, 
the sticky toilet seat, air 
claustral with stink— 
all residues and traces 
of the ancestral   
spirit of body free 
of spirit—hence, 
behind the station, 
at the back end of the store, 
hidden away 
and dimly lit 
this cramped and   
solitary carnival   
inversion—Paul 
becoming Saul   
becoming scents 
anonymous   
and animal; hence,   
over the insides   
of the lockless stall 
the cave-like 
scribblings and glyphs   
declaring unto all 
who come to it 
in time: “heaven   
is here at hand 
and dark, and hell   
is odorless; hell 
is bright and clean.”

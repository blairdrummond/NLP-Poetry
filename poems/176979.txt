text : 
When we first heard from blocks away 
the fog truck’s blustery roar, 
we dropped our toys, leapt from our meals,   
and scrambled out the door 

into an evening briefly fuzzy. 
We yearned to be transformed— 
translated past confining flesh 
to disembodied spirit. We swarmed 

in thick smoke, taking human form   
before we blurred again, 
turned vague and then invisible,   
in temporary heaven. 

Freed of bodies by the fog, 
we laughed, we sang, we shouted.   
We were our voices, nothing else.   
Voice was all we wanted. 

The white clouds tumbled down our streets   
pursued by spellbound children   
who chased the most distorting clouds, 
ecstatic in the poison.

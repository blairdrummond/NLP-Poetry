This House 

Which represents you, as my bones do, waits, 
all pores open, for the stun of snow. Which will come, 
as it always does, between breaths, between nights 
of no wind and days of the nulled sun. 
And has to be welcome. All instinct wants to anticipate 
faceless fields, a white road drawn 
through dependent firs, the soldered glare of lakes. 

Is it wanting you here to want the winter in? 
I breathe you back into your square house and begin 
to live here roundly. This year will be between, 
not in, four seasons. Do you hear already the wet 
rumble of thaw? Stones. Sky. Streams. Sun. 
Those might be swallows at the edge of sight 
returning to last year's nest in the crook of the porchlight. 


Complaint 

'Dear God,' they write, 'that was a selfish winter 
to lean so long, unfairly on the spring!' 
And now — this too much greed of seedy summer. 
Mouths of the flowers unstick themselves and sting 
the bees with irresistible dust. Iris 
allow undignified inspection. Plain waste 
weeds dress up in Queen Anne's lace. Our mist- 
blue sky clouds heavily with clematis. 

'Too much,' they cry, 'too much. Begin again.' 
The Lord, himself a casualty of weather 
falls to earth in large hot drops of rain. 
The dry loam rouses in his scent, and under 
him — moist, sweet, discriminate — the spring. 
Thunder. Lightning. He can do anything. 


Between 

The wet and weight of this half-born English winter 
is not the weather of those fragmentary half-true willows 
that break in the glass of the canal behind our rudder 
as water arrives in our wake — a travelling arrow 
of now, of now, of now. Leaves of the water 
furl back from our prow, and as the pinnate narrow 
seam of where we are drives through the mirror 
of where we have to be, alder and willow 
double crookedly, reverse, assume a power 
to bud out tentatively in gold and yellow, 
so it looks as if what should be end of summer — 
seeds, dead nettles, berries, naked boughs — 
is really the anxious clouding of first spring. 
...'Real' is what water is imagining. 


Stasis 

Before the leaves change, light transforms these lucid 
speaking trees. The heavy drench of August 
alters, things; its rich and sappy blood 
relaxes where a thirst ago, no rest 
released the roots' wet greed or stemmed their mad 
need to be more. September is the wisest 
time — neither the unbearable burning word 
nor the form of it, cooped in its cold ghost. 

How are they sombre — that unpicked apple, red, 
undisturbed by its fall; calm of those wasp-bored amethyst 
plums on the polished table? Body and head 
easy in amity, a beam between that must, 
unbalanced, quicken or kill, make new or dead 
whatever these voices are that hate the dust. 


The Circle 

It is imagination's white face remembers 
snow, its shape, a fluted shell on shoot 
or flower, its weight, the permanence of winter 
pitched against the sun's absolute root. 

All March is shambles, shards. Yet no amber 
chestnut, Indian, burnished by its tent 
cuts to a cleaner centre or keeps summer 
safer in its sleep. Ghost be content. 

You died in March when white air hurt the maples. 
Birches knelt under ice. Roads forgot 
their ways in aisles of frost. There were no petals. 

Face, white face, you are snow in the green hills. 
High stones complete your circle where trees start. 
Granite and ice are colours of the heart.

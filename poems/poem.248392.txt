Rhymed Stanza

La Belgique ne regrette rien
Not with her ruined silver spires,
 Not with her cities shamed and rent,
 Perish the imperishable fires 
 That shape the homestead from the tent. 
  
 Wherever men are staunch and free,
 There shall she keep her fearless state,
 And homeless, to great nations be 
 The home of all that makes them great.

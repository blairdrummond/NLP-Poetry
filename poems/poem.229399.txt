Rhymed Stanza, Elegy

To have known him, to have loved him
      After loneness long;
And then to be estranged in life,
      And neither in the wrong;
And now for death to set his seal--
      Ease me, a little ease, my song!
By wintry hills his hermit-mound
      The sheeted snow-drifts drape,
And houseless there the snow-bird flits
      Beneath the fir-trees' crape:
Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine
      That hid the shyest grape.

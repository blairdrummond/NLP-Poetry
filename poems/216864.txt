text : 
A man steps out of sunlight, 
sunlight that streams like grace, 

still gaping at blue sky 
staked across the emptiness of space, 

into a history where shadows 
assume a human face. 

A man slips into silence 
that began as a cry,

still trailing music 
although reduced to the sigh 

of an accordion 
as it folds into its case.

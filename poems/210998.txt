title : Their Bodies

To the students of anatomy  at Indiana University
That gaunt old man came first, his hair as white 
As your scoured tables. Maybe you’ll recollect him 
By the scars of steelmill burns on the backs of his hands, 
On the nape of his neck, on his arms and sinewy legs, 
And her by the enduring innocence 
Of her face, as open to all of you in death 
As it would have been in life: she would memorize 
Your names and ages and pastimes and hometowns 
If she could, but she can’t now, so remember her. 

They believed in doctors, listened to their advice, 
And followed it faithfully. You should treat them 
One last time as they would have treated you. 
They had been kind to others all their lives 
And believed in being useful. Remember somewhere 
Their son is trying hard to believe you’ll learn 
As much as possible from them, as he did, 
And will do your best to learn politely and truly. 

They gave away the gift of those useful bodies 
Against his wish. (They had their own ways 
Of doing everything, always.) If you’re not certain 
Which ones are theirs, be gentle to everybody.

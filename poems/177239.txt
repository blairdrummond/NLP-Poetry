title : To the Muse

It is all right. All they do 
Is go in by dividing 
One rib from another. I wouldn’t   
Lie to you. It hurts 
Like nothing I know. All they do   
Is burn their way in with a wire. 
It forks in and out a little like the tongue   
Of that frightened garter snake we caught   
At Cloverfield, you and me, Jenny   
So long ago. 

I would lie to you 
If I could. 
But the only way I can get you to come up   
Out of the suckhole, the south face 
Of the Powhatan pit, is to tell you   
What you know: 

You come up after dark, you poise alone   
With me on the shore.   
I lead you back to this world. 

Three lady doctors in Wheeling open 
Their offices at night. 
I don’t have to call them, they are always there.   
But they only have to put the knife once   
Under your breast. 
Then they hang their contraption. 
And you bear it. 

It’s awkward a while. Still, it lets you   
Walk about on tiptoe if you don’t   
Jiggle the needle. 
It might stab your heart, you see. 
The blade hangs in your lung and the tube   
Keeps it draining. 
That way they only have to stab you   
Once. Oh Jenny. 

I wish to God I had made this world, this scurvy   
And disastrous place. I 
Didn’t, I can’t bear it 
Either, I don’t blame you, sleeping down there   
Face down in the unbelievable silk of spring,   
Muse of black sand, 
Alone. 

I don’t blame you, I know 
The place where you lie. 
I admit everything. But look at me.   
How can I live without you? 
Come up to me, love, 
Out of the river, or I will 
Come down to you.

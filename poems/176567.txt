title : Saguaro

author : Brenda Hillman

text : 
Often visitors there, saddened   
by lack of trees, go out   
to a promontory. 

Then, backed by the banded   
sunset, the trail   
of the Conquistadores, 

the father puts on the camera,   
the leather albatross,   
and has the children 

imitate saguaros. One 
at a time they stand there smiling,   
fingers up like the tines of a fork 

while the stately saguaro   
goes on being entered 
by wrens, diseases, and sunlight. 

The mother sits on a rock,   
arms folded 
across her breasts. To her 

the cactus looks scared,   
its needles 
like hair in cartoons. 

With its arms in preacher   
or waltz position,   
it gives the impression 

of great effort 
in every direction,   
like the mother. 

Thousands of these gray-green   
cacti cross the valley:   
nature repeating itself, 

children repeating nature,   
father repeating children   
and mother watching. 

Later, the children think   
the cactus was moral, 
had something to teach them, 

some survival technique   
or just regular beauty. 
But what else could it do? 

The only protection   
against death 
was to love solitude.

title : I Was Always Leaving

author : Jean Nordhaus

text : 
I was always leaving, I was 
about to get up and go, I was 
on my way, not sure where. 
Somewhere else. Not here. 
Nothing here was good enough. 

It would be better there, where I 
was going. Not sure how or why. 
The dome I cowered under 
would be raised, and I would be released 
into my true life. I would meet there 

the ones I was destined to meet.   
They would make an opening for me 
among the flutes and boulders, 
and I would be taken up. That this 
might be a form of death 

did not occur to me. I only know 
that something held me back, 
a doubt, a debt, a face I could not 
leave behind. When the door 
fell open, I did not go through.

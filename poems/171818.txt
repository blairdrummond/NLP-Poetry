title : Corsons Inlet

author : A. R. Ammons

text : 
I went for a walk over the dunes again this morning 
to the sea, 
then turned right along 
   the surf 
                         rounded a naked headland 
                         and returned 

   along the inlet shore: 

it was muggy sunny, the wind from the sea steady and high,   
crisp in the running sand, 
       some breakthroughs of sun 
   but after a bit 

continuous overcast: 

the walk liberating, I was released from forms,   
from the perpendiculars, 
      straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds 
of thought 
into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends   
               of sight: 

                         I allow myself eddies of meaning:   
yield to a direction of significance 
running 
like a stream through the geography of my work:   
   you can find 
in my sayings 
                         swerves of action 
                         like the inlet’s cutting edge: 
               there are dunes of motion, 
organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance   
in the overall wandering of mirroring mind: 
but Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events 
I cannot draw, the ledger I cannot keep, the accounting 
beyond the account: 

in nature there are few sharp lines: there are areas of   
primrose 
       more or less dispersed; 
disorderly orders of bayberry; between the rows 
of dunes, 
irregular swamps of reeds, 
though not reeds alone, but grass, bayberry, yarrow, all ... 
predominantly reeds: 

I have reached no conclusions, have erected no boundaries,   
shutting out and shutting in, separating inside 
          from outside: I have 
          drawn no lines: 
          as 

manifold events of sand 
change the dune’s shape that will not be the same shape   
tomorrow, 

so I am willing to go along, to accept   
the becoming 
thought, to stake off no beginnings or ends, establish   
         no walls: 

by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek   
to undercreek: but there are no lines, though 
       change in that transition is clear 
       as any sharpness: but “sharpness” spread out,   
allowed to occur over a wider range 
than mental lines can keep: 

the moon was full last night: today, low tide was low:   
black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk 
of air 
and, earlier, of sun, 
waved in and out with the waterline, waterline inexact,   
caught always in the event of change:   
       a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals 
       and ate 
to vomiting: another gull, squawking possession, cracked a crab,   
picked out the entrails, swallowed the soft-shelled legs, a ruddy 
turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits: 

risk is full: every living thing in 
siege: the demand is life, to keep life: the small 
white blacklegged egret, how beautiful, quietly stalks and spears 
               the shallows, darts to shore 
                            to stab—what? I couldn’t 
       see against the black mudflats—a frightened 
       fiddler crab? 

               the news to my left over the dunes and 
reeds and bayberry clumps was 
               fall: thousands of tree swallows 
               gathering for flight: 
               an order held 
               in constant change: a congregation 
rich with entropy: nevertheless, separable, noticeable 
          as one event, 
                      not chaos: preparations for 
flight from winter, 
cheet, cheet, cheet, cheet, wings rifling the green clumps, 
beaks 
at the bayberries 
    a perception full of wind, flight, curve, 
    sound: 
    the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness: 
the “field” of action 
with moving, incalculable center: 

in the smaller view, order tight with shape: 
blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed: carapace of crab: 
snail shell: 
            pulsations of order 
            in the bellies of minnows: orders swallowed,   
broken down, transferred through membranes 
to strengthen larger orders: but in the large view, no 
lines or changeless shapes: the working in and out, together   
            and against, of millions of events: this, 
                         so that I make 
                         no form of 
                         formlessness: 

orders as summaries, as outcomes of actions override   
or in some way result, not predictably (seeing me gain   
the top of a dune, 
the swallows 
could take flight—some other fields of bayberry   
            could enter fall 
            berryless) and there is serenity: 

            no arranged terror: no forcing of image, plan, 
or thought: 
no propaganda, no humbling of reality to precept: 

terror pervades but is not arranged, all possibilities   
of escape open: no route shut, except in   
   the sudden loss of all routes: 

            I see narrow orders, limited tightness, but will   
not run to that easy victory: 
            still around the looser, wider forces work: 
            I will try 
       to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder, widening   
scope, but enjoying the freedom that 
Scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,   
that I have perceived nothing completely, 
that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.

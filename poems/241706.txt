title : [The giant takes us﻿]﻿

The giant takes us
 down. A man with no arms.
 Unbreakable.
  
 What made today
 is concordant,
 transforms
 the brief decisive phase we call fear.
  
 I look to that whited-over part and see a face.
 Then I look to the black and
 see the same face.
  
 There were tunnels…chambers
 beneath some of the sidewalks…page after page of places…
  
 The last thing you think of.
 Won’t be my fluffy blonde hair.
  
 We have his ear.
 He was the first boy I knew. The liberation.
 Which I remember
 from sand. The pail shape. The whole world’s washed out.
  
 These words: take refuge.
 What I mean by dream in this case is
 his last dream.
 And you see no land, you’re that far away.
  
 Someone coughs
 in my first life.
 Someone must have noticed
 how like you he is…
  
 First you can’t be heard
 Then you can’t hear
 Then you can’t dial
 Then you can’t turn it off
  
 You pose a question, I repeat it.
 And as always with speech, one is blind. 
  
 As a reflector, as of cloth or
 thick flecked glass, as slats—
 You asked though
  
 about the self.
 There were fireflies,
 and the corn cut to the nubs. The windows
 shook, we saw a flash of light…
  
 then the tiniest 
 feckles
 of rain
  
 after we waited
 all day.

					Pitiful brother--the dreadful nights I owed him! "I've got no real involvement in the business. I toyed with his weakness, so--it was my fault--we wound up back in exile and enslavement."  He saw me as a loser, a weird child; he added his own prods.  I answered my satanic doctor, jeering, and made it out the window. All down a landscape crossed by unheard-of music, I spun my dreams of a nighttime wealth to come.  After that more or less healthy pastime, I'd stretch out on a pallet. And almost every night, soon as I slept, my poor brother would rise--dry mouth and bulging eyes (the way he'd dreamt himself!)--and haul me into the room, howling his stupid dream.  Truly convinced, I'd vowed to take him back to his primal state--child of the sun--and so we wandered, fed on wine from the caves and gypsy bread, me bound to find the place itself and the code.

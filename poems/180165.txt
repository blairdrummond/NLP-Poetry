title : Not to Be Dwelled On

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
Self-interest cropped up even there,
the day I hoisted three instead of the 
two called-for
spades of loam onto 
the coffin of my friend.

Why shovel more than anybody else? 
What did I think I'd prove? More love
(mud in her eye)? More will to work
(her father what, a shirker?) Christ,
I'd give an arm or leg
to get that spoonful back.

She cannot die again; 
and I do nothing but relive.

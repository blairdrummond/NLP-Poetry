text : 
Sometimes she’s Confucian— 
resolute in privation. . . . 

Each day, more immobile, 
hip not mending, legs swollen; 

still she carries her grief   
with a hard steadiness. 

Twelve years uncompanioned,   
there’s no point longing for 

what can’t return. This morning,   
she tells me, she found a robin 

hunched in the damp dirt 
by the blossoming white azalea. 

Still there at noon— 
she went out in the yard 

with her 4-pronged metal cane— 
it appeared to be dying. 

Tonight, when she looked again,   
the bird had disappeared and 

in its place, under the bush,   
was a tiny egg— 

“Beautiful robin’s-egg blue”— 
she carried carefully indoors. 

“Are you keeping it warm?” 
I ask—what am I thinking?— 

And she: “Gail, I don’t want   
a bird, I want a blue egg.”

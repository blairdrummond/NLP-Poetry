title : Truly Pathetic

author : Neal Bowers

text : 
Lately, the weather aches;
 the air is short of breath,
 and morning stumbles in, stiff-jointed.

 Day by day, the sun bores the sky,
 until the moon begins
 its some disappearing act,
 making the oceans yawn.

 Even the seasons change
 with a throb of wearinessâ€”
 bud, bloom, leaf, fall.

 If it would help,
 I would paint my house silver
 or sell it or buy
 a red convertible.

 I would, but who am I
 to try to cheer up
 the self-indulgent universe.

title : Hypothetical Antipodes, Judgment

text : 
Hardly any of me is solid any more, I mean I buy 
things every day. 
And there comes a time when I am feeling 
as windblowed as the apples 
in the Shenandoah. 
And there goes I who then again began 
tho what does this Mrs. Begin? 
(she says I am) 

And cast down me wretched 
sinner unto thee I am 
slightly different from 
a corpse at a funeral 
in that I am less made up 
but made up worse. 

Who I thereby did appoint myself 
but forgot which was mirror. 
I stand stabbed with wrench piss 
rabid at the counter 
matter of things in the room 
with which I 
identify. 

Somewheres crossed up in hot 
antartic mountains 
they live backwards together. 

Whose feet then were backwards 
whose feet were needing shoes 
so badly in 1964 that millions 
virtual millions of shoes were 
sent to “Appalachia Virginia” 
for they were too poor—“backward.” 
America glared haughtily at 
local shoe burnings that Christmas. 

But I’m not antarctical 
nor hypo 
thetic. 

My mind gleams like the fangs 
of a viper in white heat 
dying to sink my teeth into 
the throat of something wrong.

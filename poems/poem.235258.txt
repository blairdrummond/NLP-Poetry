Metaphor

Any fool can get into an ocean   
But it takes a Goddess   
To get out of one. 
What's true of oceans is true, of course, 
Of labyrinths and poems. When you start swimming   
Through riptide of rhythms and the metaphor's seaweed 
You need to be a good swimmer or a born Goddess 
To get back out of them 
Look at the sea otters bobbing wildly 
Out in the middle of the poem 
They look so eager and peaceful playing out there where the 
    water hardly moves 
You might get out through all the waves and rocks 
Into the middle of the poem to touch them 
But when you've tried the blessed water long 
Enough to want to start backward 
That's when the fun starts 
Unless you're a poet or an otter or something supernatural 
You'll drown, dear. You'll drown 
Any Greek can get you into a labyrinth 
But it takes a hero to get out of one 
What's true of labyrinths is true of course 
Of love and memory. When you start remembering.

Blank Verse

THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare 
So Charming left his voice, that he a while 
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; 
Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd. 
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence 
Equal have I to render thee, Divine 
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd 
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't 
This friendly condescention to relate 
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard 
With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, 
With glorie attributed to the high 
Creator; something yet of doubt remaines, 
Which onely thy solution can resolve. 
When I behold this goodly Frame, this World 
Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute, 
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, 
An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd 
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle 
Spaces incomprehensible (for such 
Thir distance argues and thir swift return 
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light 
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, 
One day and night; in all thir vast survey 
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, 
How Nature wise and frugal could commit 
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand 
So many nobler Bodies to create, 
Greater so manifold to this one use, 
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose 
Such restless revolution day by day 
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, 
That better might with farr less compass move, 
Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines 
Her end without least motion, and receaves, 
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought 
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; 
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. 

So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd 
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve 
Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight, 
With lowliness Majestic from her seat, 
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, 
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, 
To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom, 
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung 
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. 
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse 
Delighted, or not capable her eare 
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd, 
Adam relating, she sole Auditress; 
Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd 
Before the Angel, and of him to ask 
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix 
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute 
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip 
Not Words alone pleas'd her.   O when meet now 
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? 
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; 
Not unattended, for on her as Queen 
A pomp of winning Graces waited still, 
And from about her shot Darts of desire 
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. 
And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd 
Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. 

To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n 
Is as the Book of God before thee set, 
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne 
His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: 
This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth, 
Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest 
From Man or Angel the great Architect 
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge 
His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought 
Rather admire; or if they list to try 
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns 
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move 
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide 
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n 
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild 
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive 
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear 
With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, 
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: 
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, 
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest 
That bodies bright and greater should not serve 
The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run, 
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves 
The benefit: consider first, that Great 
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth 
Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small, 
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe 
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines 
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, 
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd 
His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find. 
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries 
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. 
And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak 
The Makers high magnificence, who built 
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; 
That Man may know he dwells not in his own; 
An Edifice too large for him to fill, 
Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest 
Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. 
The swiftness of those Circles attribute 
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, 
That to corporeal substances could adde 
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, 
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n 
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd 
In Eden, distance inexpressible 
By Numbers that have name.   But this I urge, 
Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew 
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd; 
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem 
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. 
God to remove his wayes from human sense, 
Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, 
If it presume, might erre in things too high, 
And no advantage gaine.   What if the Sun 
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs 
By his attractive vertue and thir own 
Incited, dance about him various rounds? 
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, 
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, 
In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these 
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, 
Insensibly three different Motions move? 
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, 
Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, 
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift 
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, 
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele 
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, 
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day 
Travelling East, and with her part averse 
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part 
Still luminous by his ray.   What if that light 
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, 
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr 
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night 
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, 
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest 
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce 
Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate 
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps 
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie 
Communicating Male and Femal Light, 
Which two great Sexes animate the World, 
Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. 
For such vast room in Nature unpossest 
By living Soule, desert and desolate, 
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute 
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr 
Down to this habitable, which returnes 
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. 
But whether thus these things, or whether not, 
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n 
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun 
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, 
Or Shee from West her silent course advance 
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps 
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, 
And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along, 
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, 
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; 
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, 
Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou 
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise 
And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high 
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:. 
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; 
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there 
Live, in what state, condition or degree, 
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd 
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. 

To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. 
How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure 
Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, 
And freed from intricacies, taught to live, 
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts 
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which 
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, 
And not molest us, unless we our selves 
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain. 
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave 
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; 
Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, 
That not to know at large of things remote 
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know 
That which before us lies in daily life, 
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, 
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, 
And renders us in things that most concerne 
Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. 
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend 
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand 
Useful, whence haply mention may arise 
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask 
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. 
Thee I have heard relating what was don 
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate 
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; 
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest 
How suttly to detaine thee I devise, 
Inviting thee to hear while I relate, 
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: 
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, 
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare 
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst 
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre 
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, 
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine 
Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. 
To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. 

Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, 
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee 
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd 
Inward and outward both, his image faire: 
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace 
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes, 
Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth 
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire 
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: 
For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set 
On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on; 
For I that Day was absent, as befell, 
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, 
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; 
Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) 
To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, 
Or enemie, while God was in his work, 
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, 
Destruction with Creation might have mixt. 
Not that they durst without his leave attempt, 
But us he sends upon his high behests 
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure 
Our prompt obedience.   Fast we found, fast shut 
The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; 
But long ere our approaching heard within 
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, 
Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. 
Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light 
Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. 
But thy relation now; for I attend, 
Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. 

So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. 
For Man to tell how human Life began 
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? 
Desire with thee still longer to converse 
Induc'd me.   As new wak't from soundest sleep 
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid 
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun 
Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. 
Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, 
And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd 
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, 
As thitherward endevoring, and upright 
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw 
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, 
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, 
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, 
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, 
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. 
My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb 
Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran 
With supple joints, and lively vigour led: 
But who I was, or where, or from what cause, 
Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake 
My Tongue obey'd and readily could name 
What e're I saw.   Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, 
And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, 
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, 
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, 
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? 
Not of my self; by some great Maker then, 
In goodness and in power praeeminent; 
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, 
From whom I have that thus I move and live, 
And feel that I am happier then I know. 
While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, 
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld 
This happie Light, when answer none return'd, 
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours 
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep 
First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd 
My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought 
I then was passing to my former state 
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: 
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, 
Whose inward apparition gently mov'd 
My fancy to believe I yet had being, 
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, 
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, 
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd 
First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide 
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. 
So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, 
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire 
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up 
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, 
A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees 
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw 
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd.   Each Tree 
Load'n with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye 
Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite 
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found 
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream 
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun 
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide 
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd 
Presence Divine.   Rejoycing, but with aw 
In adoration at his feet I fell 
Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I am, 
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest 
Above, or round about thee or beneath. 
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine 
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: 
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes 
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: 
But of the Tree whose operation brings 
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set 
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith 
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life 
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, 
And shun the bitter consequence: for know, 
The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command 
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; 
From that day mortal, and this happie State 
Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World 
Of woe and sorrow.   Sternly he pronounc'd 
The rigid interdiction, which resounds 
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice 
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect 
Return'd and gracious purpose thus renew'd. 
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth 
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords 
Possess it, and all things that therein live, 
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. 
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold 
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave 
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie 
With low subjection; understand the same 
Of Fish within thir watry residence, 
Not hither summond, since they cannot change 
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. 
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold 
Approaching two and two, These cowring low 
With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. 
I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood 
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd 
My sudden apprehension: but in these 
I found not what me thought I wanted still; 
And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. 

O by what Name, for thou above all these, 
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, 
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I 
Adore thee, Author of this Universe, 
And all this good to man, for whose well being 
So amply, and with hands so liberal 
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee 
I see not who partakes.   In solitude 
What happiness, who can enjoy alone, 
Or all enjoying, what contentment find? 
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, 
As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. 
What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth 
With various living creatures, and the Aire 
Replenisht, and all these at thy command 
To come and play before thee, know'st thou not 
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, 
And reason not contemptibly; with these 
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. 
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd 
So ordering.   I with leave of speech implor'd, 
And humble deprecation thus repli'd. 

Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, 
My Maker, be propitious while I speak. 
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, 
And these inferiour farr beneath me set? 
Among unequals what societie 
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? 
Which must be mutual, in proportion due 
Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie 
The one intense, the other still remiss 
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove 
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak 
Such as I seek, fit to participate 
All rational delight, wherein the brute 
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce 
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; 
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; 
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle 
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; 
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. 
Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. 
 A nice and suttle happiness I see 
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice 
Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste 
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. 
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, 
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest 
Of happiness, or not? who am alone 
From all Eternitie, for none I know 
Second to me or like, equal much less. 
How have I then with whom to hold converse 
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those 
To me inferiour, infinite descents 
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? 
He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.   To attaine 
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes 
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; 
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee 
Is no deficience found; not so is Man, 
But in degree, the cause of his desire 
By conversation with his like to help, 
Or solace his defects.   No need that thou 
Shouldst propagat, already infinite; 
And through all numbers absolute, though One; 
But Man by number is to manifest 
His single imperfection, and beget 
Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, 
In unitie defective, which requires 
Collateral love, and deerest amitie. 
Thou in thy secresie although alone, 
Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not 
Social communication, yet so pleas'd, 
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt 
Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; 
I by conversing cannot these erect 
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. 
Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd 
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd 
This answer from the gratious voice Divine. 

Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, 
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, 
Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, 
Expressing well the spirit within thee free, 
My Image, not imparted to the Brute, 
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee 
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, 
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, 
Knew it not good for Man to be alone, 
And no such companie as then thou saw'st 
Intended thee, for trial onely brought, 
To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: 
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, 
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, 
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire. 

Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now 
My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, 
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth 
In that celestial Colloquie sublime, 
As with an object that excels the sense, 
Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair 
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd 
By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. 
Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell 
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which 
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, 
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape 
Still glorious before whom awake I stood; 
Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took 
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, 
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, 
But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and heal'd: 
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; 
Under his forming hands a Creature grew, 
Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly faire, 
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now 
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd 
And in her looks, which from that time infus'd 
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, 
And into all things from her Aire inspir'd 
The spirit of love and amorous delight. 
Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd 
To find her, or for ever to deplore 
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: 
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, 
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd 
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow 
To make her amiable: On she came, 
Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, 
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd 
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: 
Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, 
In every gesture dignitie and love. 
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. 

This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd 
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, 
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this 
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.   I now see 
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self 
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man 
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe 
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; 
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. 

She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, 
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, 
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, 
That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, 
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, 
The more desirable, or to say all, 
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, 
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; 
I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, 
And with obsequious Majestie approv'd 
My pleaded reason.   To the Nuptial Bowre 
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, 
And happie Constellations on that houre 
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth 
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; 
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires 
Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings 
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, 
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night 
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr 
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. 
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought 
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss 
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find 
In all things else delight indeed, but such 
As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, 
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies 
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and Flours, 
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here 
Farr otherwise, transported I behold, 
Transported touch; here passion first I felt, 
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else 
Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake 
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. 
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part 
Not proof enough such Object to sustain, 
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps 
More then enough; at least on her bestow'd 
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew 
Elaborate, of inward less exact. 
For well I understand in the prime end 
Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind 
And inward Faculties, which most excell, 
In outward also her resembling less 
His Image who made both, and less expressing 
The character of that Dominion giv'n 
O're other Creatures; yet when I approach 
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems 
And in her self compleat, so well to know 
Her own, that what she wills to do or say, 
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; 
All higher knowledge in her presence falls 
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her 
Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; 
Authority and Reason on her waite, 
As one intended first, not after made 
Occasionally; and to consummate all, 
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat 
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe 
About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. 
To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 

Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; 
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident 
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou 
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, 
By attributing overmuch to things 
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. 
For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, 
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well 
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, 
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; 
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more 
Then self esteem, grounded on just and right 
Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, 
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, 
And to realities yield all her shows: 
Made so adorn for thy delight the more, 
So awful, that with honour thou maist love 
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. 
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind 
Is propagated seem such dear delight 
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't 
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be 
To them made common and divulg'd, if aught 
Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue 
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. 
What higher in her societie thou findst 
Attractive, human, rational, love still; 
In loving thou dost well, in passion not, 
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines 
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat 
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale 
By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, 
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause 
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. 

To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. 
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught 
In procreation common to all kindes 
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far, 
And with mysterious reverence I deem) 
So much delights me as those graceful acts, 
Those thousand decencies that daily flow 
From all her words and actions mixt with Love 
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd 
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; 
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair 
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. 
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose 
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, 
Who meet with various objects, from the sense 
Variously representing; yet still free 
Approve the best, and follow what I approve. 
To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist 
Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; 
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; 
Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love 
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix 
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 

To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd 
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, 
Answer'd.   Let it suffice thee that thou know'st 
Us happie, and without Love no happiness. 
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st 
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy 
In eminence, and obstacle find none 
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: 
Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace, 
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure 
Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need 
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. 
But I can now no more; the parting Sun 
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles 
Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. 
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all 
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep 
His great command; take heed least Passion sway 
Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will 
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons 
The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. 
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, 
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall 
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. 
Perfet within, no outward aid require; 
And all temptation to transgress repel. 

So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus 
Follow'd with benediction.   Since to part, 
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, 
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. 
Gentle to me and affable hath been 
Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever 
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind 
Be good and friendly still, and oft return. 

So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n 
From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.

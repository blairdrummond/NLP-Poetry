Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,
I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon, 
I will make divine magnetic lands, 
                   With the love of comrades, 
                      With the life-long love of comrades. 

I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies, 
I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's necks, 
                   By the love of comrades, 
                      By the manly love of comrades. 

For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme! 
For you, for you I am trilling these songs.

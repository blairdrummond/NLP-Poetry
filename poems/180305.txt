You're dreaming 
of Cratoids, Armpullers, the Blownose Dragon. 
Who knows what Anna Brichtova dreamed about, the girl 
who comes looking for us tonight with her mosaic 
of colored paper: her house 
with its red roof, some trees on a green lawn, 
the sky—outside, the concentration camp. 
This is the real gift 
I brought back from Prague without telling you. 
It was with me on the train the morning 
I thought I was living in hell: Stuttgart, 
or south of there, amid a drone 
of people working—they don't know at what 
or for whom, but they're working, pressing keys, 
sending messages to unknown persons through the air. 
Nothing but eyes and fingers, nothing 
but one day after the next, interminable 
passage of a time that doesn't vary, that belongs 
forever to others, to something 
outside themselves, and the fear, the hatred 
of one pariah for another, this brawl 
of lost souls, of new slaves. The Great 
Drinker of Beer, the Woman Staring into Space, 
Mazinger Z: these were my traveling companions. 

Who knows what Anna Brichtova dreamed about, 
or what you're dreaming now, or how 
you children see the world. Will you find, 
among your games, the game that saves us? 
It's what we all are hoping 
as we watch you sleep.

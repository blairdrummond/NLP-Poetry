title : Hard Night

author : Christian Wiman

text : 
What words or harder gift 
does the light require of me 
carving from the dark 
this difficult tree?

What place or farther peace 
do I almost see 
emerging from the night 
and heart of me?

The sky whitens, goes on and on. 
Fields wrinkle into rows 
of cotton, go on and on. 
Night like a fling of crows 
disperses and is gone.

What song, what home, 
what calm or one clarity 
can I not quite come to, 
never quite see: 
this field, this sky, this tree.

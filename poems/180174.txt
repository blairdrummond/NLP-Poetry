text : 
What am I to think now, 
the white scut 
of her bottom 
disappearing 
down the half-flight 
carpet stair 
to the bathroom? 
What am I to do 
with this masted image? 
I put all my doubt 
to the mouth of her long body, 
let her draw the night 
out of me like a thorn. 
She touched it, and it moved: that's all.

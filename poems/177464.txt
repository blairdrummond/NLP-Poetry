Applying to Heavy Equipment School   
I marched farther into the Great Plains   
And refused to come out. 
I threw up a few scaffolds of disinterest.   
Around me in the fields, the hogs grunted   
And lay on their sides. 

You came with a little water and went away.   
The glass is still on the table, 
And the paper, 
And the burned scaffolds. 
   * 
You were bent over the sink, washing your stockings. 
I came up behind you like the night sky behind the town.   
You stood frowning at your knuckles 
And did not speak. 
   * 
At night I lie still, like Bolivia. 
My furnaces turn blue. 
My forests go dark. 
You are a low range of hills, a Paraguay.   
Now the clouds cover us both. 
It is raining and the movie houses are open.

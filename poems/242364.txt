title : Book 6, Epigram 14: De Piscatione.  ﻿

author : Thomas Bastard

text : 
Fishing, if I a fisher may protest,
 Of pleasures is the sweetest, of sports the best,
 Of exercises the most excellent. 
 Of recreations the most innocent. 
 But now the sport is marred, and what, ye, why?
 Fishes decrease, and fishers multiply.

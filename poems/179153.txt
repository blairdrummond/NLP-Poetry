title : A Song for Soweto

author : June Jordan

text : 
At the throat of Soweto 
a devil language falls 
slashing 
claw syllables to shred and leave   
raw 
the tongue of the young 
girl 
learning to sing 
her own name 

Where she would say   
                              water 
They would teach her to cry 
                                        blood 
Where she would save 
                              grass 
They would teach her to crave 
                                           crawling into the 
                                                    grave 
Where she would praise 
                                 father 
They would teach her to pray 
                                          somebody please 
                                          do not take him   
                                              away 
Where she would kiss with her mouth 
                                           my homeland 
They would teach her to swallow 
                                              this dust 
But words live in the spirit of her face and that 
sound will no longer yield to imperial erase 

Where they would draw   
                               blood 
She will drink 
                     water 
Where they would deepen 
                                  the grave 
She will conjure up 
                            grass 
Where they would take 
                               father and family away 
She will stand 
                     under the sun/she will stay 
Where they would teach her to swallow 
                                                       this dust 
She will kiss with her mouth 
                                          my homeland 
and stay 
with the song of Soweto 

stay 
with the song of Soweto

title : On Munsungun

author : Ethan Stebbins

text : 
My father in the aluminum stern, cursing   
another fouled blood-knot: all the shits   

and fucks as integral to the art of fishing   
as the bait-fish, little silver smelts   

I sewed like a manual transmission,   
the same inbred order and precision 

needling the leader through the ass, 
out the mouth, through the jaw, out the nostril   

and back down—suffering as my father suffered 
the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering Johnson 

the obligatory dud, orange egg-pearls   
ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of duds 

like every shit-luck setback that drove us on, 
fed by the huge image of everything   

we'd never caught, moving in joint blindness   
under Munsungun. 
                         And whatever it was   
it was the fight that delivered us—a tension 

like a sequestered muscle, the line 
spooling, unspooling, the holy-shit- 

litany pulled from our awed mouths 
contracting with distance until a whole   

silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body   
absorbing and reflecting raw light 

like the bit of cornea above a pupil. 
And then his tremendous, decent hands 

brandishing an oar-butt; the brilliant lace   
of the gills, their crumpled hinge flaring 

in bilge water; and the line, whipping 
and shuttling, feeding invisibly back, 

moving on on Munsungun, sons 
survived by the same damn hunt they heired.

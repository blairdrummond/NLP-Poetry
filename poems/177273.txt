title : The Fable

author : Yvor Winters

text : 
Beyond the steady rock the steady sea,
In movement more immovable than station, 
Gathers and washes and is gone. It comes, 
A slow obscure metonymy of motion, 
Crumbling the inner barriers of the brain. 
But the crossed rock braces the hills and makes 
A steady quiet of the steady music,
Massive with peace.
                              And listen, now:
The foam receding down the sand silvers 
Between the grains, thin, pure as virgin words, 
Lending a sheen to Nothing, whispering.

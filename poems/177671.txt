text : 
In the mud of a tire rut, 
         we were the filaments. 

We said if Mrs. Agnew could make music   
         on Spiro’s flute 

we said the clubs in the hands of the Chicago cops   
         would liquefy. 

The trees shook with the throb of steel. 

What did we do to be so red, white, and blue? 

We were inexorable 
         like the dialectic unraveling from Hanoi   
                  to the Jacksonian grass. 

We were the inebriates of vitamin C and cocaine,   
the daughters of the gray flannel suit. 

And when the shaman spread his yellow robe like the sun   
he was all teeth and amp 

and what were we?

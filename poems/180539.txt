title : Man of War

author : Carol Frost

text : 
After there were no women, men, and children, 

from the somber deeps horseshoe crabs crawled up on somber shores: 

Man-of-Wars' blue sails drifted downwind 

and blue filaments of some biblical cloak 

floated below: the stinging filaments. 

The cored of bone and rock-headed came near: 

clouds made wandering shadows: 

sea and grasses mingled:: 

There was no hell after all 

but a lull before it began over:: 

flesh lying alone: then mating: a little spray of soul: 

and the grace of waves, of stars, and remotest isles.

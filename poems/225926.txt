title : The Dome of Sunday

author : Karl Shapiro

text : 
With focus sharp as Flemish-painted face 
In film of varnish brightly fixed
And through a polished hand-lens deeply seen, 
Sunday at noon through hyaline thin air 
Sees down the street,
And in the camera of my eye depicts 
Row-houses and row-lives:
Glass after glass, door after door the same, 
Face after face the same, the same,
The brutal visibility the same;

As if one life emerging from one house 
Would pause, a single image caught between 
Two facing mirrors where vision multiplies
Beyond perspective,
A silent clatter in the high-speed eye 
Spinning out photo-circulars of sight.

I see slip to the curb the long machines
Out of whose warm and windowed rooms pirouette 
Shellacked with silk and light
The hard legs of our women.
Our women are one woman, dressed in black. 
The carmine printed mouth
And cheeks as soft as muslin-glass belong
Outright to one dark dressy man,
Merely a swagger at her curvy side.
This is their visit to themselves:
All day from porch to porch they weave
A nonsense pattern through the even glare, 
Stealing in surfaces
Cold vulgar glances at themselves.

And high up in the heated room all day
I wait behind the plate glass pane for one, 
Hot as a voyeur for a glimpse of one,
The vision to blot out this womanâ€™s sheen; 
All day my sight records expensively 
Row-houses and row-lives.

But nothing happens; no diagonal
With melting shadow falls across the curb:
Neither the blinded negress lurching through fatigue, 
Nor exiles bleeding from their pores,
Nor that bright bomb slipped lightly from its rack 
To splinter every silvered glass and crystal prism,
Witch-bowl and perfume bottle
And billion candle-power dressing-bulb, 
No direct hit to smash the shatter-proof 
And lodge at last the quivering needle
Clean in the eye of one who stands transfixed 
In fascination of her brightness.

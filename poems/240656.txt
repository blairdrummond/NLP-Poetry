                                       Ashur Square, Mosul
It begins simply with a fist, white-knuckled
 and tight, glossy with sweat. With two eyes
 in a rearview mirror watching for a convoy.
 The radio a soundtrack that adrenaline has
 pushed into silence, replacing it with a heartbeat,
 his thumb trembling over the button.

 A flight of gold, that’s what Sefwan thinks
 as he lights a Miami, draws in the smoke
 and waits in his taxi at the traffic circle.
 He thinks of summer 1974, lifting
 pitchforks of grain high in the air,
 the slow drift of it like the fall of Shatha’s hair,
 and although it was decades ago, he still loves her,
 remembers her standing at the canebrake
 where the buffalo cooled shoulder-deep in the water,
 pleased with the orange cups of flowers he brought her,
 and he regrets how so much can go wrong in a life,
 how easily the years slip by, light as grain, bright
 as the street’s concussion of metal, shrapnel
 traveling at the speed of sound to open him up
 in blood and shock, a man whose last thoughts
 are of love and wreckage, with no one there
 to whisper him gone.

 Sgt. Ledouix of the National Guard
 speaks but cannot hear the words coming out,
 and it’s just as well his eardrums ruptured
 because it lends the world a certain calm,
 though the traffic circle is filled with people
 running in panic, their legs a blur
 like horses in a carousel, turning
 and turning the way the tires spin
 on the Humvee flipped to its side,
 the gunner’s hatch he was thrown from
 a mystery to him now, a dark hole
 in metal the color of sand, and if he could,
 he would crawl back inside of it,
 and though his fingertips scratch at the asphalt
 he hasn’t the strength to move:
 shrapnel has torn into his ribcage
 and he will bleed to death in ten minutes,
 but he finds himself surrounded by a strange
 beauty, the shine of light on the broken,
 a woman’s hand touching his face, tenderly
 the way his wife might, amazed to find
 a wedding ring on his crushed hand,
 the bright gold sinking in flesh
 going to bone.

 Rasheed passes the bridal shop
 on a bicycle, with Sefa beside him,
 and just before the air ruckles and breaks
 he glimpses the sidewalk reflections
 in the storefront glass, men and women
 walking and talking, or not, an instant
 of clarity, just before each of them shatters
 under the detonation’s wave,
 as if even the idea of them were being
 destroyed, stripped of form,
 the blast tearing into the manikins
 who stood as though husband and wife
 a moment before, who cannot touch
 one another, who cannot kiss,
 who now lie together in glass and debris,
 holding one another in their half-armed embrace,
 calling this love, if this is all there will ever be.
  
                                             ~
  
 The civil affairs officer, Lt. Jackson, stares
 at his missing hands, which make
 no sense to him, no sense at all, to wave
 these absurd stumps held in the air
 where just a moment before he’d blown bubbles
 out the Humvee window, his left hand holding the bottle,
 his right hand dipping the plastic ring in soap,
 filling the air behind them with floating spheres
 like the oxygen trails of deep ocean divers,
 something for the children, something beautiful,
 translucent globes with their iridescent skins
 drifting on vehicle exhaust and the breeze
 that might lift one day over the Zagros mountains,
 that kind of hope, small globes which may have
 astonished someone on the sidewalk
 seven minutes before Lt. Jackson blacks out
 from blood loss and shock, with no one there to bandage
 the wounds that would carry him home.

 Nearby, an old woman cradles her grandson,
 whispering, rocking him on her knees
 as though singing him to sleep, her hands
 wet with their blood, her black dress
 soaked in it as her legs give out
 and she buckles with him to the ground.
 If you’d asked her forty years earlier
 if she could see herself an old woman
 begging by the roadside for money, here,
 with a bomb exploding at the market
 among all these people, she’d have said
 To have your heart broken one last time
 before dying, to kiss a child given sight
 of a life he could never live? It’s impossible,
 this isn’t the way we die.
  
                                             ~
  
 And the man who triggered the button,
 who may have invoked the Prophet’s name,
 or not—he is obliterated at the epicenter,
 he is everywhere, he is of all things,
 his touch is the air taken in, the blast
 and wave, the electricity of shock,
 his is the sound the heart makes quick
 in the panic’s rush, the surge of blood
 searching for light and color, that sound
 the martyr cries filled with the word
 his soul is made of, Inshallah.
  
                                             ~
  
 Still hanging in the air over Ashur Square,
 the telephone line snapped in two, crackling
 a strange incantation the dead hear
 as they wander confused amongst one another,
 learning each other’s names, trying to comfort
 the living in their grief, to console
 those who cannot accept such random pain,
 speaking habib softly, one to another there
 in the rubble and debris, habib
 over and over, that it might not be forgotten.

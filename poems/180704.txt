title : The Microcosm

author : Giovanni Battista Guarini

text : 
    Man of himself’s a little world, but join’d
With woman, woman for that end design’d,
(Hear cruel fair one whilst I this rehearse!)
He makes up then a complete universe.
    Man, like this sublunary world, is born
The sport of two cross planets, love, and scorn:
Woman the other world resembles well,
In whose looks Heav’n is, in whose breast Hell.

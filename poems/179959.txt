title : Christmas Away from Home

Her sickness brought me to Connecticut. 
Mornings I walk the dog: that part of life 
is intact. Who's painted, who's insulated 
or put siding on, who's burned the lawn 
with limeâ€”that's the news on Ardmore Street. 

The leaves of the neighbor's respectable 
rhododendrons curl under in the cold. 
He has backed the car 
through the white nimbus of its exhaust 
and disappeared for the day. 

In the hiatus between mayors 
the city has left leaves in the gutters, 
and passing cars lift them in maelstroms. 

We pass the house two doors down, the one 
with the wildest lights in the neighborhood, 
an establishment without irony. 
All summer their putto empties a water jar, 
their St. Francis feeds the birds. 
Now it's angels, festoons, waist-high 
candles, and swans pulling sleighs. 

Two hundred miles north I'd let the dog 
run among birches and the black shade of pines. 
I miss the hills, the woods and stony 
streams, where the swish of jacket sleeves 
against my sides seems loud, and a crow 
caws sleepily at dawn. 

By now the streams must run under a skin 
of ice, white air-bubbles passing erratically, 
like blood cells through a vein. Soon the mail, 
forwarded, will begin to reach me here.

After the Yoruba
Though the amaryllis sags and spills 
so do those my wishes serve, all along the town. 
And yes, the new moon, kinked there in night's patch, 
tugs me so—but I can't reach to right the slant. 
And though our cat pads past without a tail, some 
with slinking tails peer one-eyed at the dawn, some 
with eyes are clawless, some with sparking claws 
contain no voice with which to sing 
of foxes gassing in the lane. 
                                                         Round-shouldered pals 
parade smart shirts, while my broad back supports 
a scrubby jumper, fawn or taupe. 
                                                          The balding English 
air their stubble while some headless hero sports 
a feathered hat. I know a man whose thoroughbred 
grazes in his porch for want of livery. 
There are scholars of Kant who can't find Kent 
on the map, and men of Kent who cannot 
fathom Kant. 
                   We who would polish off a feast have lain 
late in our beds, our bellies groaning, throats on fire. 
We who'd drain a vat of wine have drunk 
our own blood for its sting. 
                                                            Each of us in tatters flaunts 
one treasured garment flapping in the wind.

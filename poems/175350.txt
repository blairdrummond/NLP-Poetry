title : Strangers

author : Annie Finch

text : 
She turned to gold and fell in love. 
She danced life upside down. 

She opened her wild eyes again 
and asked some strangers in. 

The strangers felt her in and out. 
They found her outsides thin. 

Since her heart was still and hard, 
they knocked her insides in.

Thy mercy, Lord, Lord, now thy mercy show:
                                          On thee I lie;
                                          To thee I fly.
                          Hide me, hive me, as thine own,
                          Till these blasts be overblown,
 Which now do fiercely blow.
  
 To highest God I will erect my cry,
                                          Who quickly shall
                                          Dispatch this all.
                          He shall down from heaven send
                          From disgrace me to defend
 His love and verity.
  
 My soul encaged lies with lions' brood,
                                          Villains whose hands
                                          Are fiery brands,
                          Teeth more sharp than shaft or spear,
                          Tongues far better edge do bear
 Than swords to shed my blood.
  
 As high as highest heav'n can give thee place,
                                           O Lord, ascend,
                                           And thence extend
                          With most bright, most glorious show
                          Over all the earth below,
 The sunbeams of thy face.
  
 Me to entangle every way I go
                                          Their trap and net
                                           Is ready set.
                          Holes they dig but their own holes
                          Pitfalls make for their own souls:
 So, Lord, oh, serve them so.
  
 My heart prepared, prepared is my heart
                                          To spread thy praise
                                          With tuned lays:
                          Wake my tongue, my lute awake,
                          Thou my harp the consort make,
 Myself will bear a part.
  
 Myself when first the morning shall appear,
                                          With voice and string
                                          So will thee sing:
                          That this earthly globe, and all
                          Treading on this earthly ball,
 My praising notes shall hear.
  
 For god, my only God, thy gracious love
                                          Is mounted far
                                          Above each star,
                          Thy unchanged verity
                          Heav'nly wings do lift as high
 As clouds have room to move.
  
 As high as highest heav'n can give thee place,
                                          O Lord, ascend
                                          And thence extend
                          With most bright, most glorious show
                          Over all the earth below,
 The sunbeams of thy face.

Moving from Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All, 
I take a box 
And add it to my wild rice, my Cornish game hens. 
The slacked or shorted, basketed, identical 
Food-gathering flocks 
Are selves I overlook. Wisdom, said William James, 

Is learning what to overlook. And I am wise 
If that is wisdom. 
Yet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves 
And the boy takes it to my station wagon, 
What I've become 
Troubles me even if I shut my eyes. 

When I was young and miserable and pretty 
And poor, I'd wish 
What all girls wish: to have a husband, 
A house and children. Now that I'm old, my wish 
Is womanish: 
That the boy putting groceries in my car 

See me. It bewilders me he doesn't see me. 
For so many years 
I was good enough to eat: the world looked at me 
And its mouth watered. How often they have undressed me, 
The eyes of strangers! 
And, holding their flesh within my flesh, their vile 

Imaginings within my imagining, 
I too have taken 
The chance of life. Now the boy pats my dog 
And we start home. Now I am good. 
The last mistaken, 
Ecstatic, accidental bliss, the blind 

Happiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm 
Some soap and water-- 
It was so long ago, back in some Gay 
Twenties, Nineties, I don't know . . . Today I miss 
My lovely daughter 
Away at school, my sons away at school, 

My husband away at work--I wish for them. 
The dog, the maid, 
And I go through the sure unvarying days 
At home in them. As I look at my life, 
I am afraid 
Only that it will change, as I am changing: 

I am afraid, this morning, of my face. 
It looks at me 
From the rear-view mirror, with the eyes I hate, 
The smile I hate. Its plain, lined look 
Of gray discovery 
Repeats to me: "You're old." That's all, I'm old. 

And yet I'm afraid, as I was at the funeral 
I went to yesterday. 
My friend's cold made-up face, granite among its flowers, 
Her undressed, operated-on, dressed body 
Were my face and body. 
As I think of her and I hear her telling me 

How young I seem; I am exceptional; 
I think of all I have. 
But really no one is exceptional, 
No one has anything, I'm anybody, 
I stand beside my grave 
Confused with my life, that is commonplace and solitary.

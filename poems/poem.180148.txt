An idle poet, here and there, 
    Looks round him; but, for all the rest, 
The world, unfathomably fair, 
    Is duller than a witling's jest. 
Love wakes men, once a lifetime each; 
    They lift their heavy lids, and look; 
And, lo, what one sweet page can teach, 
    They read with joy, then shut the book. 
And some give thanks, and some blaspheme 
    And most forget; but, either way, 
That and the Child's unheeded dream 
Is all the light of all their day.

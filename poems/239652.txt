title : from Spring Psalter

author : Nate Pritts

text : 
Darling, I leave you the forever unblooming
             twig half-sunk in spring mud & the Nature that allows
             such delicate & lasting atrocity.
  
 Darling, darling, darling: my voice is a branch that would reach.
  
 I leave you the ragged sky, once full of cloud & now
             not. I leave you these things just as I leave
  
 you: graceful passage from one something to the next.
             Darling, even in this my voice dissipates
  
 into hush & whiffs of light, sun-thrown, hurtle into the ground.

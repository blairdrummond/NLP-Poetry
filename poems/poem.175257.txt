Refrain, Ballad

We don't get any too much light; 
      It's pretty noisy, too, at that; 
The folks next door stay up all night; 
      There's but one closet in the flat; 
The rent we pay is far from low; 
      Our flat is small and in the rear; 
But we have looked around, and so 
      We think we'll stay another year. 

Our dining-room is pretty dark; 
      Our kitchen's hot and very small; 
The "view" we get of Central Park 
      We really do not get at all. 
The ceiling cracks and crumbles down 
      Upon me while I'm working here-- 
But, after combing all the town, 
      We think we'll stay another year. 

We are not "handy" to the sub; 
      Our hall-boy service is a joke; 
Our janitor's a foreign dub 
      Who never does a thing but smoke; 
Our landlord says he will not cut 
      A cent from rent already dear; 
And so we sought for better--but 
      We think we'll stay another year.

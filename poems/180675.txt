title : Meet Me in the Green Glen

author : John Clare

text : 
Love, meet me in the green glen,
   Beside the tall elm-tree,
Where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen;
   There come with me.
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me at the sunset
   Down in the green glen,
Where we’ve often met
   By hawthorn-tree and foxes’ den,
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me in the green glen,
   By sweetbriar bushes there;
Meet me by your own sen,
   Where the wild thyme blossoms fair.
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me by the sweetbriar,
   By the mole-hill swelling there;
When the west glows like a fire
   God’s crimson bed is there.
    Meet me in the green glen.

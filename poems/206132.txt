title : Fog Horns

author : David Mason

text : 
The loneliest days,    
damp and indistinct,    
sea and land a haze.    
    
And purple fog horns    
blossomed over tides—    
bruises being born    
    
in silence, so slow,    
so out there, around,    
above and below.    
    
In such hurts of sound    
the known world became    
neither flat nor round.    
    
The steaming tea pot    
was all we fathomed    
of   is  and   is not .    
    
The hours were hallways    
with doors at the ends    
opened into days    
    
fading into night    
and the scattering    
particles of light.    
    
Nothing was done then.    
Nothing was ever    
done. Then it was done.

title : from Odes: 36 ["See! Their verses are laid"]

author : Basil Bunting

text : 
See! Their verses are laid   
as mosaic gold to gold 
gold to lapis lazuli 
white marble to porphyry 
stone shouldering stone, the dice   
polished alike, there is 
no cement seen and no gap   
between stones as the frieze strides   
to the impending apse:   
the rays of many glories   
forced to its focus forming   
a glory neither of stone   
nor metal, neither of words   
nor verses, but of the light   
shining upon no substance;   
a glory not made 
for which all else was made.

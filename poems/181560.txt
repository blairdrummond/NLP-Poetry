title : Song of the Round Man

(for Sarah when she’s older)
The round and sad-eyed man puffed cigars as if 
he were alive. Gillyflowers 
to the left of the apple, purple bells to the right 

and a grass-covered hill behind. 
I am sad today said the sad-eyed man 
for I have locked my head in a Japanese box 

and lost the key. 
I am sad today he told me 
for there are gillyflowers by the apple 

and purple bells I cannot see. 
Will you look at them for me 
he asked, and tell me what you find? 

I cannot I replied 
for my eyes have grown sugary and dim 
from reading too long by candlelight. 

Tell me what you’ve read then 
said the round and sad-eyed man. 
I cannot I replied 

for my memory has grown tired and dim 
from looking at things that can’t be seen 
by any kind of light 

and I’ve locked my head in a Japanese box 
and thrown away the key. 
Then I am you and you are me 

said the sad-eyed man as if alive. 
I’ll write you in where I should be 
between the gillyflowers and the purple bells 

and the apple and the hill 
and we’ll puff cigars from noon till night 
as if we were alive.

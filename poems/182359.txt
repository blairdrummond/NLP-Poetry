title : Man in the Street or Hand Over Mouth

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
He claps a hand 
Across the gaping hole— 

Or else the sight might 
Well inside to 

Melt the mind—if any 
Thinking spoke 

Were in the wheel, 
Or any real 

Fright-fragments broke 
Out of the gorge to 

Soak the breast, the meaning 
Might incite a stroke—best 

Press against it, close 
The clawhole, stand 

In stupor, petrified. The dream 
Be damned, the deeps defied. 

The hand’s to keep 
The scream inside.

Far-sighted into yesterday 
they stand, gripping 
their charters and speeches, 
the presidents and kings, 
masters of unconscious evil. 

Their deputies are here — 
judges, robed executioners, 
steely and triumphant. 

And stunned at their feet, 
the beheaded, the betrayed, 
healed and hallowed now 
in this grave sorrow of wax. 


       II 

We enter, adjust to the gloom, 
to the lighting that plays 
on the painted, staring faces. 

We think to ourselves, murmur 
to the one standing beside us: 
"How compellingly strange 
these people are, and yet familiar 
to the world we left behind us, 
the street and the household..." 

These are the people whose names 
we learned, whose lives we studied, 
whose thoughts we have become. 

Each lighted stage with its play 
of the lost and the violent — 
comedians and stuntmen, 
heroes transfixed in purpose. 

We pause, to read once more, 
in deliberate, bald summation, 
what art, wax, and history 
have made of the dead: 

something more than a mirror, 
less than a telling likeness; 
an ideality slick with blood. 


       III 

How easily in the live heat 
of truth and summer 
these actors wilt and perish. 

Henry of Church and England 
is here, savage and senile, 
still laced in his armor; 
his lopped and stunted wives 
stand grouped around him. 

Bismark in his iron corset, 
endlessly dividing Europe; 
Wilhelm, that struttng dwarf, 
abject in abdication. 

And here, the fatal mischief 
of Sarajevo — how swift a fire, 
how long a burning, came 
of the Archduke's festive ride, 
his shot and bloodied tunic. 

And no more telling prophecy 
in the wake of armistice 
than that one dated cartoon 
with its hooded sentry 
and its graveyard owl: 
"It has been six years..." 

How easily a puff of smoke, 
a square of burnt cloth, 
a shocked cry, can change 
the world, and leave it 
neither worse nor better. 


       IV 

Here is a man, thief or martyr, 
hanged at Damascus Gate 
with a hook through his gut. 

He swung, seared by the sun 
and kissed by the night. 
And maybe one of the market 
women brought him water, 
and maybe not — once seen 
by the Sultan's watch, 
she might have lost her hands. 

As in the time of Richelieu, 
certain men the crown accused 
were exposed in iron baskets 
like plucked birds. 

They fouled their nests, 
starved and blackened until 
they died; and the city lived 
with their cries, their rank 
mortality, night and day. 

The hook is black and crescent, 
the body swings, inert, 
as if asleep and dreaming. 

The guidebook tells us the man 
survived his hook and lived; 
it doesn't say how long. 


       V 

Here, with his tins and furs, 
is Minuit, buying Manhattan. 
We see the Dutchman's flourish,   
the Indians' foolish feathers. 

He takes their land, and they 
his bitter gifts, his brass 
and trinkets — so little cash 
in place of an earthy kingdom. 

Wolfe, Montcalm, on the plain 
below Quebec: the one dying, 
the other condemned to follow. 

We pass, reading from face to face, 
from book to book, uneasy 
that among these celebrations 
so many rigged transactions 
have gone unquestioned. 

And all our wigged colonials, 
our Franklins, conspiring 
with their strongbox keys 
and profitable lightning — 

that so much ink and dust 
and shuffled paper conceals 
their tidy pilferings, 
their purity and blunted wrath. 

Were there rooms in this house, 
each with its tabled motions 
and false partitions 
might furnish a history, 
one slow truth at a time. 

But never in our late arrival 
have we stilled confusion, 
to learn how great a folly 
follows in the wake of fathers. 

From their deliberate violence 
we come to our own lamed 
misrule, its slick banality 
and crime without passion.   

To Ike, to Kennedy and Ford, 
golfers and temporizers; 
to perennial candidate Nixon, 
whose cheek was never turned. 

Out of his sleek arrest 
he steps towards us, 
as if to greet a voter — 

a fixed, ferocious smile 
on the blue jowls 
brushed with powder. 


       VI 

Nothing we have painted 
and framed in our passage — 
neither prayer nor courtship, 
nor solace of sleep 
and self — escaped the grip 
of these iron centuries. 

Here, in a row of lighted 
cases, a few artifacts 
are on display. No comfort 
to us now in that familiar, 
edged interrogation... 

But the biting persuasion 
of chains and collars, 
of inching racks, fire tongs 
and screws — in the eyes 
of kings and churchmen 
the instruments of truth. 

And whosoever might trespass, 
on whatever lawful ground, 
would find for his solace 
a more forbidding marriage. 

As once in a stone embrasure 
I saw a belt for virgins, 
a hinged and rusted clasp, 
with a lock, and a slit 
for functions — all but one. 

Imagine with what shocked 
dismay a man might grope 
for his sweetness there, 
and all too soon awaken, 
clamped in his ecstasy. 


       VII 

Another room, 
with smaller people 
and thinner walls. 

Here the Queen plays 
with cryptic cards, 
hands out assignments: 

"You are the Hunchback," 
she says, "and You 
the Hangman, and You 
the Jack of Trades." 

She pares and quarters 
her venomous apple, 
calls for her mirror, 
and her image smiles 
to watch her glass 
fill up with poison. 

Beauty is sleeping, 
the Prince is awake, 
and far in the forest 
a frostlight winks 
from the Sugar House. 

The Witch is singing 
and lighting her oven. 
The Woodcutter's 
wayward children watch, 
they break and nibble 
the sweetened glass. 

The images whisper 
and darken, conspiring 
in their tumbled tale 
of fretful spinners, 
of drones and dumble- 
dores, wise eggs 
that speak and shatter. 

And it looks as if 
the painted sleepers 
in this dreamworks 
are about to awaken: 

the crafty Queen 
and her players, 
the musical mice, 
the drones 
and the spinners — 

All in a scampering 
rush, to find 
the nearest exit... 

As the looking glass 
draws us deeper 
into the bright play 
of shadows that melt 
and run and freeze... 

The mad, mad romp 
of children, of rabbits 
and dwarfs, who keep 
their strange hilarity 
in so much horror. 


       VIII 

Call those from underneath, 
the sold and trodden, 
their slow and sweating sons, 
elevate and crown them. 

Patch up their clothing 
and wash their skins, 
rub their faces 
until they glow, 
and their dull eyes brighten. 

Give them speeches to learn, 
and eloquent gestures, 
power to grasp, 
laws to break and mend. 

Great heat and furious labor 
bring on in them 
this drear and mystical change: 

At first a swinish fattening, 
and then a leaner look, 
and in their eyes 
the same feral glitter 
of their late unkindly masters. 

They sicken as they flourish, 

until like wickless candles 
they slump and totter; 
their heads are rotten, 
their famous flesh 
has run to sticky pools. 

They die and sleep afoot, 
their ignorant hearts 
grown wise in the ways of wax. 


       IX 

In all these wax memorials 
only appearance changes. 

Crowned heads and axes fall, 
thugs and jailors rise 
and displace each other 
in this long, uneasy walk 
we have littered 
with claims and captions. 

The heroes are always welcomed, 
are propped and shaven, 
their ruddy male composure 
is sleeker than ever, 
though the great sleeves 
and brutal collars 
give way to softer buttons. 

The paper in official hands 
rustles as before, 
though it is only paper, 
paper in cheap supply, 
and not the bleached fell 
of a difficult sheep. 

And yet the neat persuasions   
are seen to tighten, 
and each new litigation 
is a running noose... 

All that increases, 
all that gluts and fattens, 
matures its option here: 
Honor to thieves and merchants, 
long life to the butcher. 

And for the just petitioner — 
sweeper of the hallways, scapegoat 
and discard — no reply 
but the rote of legal fictions; 

to which he listens, now 
as in the days of Pontinus, 
stricken with understanding. 


       X 

The rooms are large and numerous, 
and we in our restless striding 
find that they never end. 

It is as if we had lived here 
always, captive to this endless 
and malign instruction; 
had served those mighty tempers, 
and learned too well 
these never-blotted names. 

And we live here still, 
sharing these murderous spaces, 
this blood-haunted silence. 

And once we started from sleep, 
terrorized and whimpering, 
to see in the luminous, 
sunken light, the head 
of a long-forgotten agent: 

a face like a father, 
one who might have comforted, 
but cannot see or hear us: 
bald, vacant, and amused. 


       XI 

All is as it must or might be, 
here at the story's end — 
the jury dismissed, the witness 
excused, and all are guilty. 

To have come so far, walked 
so easily through so much anguish, 
pride, and stupor of evil, 
and yet we are standing still, 
locked in an echoing foyer. 

In so driven, so brief an itinerary, 
a day will stand for a decade, 
an inch for a mile — so far 
has a painted fiction served us. 

These bones in their period costumes 
would bend if we touched them; 
their flesh would yield, 
and all arrangements topple. 

But see how they bring toward us 
the old, sustaining gestures — 
a stride, an arm outstretched — 
the furrows in the smiles 
deepen, and the red lips smear. 

Great captains command, obedient 
ranks go down. In all these propped 
assemblies I know a substance 
neither wax nor wholly flesh — 
a tried and mortal nature, 
familiar as the warmth in my hand. 


       XII 

Were we not lost, condemned 
to repeat these names 
and to honor their crimes, 
a voice among us might cry out, 
speak to those who are 
stopped here: 
                     Whose faces are these 
that melt and run? 

Children and guardians, giants 
and dwarfs — 
                   Oh, people, people... 
Who are these heroes 
and where are their victims? 

We who are standing here 
with our guidebooks suddenly closed 
and all the exits darkened... 

Until another gallery opens, 
or the sun through that skylight 
strikes us all — 
                     souls in torment, 
pilgrims and doting fathers...

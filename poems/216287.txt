Camille Corot's painting, stolen from the Louvre, May 1998
It might have always been meant 
 that they walked completely away, 
 this man on horse, woman with basket. 
 With their backs to us and the painter, 
 they are so private. But like those stories 
 where children step right into a picture 
 and, looking over their shoulders, 
 see the consoling frame, 
 these two would know the way home 
 like the palms of their hands, the routine 
 so ordinary it most encloses, 
 no need for thought, only motion 
 and the full sensation of sun 
 on your flesh, along the usual road.

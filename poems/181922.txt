The Logic of Contradictions
A logical principle is said to be an empty 
or formal proposition because it can add 
nothing to the premises of the argument it 
governs. This leads to the logic of contra- 
dictions. It is an anacoluthon to say that 
a proposition is impossible because it is 
self-contradictory. (It is also ambiguous.) 
The definition of the possible as that which 
in a given state of information (real or 
pretended) we do not know not to be true 
conceals another anacoluthon.

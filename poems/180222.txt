title : Innocence and Experience

author : Anne Stevenson

text : 
I laid myself down as a woman 
And woke as a child. 
Sleep buried me up to my chin, 
But my brain cut wild. 

Sudden summer lay sticky as tar 
Under bare white feet. 
Stale, soot-spotted heapings of winter 
Shrank in the street. 

Black headlines, infolded like napkins, 
Crashed like grenades 
As war beat its way porch by porch 
Up New Haven's fa√ßades. 

Europe: a brown hive of noises, 
Hitler inside. 
On the sunny shelf by the stairs 
My tadpoles died. 

Big boys had already decided 
Who'd lose and who'd score, 
Singing one potato, two potato, 
Three potato, four. 

Singing sticks and stones 
May break my bones 
(but names hurt more). 

Singing step on a crack 
Break your mother's back 
(her platinum-ringed finger). 

Singing who got up your mother 
When your daddy wasn't there? 
Singing allee allee in free! You're 
Dead, you're dead, wherever you are!

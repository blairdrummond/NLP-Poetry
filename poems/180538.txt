title : cruel, cruel summer

author : D. A. Powell

text : 
either the postagestamp-bright inflorescence of wild mustard 
or the drab tassel of prairie smoke, waving its dirty garments 

either the low breeze through the cracked window 
or houseflies and drawn blinds to spare us the calid sun 

one day commands the next to lie down, to scatter:      we're done 
with allegiance, devotion, the malicious idea of what's eternal 

picture the terrain sunk, return of the inland sea, your spectacle 
your metaphor, the scope of this twiggy dominion pulled under 

crest and crest, wave and cloud, the thunder blast and burst of swells 
this is the sum of us:      brief sneezeweed, brief yellow blaze put out 

so little, your departure, one plunk upon the earth's surface, 
one drop to bind the dust, a little mud, a field of mud 

the swale gradually submerged, gradually forgotten 
and that is all that is to be borne of your empirical trope: 

first, a congregated light, the brilliance of a meadowland in bloom 
and then the image must fail, as we must fail, as we 

graceless creatures that we are, unmake and befoul our beds 
don't tell me deluge.      don't tell me heat, too damned much heat

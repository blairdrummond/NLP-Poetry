Poems for Weddings



I 
Love me Sweet, with all thou art, 
   Feeling, thinking, seeing; 
Love me in the lightest part, 
   Love me in full being. 

II 
Love me with thine open youth 
   In its frank surrender; 
With the vowing of thy mouth, 
   With its silence tender. 

III 
Love me with thine azure eyes, 
   Made for earnest granting; 
Taking colour from the skies, 
   Can Heaven's truth be wanting? 

IV 
Love me with their lids, that fall 
   Snow-like at first meeting; 
Love me with thine heart, that all 
   Neighbours then see beating. 

V 
Love me with thine hand stretched out 
   Freely--open-minded: 
Love me with thy loitering foot,-- 
   Hearing one behind it. 

VI 
Love me with thy voice, that turns 
   Sudden faint above me; 
Love me with thy blush that burns 
   When I murmur Love me! 

VII 
Love me with thy thinking soul, 
   Break it to love-sighing; 
Love me with thy thoughts that roll 
   On through living--dying. 

VIII 
Love me when in thy gorgeous airs, 
   When the world has crowned thee; 
Love me, kneeling at thy prayers, 
   With the angels round thee. 

IX 
Love me pure, as musers do, 
   Up the woodlands shady: 
Love me gaily, fast and true 
   As a winsome lady. 

X 
Through all hopes that keep us brave, 
   Farther off or nigher, 
Love me for the house and grave, 
   And for something higher. 

XI 
Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear, 
   Woman's love no fable. 
I will love thee--half a year-- 
   As a man is able.

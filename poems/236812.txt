Holy Trinity Airship
billows a

chrys-
elephantine
cave Louis Sullivan, Arch-
itect, lord master,
conceived of
in the hollow of power.

He swells.
I am his balloonist
balancing an azimuth

as earth-apse I
orbit, robed in
hot gas & leather

fastened by a yolk-stalk
of gravity to gold-
end onions nozzling heavens

whose suns are stomachs
with churches in their navels.

Each we are priests
as aeronauts at the vestibules,
& enter the cavity:

space, self, organ; celest-

ial nave 
bellies 

stars sailors name saints
and adore—

their egress is bitter
weeping, their praise pure
Russian form:

a cathedral,
my inner orrery.

Love, Heartache & Loss



after Sappho
Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, 
Except these kisses of my lips on thine 
Brand them with immortality; but me - 
Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, 
Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold 
Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold 
And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, 
Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind 
Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown, 
But in the light and laughter, in the moan 
And music, and in grasp of lip and hand 
And shudder of water that makes felt on land 
The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, 
Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.

title : The Reckoning

author : Robert W. Service

text : 
It’s fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant, 
With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want; 
To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass, 
Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass. 
It’s bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill, 
But it’s quite another matter when you 
                                                                         Pay the bill. 

It’s great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent; 
To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent; 
To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip; 
To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip; 
To know you’re acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still, 
Till Nature calls a show-down, and you 
                                                                         Pay the bill. 

Time has got a little bill — get wise while yet you may, 
For the debit side’s increasing in a most alarming way; 
The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done, 
They’re all put down; it’s up to you to pay for every one. 
So eat, drink and be merry, have a good time if you will, 
But God help you when the time comes, and you 
                                                                         Foot the bill.

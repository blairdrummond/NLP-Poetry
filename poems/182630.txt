text : 
I smell me   
coming up behind me 
some days— 
sweet sarcophagal 

history. The Ark 
after the beasts   
disembarked, 
the motel bed 

as the maid draws 
the shades, shakes the sheets, 
blinks back the stink, 
the leafed hollow 

where the stalled mower   
sits in its exhaust   
and smells of wronged 
flesh, wing, meat   

but me mostly, 
climbing the steps, 
extract of me, 
stinking of me.

Whether on the boulevard or gravel backroad, 
I do not easily raise my hand to those who toss 
up theirs in anonymous hello, merely to say 
“I’m passing this way.” Once out of shyness, now 
reluctance to tip my hand, I admire the shrubbery 
instead. I’ve learned where the lines are drawn 
and keep the privet well trimmed. I left one house 
with toys on the floor for another with quiet rugs 
and a bed where the moon comes in. I’ve thrown 
myself at men in black turtlenecks only to find 
that home is best after all. Home where I sit 
in the glider, knowing it needs oil, like my own 
rusty joints. Where I coax blackberry to dogwood 
and winter to harvest, where my table is clothed 
in light. Home where I walk out on the thin page 
of night, without waving or giving myself away, 
and return with my words burning like fire in the grate.

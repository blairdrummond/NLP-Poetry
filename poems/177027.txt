title : To Myself

author : Franz Wright

text : 
You are riding the bus again 
burrowing into the blackness of Interstate 80,   
the sole passenger 

with an overhead light on.   
And I am with you. 
I’m the interminable fields you can’t see, 

the little lights off in the distance   
(in one of those rooms we are   
living) and I am the rain 

and the others all 
around you, and the loneliness you love, 
and the universe that loves you specifically, maybe, 

and the catastrophic dawn, 
the nicotine crawling on your skin— 
and when you begin 

to cough I won’t cover my face, 
and if you vomit this time I will hold you:   
everything’s going to be fine 

I will whisper. 
It won’t always be like this. 
I am going to buy you a sandwich.

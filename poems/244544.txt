text : 
a rooftop has an enemy
  
 an owl
  
 a cone of confusion
  
  
 scansion of acoustics
  
 or before sound
  
 a crematorium
  
  
 visually unresolved
  
 (before)           remains
  
  
 leaves that only look
  
 like the birds
  
 between them
  
  
 physiology limits
 visual memory
  
  
 ash or     bodies
 in glass

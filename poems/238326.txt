title : Back Then

author : Trish Crapo

text : 
Out in the yard, my sister and I 
tore thread from century plants 
to braid into bracelets, ate 
chalky green bananas, 
threw coconuts onto the sidewalk 
to crack their hard, hairy skulls. 
 
The world had begun to happen, 
but not time. We would live 
forever, sunburnt and pricker-stuck, 
our promises written in blood. Not yet 
 
would men or illness distinguish us, 
our thoughts cleave us in two. 
If she squeezed sour calamondins 
into a potion, I drank it. When I jumped 
from the fig tree, she jumped.

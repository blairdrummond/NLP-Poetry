By any measure, it was endless
             winter. Emulsions with
Then circled the lake like
This is it. This April will be
Inadequate sensitivity to green. I rose
early, erased for an hour
             Silk-brush and ax
I'd like to think I'm a different person
             latent image fading

around the edges and ears
             Overall a tighter face
now. Is it so hard for you to understand
From the drop-down menu
In a cluster of eight poems, I selected
sleep, but could not
             I decided to change everything
Composed entirely of stills
             or fade into the trees

but could not
             remember the dream
save for one brief shot
of a woman opening her eyes
Ari, pick up. I'm a different person
In a perfect world, this would be
             April, or an associated concept
Green to the touch
             several feet away

title : For Efessos

author : Odysseus Elytis

text : 
Freely beside me the vineyards are running and unbridled 
Remains the sky. Wildfires trade pinecones and one 
Donkey bolts uphill 
               for a little cloud 
St. Heracleitos’s day and something’s up 
That even noses can’t diagnose: 
Tricks of a shoeless wind snagging the hem 
Of Fate’s nightgown and leaving 
Us in the open air of capricorns 
               exposed 
Secretly I go with all the loot in my mind 
For a life unbowed from the beginning. No candles no 
               chandeliers 
Only a gold anemone’s engagement for a diamond 
Feeling its way to where? Asking what? Our moon’s half- 
               shadow needs 
You to console even the graves 
Homoethnic or not. The crux is that the scent of earth 
Lost even to bloodhounds 
With its weeds onions and creeks 
Must be restored to its idiom 

So what! A word contains you peasant of night’s green 
Efessos! Forefather sulphur phosphorus your fourteenth 
               generation 
Inside the orange groves gold words 
Sharing the scalpel’s chisel 
Tents as yet unpitched 
                           others midair 
Lost poles suddenly grinding. Sermons 
Rise from the seafloor of the facing coves 
Twin scythes for theater or temple 
Fresh valley springs and other curly streams 
Of thus and so. If ever wisdom 
Planned circles of clover and dog grass 
Another world might live just as before 
               your fingerprint 

Letters will exist. People will read and grab 
History’s tail once more. Just let the vineyards gallop and the sky 
               remain 
Unbridled as children want it 
With roosters and pinecones and blue kites 
               flags 
On Saint Heracleitos’s day 
                                       child’s is the kingdom.

					They have little use. They are best as objects of torment.          No government cares what you do with them.           Like birds, and yet so human . . .          They mate by briefly looking at the other.          Their eggs are like white jellybeans.           Sometimes they have been said to inspire a man to do more with his life than he might have.          But what is there for a man to do with his life?           . . . They burn beautifully with a blue flame.           When they cry out it is like the screech of a tiny hinge; the cry of a bat. No one hears it . . .

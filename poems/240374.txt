title : Are We There Yet?

author : Dobby Gibson

You only have to make her one grilled cheese
 in the suffocating heat of summer
 while still wearing your wet swim trunks
 to know what it’s like to be in love.
 And you only have to sit once
 for a haircut in the air conditioning
 with the lovely stylist to forget all about it,
 and to forget that anything in the universe 
 ever existed prior to the small, pink sweater
 now brushing softly against your neck.
 In this world, every birth is premature.
 How else to explain all of this silence,
 all of this screaming,
 all of those Christmas card letters
 about how well the kids are doing in school?
 We’re all struggling to say the same old things
 in new and different ways.
 And so we must praise the new and different ways.
 I don’t like Christmas.
 I miss you that much.
 For I, too, have heard the screaming,
 and I, too, have tried to let it pass,
 and still I’ve been up half the night
 as if I were half this old,
 and like you, I hate this kind of poetry
 just as much as my life depends upon it.
 They’re giving away tiny phones for free these days,
 but they’ve only made
 a decent conversation more precious.
 One medicine stops the swelling,
 another medicine stops the first medicine.
 Just like you, I entered this world
 made and kicking, and without you,
 it’s precisely how I intend to go.

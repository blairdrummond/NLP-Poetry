I 

Geography matters. 
It is the plan, 
the arrangement of things 
that confuses our enemies, 
the difference between what 
they expect and what they get; 
as simple as bobbing for apples 
becomes difficult, deception is 
an achievement in ordering the obvious. 


II 

Let us make a song 
for our confusion: 
Call it “Red Skies over Gary” 
or “Red Skies in the Sunset” 
or “Red Skies and the Open Hearth.” 

    Red Skies over Gary,   
    you are my sunset,   
    my only home. 

Let us make ourselves invisible, 
not make songs, or even   
disappear suddenly from   
the sidewalks of Calumet.

Cobalt and carborundum   
are refinements of the art. 

So it’s true, you held   
the razor in your teeth,   
or was it pure magic,   
a miracle of place? 
One makes for workability,   
the other for hardness,   
and chromium bright,   
the stainless achievement. 


IV 

I came from Calumet to Gary,   
and it was early evening; 
south of the mills, poppy fields   
toxic red above the car lots,   
have a Coke on Texaco 
’til the mercury arcs devour us   
and it is purple night.

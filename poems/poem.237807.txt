'They toil not, neither do they spin.'
One morn before me were three figures seen, 
    With bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced; 
And one behind the other stepp'd serene, 
    In placid sandals, and in white robes graced; 
        They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn, 
    When shifted round to see the other side; 
They came again; as when the urn once more 
        Is shifted round, the first seen shades return; 
    And they were strange to me, as may betide 
With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.

How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not? 
    How came ye muffled in so hush a mask? 
Was it a silent deep-disguised plot 
    To steal away, and leave without a task 
        My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour; 
    The blissful cloud of summer-indolence 
Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less; 
        Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower: 
    O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense 
Unhaunted quite of all but--nothingness?

A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd 
    Each one the face a moment whiles to me; 
Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd 
    And ached for wings, because I knew the three; 
        The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name; 
    The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, 
And ever watchful with fatigued eye; 
        The last, whom I love more, the more of blame 
    Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,-- 
I knew to be my demon Poesy.

They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings: 
    O folly! What is Love? and where is it? 
And for that poor Ambition! it springs 
    From a man's little heart's short fever-fit; 
        For Poesy!--no,--she has not a joy,-- 
    At least for me,--so sweet as drowsy noons, 
And evenings steep'd in honey'd indolence; 
        O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy, 
    That I may never know how change the moons, 
Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!

 And once more came they by:--alas! wherefore? 
     My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams; 
 My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er 
     With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: 
        The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, 
     Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; 
The open casement press'd a new-leaved vine, 
     Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay; 
        O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell! 
Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.

So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise 
    My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; 
For I would not be dieted with praise, 
    A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce! 
        Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more 
    In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; 
Farewell! I yet have visions for the night, 
    And for the day faint visions there is store; 
Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright, 
    Into the clouds, and never more return!

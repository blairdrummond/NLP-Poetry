title : Valentine's Afternoon

author : Michael McFee

text : 
Four lanes over, a plump helium heart—   

slipped, maybe, from some kid's wrist                
or a rushed lover's empty front seat   

through a half-cracked car window—   

rises like a shiny purple cloudlet   
toward today's gray mess of clouds,   

trailing its gold ribbon like lightning   

that will never strike anything   
or anyone here on the forsaken ground,   

its bold LOVE increasingly illegible   

as it ascends over the frozen oaks,   
riding swift currents toward the horizon,   

a swollen word wobbling out of sight.

title : In the God’s Dreams

Am I a character in the dreams 
of the god Hermes the messenger?   
Certainly many of my dreams   
have nothing to do with the   
common life around me. There   
are never any automobiles or   
airplanes in them. These   
dreams belong to an age in   
the distant past, to a time   
perhaps when nothing was   
written down, to the 
time of memory. 

I chose Hermes not out of   
vanity but because from what   
I’ve read about him he had a   
pretty good time, was not   
just a drunkard on Olympus.   
In his traipsings delivering   
divine messages he must have   
met some pretty girls who   
gave him pleasure. We know   
that he invented the lyre   
for the benefit of poets,   
and Lucian relates in his   
Dialogues of the Dead that   
he was the god of sleep 
and dreams. 

My dreams are not frightening,   
they are not nightmares. But   
their irrationality puzzles 
me. What is Hermes trying to 
tell me? Is he playing a game   
with me? Last Monday night   
I dreamt about a school for   
young children who had heads   
but no bodies. Last night it   
was a cow that was galloping   
in our meadow like a horse.   
Another night, and this one   
was a bit scary, I swam across   
the lake with my head under   
water, I didn’t have to breathe air. 

What is the message of these   
dreams? Into what kind of world   
is Hermes leading me? It’s not   
the world described daily in the   
New York Times. A world of   
shadows? A kind of levitation? 

How can I pray to Hermes to lay   
off these senseless fantasies, 
tell him that I want real dreams   
such as my shrink can explicate. 

I’ve looked up lustration in 
the dictionary. Its definition 
is not encouraging: “a prefatory   
ceremony, performed as a preliminary   
to entering a holy place.” That’s 
too impersonal. I want a man-to-man   
talk with Hermes, telling him to   
stop infesting my nights with 
his nonsense.

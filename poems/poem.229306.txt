Ode, Couplet

All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, 
He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. 
He is a man of genius bright, 
And in him his congregation does delight, 
Because they find him to be honest and plain, 
Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. 
He preaches in a plain straightforward way, 
The people flock to hear him night and day, 
And hundreds from the doors are often turn'd away, 
Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. 
He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, 
And while he lives he will never be forgot, 
Nor when he is dead, 
Because by his admirers it will be often read; 
And fill their minds with wonder and delight, 
And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter's night. 
He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, 
Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, 
Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, 
And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, 
And in that he is always right, 
For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, 
Do it with all your might. 
Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, 
And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, 
Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when 
You are dead they shall not look upon your like again.

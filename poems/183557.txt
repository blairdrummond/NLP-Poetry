I do not understand why men make war.

Is it because artillery is the most stoic example 
of what flesh can become? 
Is it because the military plan is the final map 
drawn by the wisest hunter? 
Is it because the neutron ray is the invincible finger 
no one will disobey? 

or 

Is it because the flood of blood is the proper penance 
workers must pay for failing tribute at the prescribed 
hour? 

I do not understand why men make war. 

Is it because when death is multiple and expanding, there 
among the odd assemblages, arbitrary and unnamed, there 
among the shrivelled mountains, distorted and hollow, there 
among the liquid farms and cities, cold and sallow, there 
among the splintered bones of children, women, men and cattle 
there and only there, the eerie head of power is being born? 

Is it because submission is the only gesture to be rehearsed, 
to be dressed, to be modeled, to be cast, to be chosen 
in the one and only one drama to be staged in the theater of   
this world, where everyone must act with the backbone humbled 
with the mascara of bondage, with the lipstick of slaves under 
the light of gentle assassination with applause piercing the ground 
forever? 

or 

Is it because war is the secret room of all things to be kept   
sealed and contained, to be conquered and renamed woman 
enclosed by an empire of walls, vaults, hinges and locks with 
the hot key that men and only men must possess for an eternal 
evening to visit and contemplate, to snap open a favorite window 
and gaze at the calibrated murder as lovers of beauty?

title : Old Woman in a Housecoat

author : Georgiana Cohen

text : 
An old woman in 
a floor-length housecoat 
had become sunset 
to me, west-facing. 
Turquoise, sage, or rose, 
she leans out of her 
second floor window, 
chin slumped in her palm, 
and gazes at the 
fenced property line 
between us, the cars 
beached in the driveway, 
the creeping slide of 
light across shingles. 
When the window shuts, 
dusk becomes blush and 
bruises, projected 
on vinyl siding. 
Housecoats breathe across 
the sky like frail clouds.

With a timorous heart thou didst try to steal these trifles from the turbulent stream of time which washes away planets and stars, and didst say, a??These are only mine!a?? Alas, there is no one now who can claim thema??who is able to pay their price; yet they are still here. Is there no love in this world to rescue thee from utter loss, even like this love of thine that saved these letters with such fond care?         O woman, thou camest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great mystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creationa??she who ever gives back to God his own outflow of sweetness; who is the eternal love and beauty and youth; who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light; who with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain; in whom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and overflows in the pain of love.

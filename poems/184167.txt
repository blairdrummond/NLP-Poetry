title : Constantly Risking Absurdity (#15)

author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti

text : 
Constantly risking absurdity 
                                             and death 
            whenever he performs 
                                        above the heads 
                                                            of his audience 
   the poet like an acrobat 
                                 climbs on rime 
                                          to a high wire of his own making 
and balancing on eyebeams 
                                     above a sea of faces 
             paces his way 
                               to the other side of day 
    performing entrechats 
                               and sleight-of-foot tricks 
 and other high theatrics 
                               and all without mistaking 
                     any thing 
                               for what it may not be 

       For he's the super realist 
                                     who must perforce perceive 
                   taut truth 
                                 before the taking of each stance or step 
 in his supposed advance 
                                  toward that still higher perch 
where Beauty stands and waits 
                                     with gravity 
                                                to start her death-defying leap 

      And he 
             a little charleychaplin man 
                                           who may or may not catch 
               her fair eternal form 
                                     spreadeagled in the empty air 
                  of existence

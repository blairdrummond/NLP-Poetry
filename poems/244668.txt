title : Before Anything Happened the House Had No Skeleton

author : Karyna McGlynn

text : 
the termites had deboned the thing
 it was clean there was no saving it
  
 in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers
 its peg-legs rested on pure membrane
  
 a girl just stood in her underwear
 ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs
  
 thought greyhound no one knew no explaining
 why she didn’t fall through the floor
  
 the kids were drinking beer in the yard
 the tetherball rope caught one girl’s throat
  
 her mother’s face obscured
 behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow
  
 no one could make her out
 her feet rested on hot sashes of dust
  
 the sounds on the television were far away
 as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man
  
 the president got shot
 the boards stayed together for another three days
  
 it was a matter of apathy or swelling
 or everyone was too hot to move

title : Valentine, Valentine

author : Landis Everson

text : 
Valentine, valentine you arrive 
in a town car with a chauffered envelope, 
scattered pieces of you enrolled in schoolyards 
like a recess of paper vanity, litter, old 
with red-rimmed "loves," red-rhymed lies in lace. 

The verses come, rising as easily as long-stemmed snakes in 
bloom where swamps settle down and drowse 
by dawn, a night of secrets slid out of drawers like knives nesting, a choice of chimes and slums overrun 
by bejeweled heartbreakers. What a lovely 
winter, almost skipping February.

title : Image of the Engine

Likely as not a ruined head gasket 
Spitting at every power stroke, if not a crank shaft 
Bearing knocking at the roots of the thing like a pile-driver:   
A machine involved with itself, a concentrated 
Hot lump of a machine 
Geared in the loose mechanics of the world with the valves jumping 
And the heavy frenzy of the pistons. When the thing stops,   
Is stopped, with the last slow cough 
In the manifold, the flywheel blundering 
Against compression, stopping, finally 
Stopped, compression leaking 
From the idle cylinders will one imagine 
Then because he can imagine 
That squeezed from the cooling steel 
There hovers in that moment, wraith-like and like a plume of steam, an aftermath, 
A still and quiet angel of knowledge and of comprehension.

Endlessly, endlessly, 
The definition of mortality 

The image of the engine 

That stops. 
We cannot live on that. 
I know that no one would live out 
Thirty years, fifty years if the world were ending   
With his life. 
The machine stares out, 
Stares out 
With all its eyes 

Thru the glass 
With the ripple in it, past the sill 
Which is dusty—If there is someone 
In the garden! 
Outside, and so beautiful.

What ends 
Is that. 
          Even companionship   
Ending. 

‘I want to ask if you remember 
When we were happy! As tho all travels 

Ended untold, all embarkations   
Foundered.

On that water 
Grey with morning 
The gull will fold its wings   
And sit. And with its two eyes   
There as much as anything 
Can watch a ship and all its hallways 
And all companions sink.

Also he has set the world 
In their hearts. From lumps, chunks, 

We are locked out: like children, seeking love 
At last among each other. With their first full strength   
The young go search for it, 

Native in the native air.
But even the beautiful bony children 
Who arise in the morning have left behind   
Them worn and squalid toys in the trash 

Which is a grimy death of love. The lost 
Glitter of the stores!   
The streets of stores! 
Crossed by the streets of stores 
And every crevice of the city leaking 
Rubble: concrete, conduit, pipe, a crumbling 
Rubble of our roots 

                            But they will find 
In flood, storm, ultimate mishap:   
Earth, water, the tremendous 
Surface, the heart thundering 
Absolute desire.

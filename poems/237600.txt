title : Prisoner in a Hole

author : Sholeh Wolpé

text : 
Barely twenty-five, he smells
of yesterday’s spit and vomit,
 black beard droops in clumps
 from his drawn, sun-savaged face. 

 Hanging from a string
 around his neck: a small holy book.

 This man was once a child
 held against the breast of a mother
 who kissed his small meaty hands
 that smelled of milk and tears.

title : Hog Island Oysters

author : Devin Johnston

text : 
Oysters adhere 
to things, no eyes: 

spat on the smooth 
curve of a pier 

they feel shadows   
and snap shut. 

The sun wavers 
while anchored below 

each distills 
Tomales Bay, 

accreting waves 
within its shell. 

Voluptuous and cold, 
Kumamoto trembles 

on a thin fork, 
liquefaction 

of cloud. Rain 
distorts glass, 

our tavern submerged 
all afternoon.

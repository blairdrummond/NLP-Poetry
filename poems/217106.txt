title : Three Poets

author : Robert West

text : 
1. THE PLAGIARIST   

Careless of his debts, he never credits   
submissions to the magazine he edits.   


2. THE   TAXIDERMIST   

Her father's dead at last, the lout—   
but now he's all she writes about.   

3. THE ASSASSIN   

His verse means less to the world of letters   
than the bad reviews he gives his betters.

text : 
Seeing in crowded restaurants the one you love   
You wave at the door, tall girl in imperious fur, 
And make for him, bumping waiters, dropping a glove,   
Arriving soft with affectionate slur. 
As ladies half-turn, gazing, and men appraise 
You heap the linen with purse, scarf, cigarettes, lighter,   
Laughing some instantaneous droll phrase. 
As if sudden sun came out, the table is brighter. 

All moods: at a party everybody’s delight; 
Intent while brown curls shadow the serious page;   
When people are stuffy (more correct than right)   
The stamp and turn on heel of a little girl’s rage.   
But woman mostly, as winter moonlight sees,   
Impetuous midnight, and the dune’s dark trees.

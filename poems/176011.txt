title : the garden of delight

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
for some 
it is stone 
bare smooth   
as a buttock   
rounding 
into the crevasse 
of the world 

for some 
it is extravagant 
water   mouths wide   
washing together   
forever   for some   
it is fire 
for some air 

and for some 
certain only of the syllables   
it is the element they 
search their lives for 

eden 

for them   
it is a test

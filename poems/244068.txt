title : Parchment, Please

Near the year
1000
we find
Maximos Planudes
nude
writing to a friend
in Asia Minor
asking for parchment
because the right quality
is not for sale
in his own neighborhood,
presumably Constantinople.
 
In the end,
all he receives
are some asses’ skins,
which do not please
him in the least,
and a note:
 
                                                      Dear Max,
 
                                                      No parchment
                                                      till the summer,
                                                      months after the population
                                                      begins to eat meat.
                                                      Low yield
                                                      should come as no surprise,
                                                      our medieval animals
                                                      being much smaller
                                                      than their modern
                                                      counterparts.
 
                                                      Love,
                                                      A. Minor

title : Love Poem

author : Duane Niatum

text : 
The twilight of your face,
the unknown bird in your voice,
draws me again to your eyes’ green vision,

your song about that longest
moment, a moon vulnerability,
a Natalie I saw alone,

at Carolyn’s party years ago,
where you called me to your side,
and I held my heart, cupped in shadow,

as an offering to your smile,
our soft-spoken isolation.

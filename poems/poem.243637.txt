Free Verse


Fair enough: you people have eaten me,
I--wrote you down.
They'll lay you out on a dinner table,
me--on this desk.

I've been happy with little.
There are dishes I've never tried.
But you, you people eat slowly, and often;
You eat and eat.

Everything was decided for us
back in the ocean:
Our places of action,
our places of gratitude.

You--with belches, I--with books,
with truffles, you. With pencil, I,
you and your olives, me and my rhyme,
with pickles, you. I, with poems.

At your head--funeral candles
like thick-legged asparagus:
your road out of this world
a dessert table's striped cloth.

They will smoke Havana cigars
on your left side and your right;
your body will be dressed
in the best Dutch linen.

And--not to waste such expensive cloth,
they will shake you out,
along with the crumbs and bits of food,
into the hole, the grave.

You--stuffed capon, I--pigeon.
Gunpowder, your soul, at the autopsy.
And I will be laid out bare
with only two wings to cover me.


Late July 1933

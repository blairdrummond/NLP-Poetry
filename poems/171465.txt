Did you ever have a family?    
                                                    Dark   
dining room, 
                  bright kitchen, 
                                        white steam 
from the big pot my mother’s stirring   
reaching in wavy tendrils to her face,   
around her face, all the way around   
to me at the table, then beyond me   
into the darkness where my brother is. 

Were you ever a child? 
                                             I’m hungry   
but I know we’ll 
                         eat soon,      
                                           so 
even the hunger’s sweet. 

Did you ever really have a brother? 
                                                                  He’s singing   
there in the dark 
                           corner 
                                     beside the stereo, 
the volume turned down so low   
all we hear is him, his voice, and   
his eyes are closed so that there’s   
nothing around him anywhere 
that might reveal he isn’t 
who the song insists he is. 

And that is? 
                           Irresistible, 
unforgettable,         
                            someone         
                                              to whom   
as in imaginary gardens 
where “the nectarine and curious 
peach into my hands themselves 
do reach,” love comes as soon 
as called, comes just as dreamed. 

Did any of this ever happen? 
                                                    The hunger’s 
sweet, 
          it’s as if 
                           the song weaves 
through the fragrance of the braiding   
steam from him to me to her 
to me to him because her eyes 
are closed now too; her 
slippered feet tap, caper 
a soft shoe while the ladle 
sways in her hand as she stirs. 

Were you ever a child? 
                                             I know 
I’ll eat soon.         
                           Did you ever really have a brother? 
You should have       
                            heard him,    
                                              his voice was   
unforgettable, irresistible, his voice 
was an imaginary garden woven through with fragrance.   

Did you ever have a family? 
                                                   Their eyes are closed.   
That’s how I know      
                              we’re there    
                                                   inside it,   
it’s made of sound and steam 
that weaves between dark 
dining room, bright kitchen.   
We’re there because I’m hungry,   
and we’ll all be eating soon 
together, and the hunger’s sweet.

title : Reunion

author : Jeff Daniel Marion

text : 
Last night in a dream 
you came to me. We were young 
again and you were smiling, 
happy in the way a sparrow in spring 
hops from branch to branch. 
I took you in my arms 
and swung you about, so carefree 
was my youth. 

What can I say? 
That time wears away, draws its lines 
on every feature? That we wake 
to dark skies whose only answer 
is rain, cold as the years 
that stretch behind us, blurring 
this window far from you.

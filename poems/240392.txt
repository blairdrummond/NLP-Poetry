Rocked in my mother’s pregnant amble,
 and born into forty-five years in the dark,
 the egg this child was also swayed in the arts
 of lovers I took before you, fed with me
  
 in the public markets of Baltimore and Denpasar
 on oysters and rambutan, woke with me each year
 to new waves of wander, fish and flower,
 liqueur of each region, and bread of each village,
  
 each cup of moonlight in the long sward
 between my window and the Wannsee.
 The egg he was heard and voices
 of everyone I desired and held itself
  
 in some deep hormonal bloom,
 taking whatever was remarkable
 in my life into its possibility.
 We learned not to hurry in Balinese rain,
  
 to listen for the rumble of wild boar
 in the Malvan woods. We climbed
 into planes bound for cities we’d never
 visit again and skin we’d summon
  
 with sobbing. And so, my husband,
 as you dream of owning this child,
 remember that he has ridden in my fire,
 bathed in my blood, and sipped
  
 at the breath I drew the first 
 time I saw what Rodin had clawed
 from stone before he turned from Claudel
 and went home for dinner and a clean shirt.
  
 Remember that this child is collage
 of everything before you, frangipani
 and escargot, five-for-a-dollar boxes
 of macaroni, and French cherries
  
 from an old woman in Auvergne
 who insisted on the gift
 because it was so marvelous
 to see a woman traveling alone.

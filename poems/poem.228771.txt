Rhymed Stanza, Series/Sequence

Old Yew, which graspest at the stones 
         That name the under-lying dead, 
         Thy fibres net the dreamless head, 
Thy roots are wrapt about the bones. 

The seasons bring the flower again, 
         And bring the firstling to the flock; 
         And in the dusk of thee, the clock 
Beats out the little lives of men. 

O not for thee the glow, the bloom, 
         Who changest not in any gale, 
         Nor branding summer suns avail 
To touch thy thousand years of gloom: 

And gazing on thee, sullen tree, 
         Sick for thy stubborn hardihood, 
         I seem to fail from out my blood 
And grow incorporate into thee.

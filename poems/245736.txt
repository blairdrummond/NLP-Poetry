title : Section 29 from 'Draft 85: Hard Copy'

text : 
So she stole her father’s teraphim.
 What, in the name of monotheism,
 was that about?
  
 Those rare black stones.
 Sacred knick-knacks, idols,
 symbolic lion grabbed at that got chipped,
 cover them with the ass of female claim,
 settle in for the duration, and refuse
 (“being in the way of women”)
 to rise.
  
 Say you are neither disloyal nor pilferer.
 And sit tight on the icons and rocks of meaning
 gathered from the paternal household,
 the talismanic counterfoils, even
 the fewest and smallest
 from the fierce storehouses of articulation
 and defensiveness.
 You will remake these goods in your own blood
  
 “I didn’t take enough.”
 “So go get more.”
 Tokens from the broken labyrinth.

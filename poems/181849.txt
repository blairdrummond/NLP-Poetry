title : Spring A. D.

author : George Seferis

text : 
Again with spring 
she wore light colours 
and with gentle steps 
again with spring 
again in summer 
she was smiling. 

Among fresh blossoms 
breast naked to the veins 
beyond the dry night 
beyond the white old men 
debating quietly 
whether it would be better 
to give up the keys 
or to pull the rope 
and hang from the noose 
to leave empty bodies 
there where souls couldn’t endure 
there where the mind couldn’t catch up 
and knees buckled. 

With the new blossoms 
the old men failed 
and gave up on everything 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
the broad fields 
the green mountains 
love and life 
compassion and shelter 
rivers and sea; 
and they departed like statues 
leaving behind a silence 
that no sword could cut 
that no gallop could break 
nor the voices of the young; 
and the great loneliness came 
the great privation 
along with this spring 
and settled and spread 
like the frost of dawn 
caught hold of the high branches 
slid down the trunks of trees 
and wrapped around our soul. 

But she smiled 
wearing light colours 
like a blossoming almond tree 
in yellow flames 
and walked along lightly 
opening windows 
in the delighted sky 
without us the luckless ones. 
And I saw her breast naked 
the waist and the knee, 
as the inviolate martyr 
inviolate and pure 
issues from the torment 
to go to heaven, 
beyond the inexplicable 
whispering of people 
in the boundless circus 
beyond the black grimace 
the sweaty neck 
of the exasperated executioner 
striking vainly. 

The loneliness now a lake 
the privation now a lake 
untouched and untraceable.

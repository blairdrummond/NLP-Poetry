title : from V. Elegy for the AIDS Virus

How difficult it is to say goodbye
 to scourge. For years we were obsessed with you,
 your complex glycoproteins and your sly,
 haphazard reproduction, your restraint
 in your resistance, how you bathed so slight
 yet fierce in our most intimate secretions.
 We will remember you for generations;
 electron micrographs of you seem quaint
 already, in the moment of our victory.
 How difficult it is to claim one’s right
 to living honestly. The honesty
 you taught was nothing quite as true
  
 as death, but neither was it final. Yes, 
 we vanquished you, with latex, protease
 inhibitors, a little common sense—
 what’s that, you say? That some remain at risk?
 How dare you try to threaten us again!
 Of course, you’d like to make outrageous claims 
 that some behaviors haven’t changed, that some 
 have not had access to the drugs that mask
 your presence in the body. Difficult
 it is, how very sad, to see you strain
 (no pun intended) at response—our quilts,
 our bravest poetry, our deaths with grace
  
 and dignity have put you in your place. 
 This elegy itself renounces you, 
 as from this consciousness you’ve been erased. 
 The love for you was very strong, the hot
 pursuits so many of us reveled in—
 but what once felt like love was really not. 
 I hardly know what I will find to hate
 as much as I have loved and hated what 
 you brought to bear upon my verse, the weight
 of your oppression and the joys of truth.
 How difficult it is—to face the white 
 of nothingness, of clarity. We win!

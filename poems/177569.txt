title : The Creature in the Classroom

It appeared inside our classroom 
at a quarter after ten, 
it gobbled up the blackboard, 
three erasers and a pen. 
It gobbled teacher's apple 
and it bopped her with the core. 
“How dare you!” she responded. 
“You must leave us . . . there's the door.” 

The Creature didn't listen 
but described an arabesque 
as it gobbled all her pencils, 
seven notebooks and her desk. 
Teacher stated very calmly, 
“Sir! You simply cannot stay, 
I'll report you to the principal 
unless you go away!” 

But the thing continued eating, 
it ate paper, swallowed ink, 
as it gobbled up our homework 
I believe I saw it wink. 
Teacher finally lost her temper. 
“OUT!” she shouted at the creature. 
The creature hopped beside her 
and GLOPP . . . it gobbled teacher.

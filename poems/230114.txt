title : Old Ironsides

author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

text : 
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! 
   Long has it waved on high, 
And many an eye has danced to see 
   That banner in the sky; 
Beneath it rung the battle shout, 
   And burst the cannon’s roar;— 
The meteor of the ocean air 
   Shall sweep the clouds no more! 

Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood 
   Where knelt the vanquished foe, 
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood 
   And waves were white below, 
No more shall feel the victor’s tread, 
   Or know the conquered knee;— 
The harpies of the shore shall pluck 
   The eagle of the sea! 

O, better that her shattered hulk 
   Should sink beneath the wave; 
Her thunders shook the mighty deep, 
   And there should be her grave; 
Nail to the mast her holy flag, 
   Set every thread-bare sail, 
And give her to the god of storms,— 
   The lightning and the gale!

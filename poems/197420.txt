title : When All My Five and Country Senses See

author : Dylan Thomas

text : 
When all my five and country senses see, 
The fingers will forget green thumbs and mark   
How, through the halfmoon’s vegetable eye,   
Husk of young stars and handfull zodiac, 
Love in the frost is pared and wintered by, 
The whispering ears will watch love drummed away   
Down breeze and shell to a discordant beach,   
And, lashed to syllables, the lynx tongue cry   
That her fond wounds are mended bitterly.   
My nostrils see her breath burn like a bush. 

My one and noble heart has witnesses 
In all love’s countries, that will grope awake; 
And when blind sleep drops on the spying senses,   
The heart is sensual, though five eyes break.

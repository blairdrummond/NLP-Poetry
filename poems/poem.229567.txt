Speed the Parting--

Living, Time & Brevity, Sorrow & Grieving, Death



I shall not sprinkle with dust 
A creature so clearly lunar; 
You must die--but of course you must-- 
And better later than sooner. 
But if it should be in a year 
That year itself must perish; 
How dingy a thing is fear, 
And sorrow, how dull to cherish! 
And if it should be in a day 
That day would be dark by evening, 
But the morning might still be gay 
And the moon have golden leavening. 
And beauty's a moonlight grist 
That comes to the mills of dying; 
The silver grain may be missed 
But there's no great good in crying. 
Though luminous things are mould 
They survive in a glance that crossed them, 
And it's not very kind to scold 
The empty air that has lost them. 
The limpid blossom of youth 
Turns into a poison berry; 
Having perceived this truth 
I shall not weep but be merry. 
Therefore die when you please; 
It's not very wise to worry; 
I shall not shiver and freeze; 
I shall not even be sorry. 
Beautiful things are wild; 
They are gone, and you go after; 
Therefore I mean, my child, 
To charm your going with laughter. 
Love and pity are strong, 
But wisdom is happily greater; 
You will die, I suppose, before long, 
Oh, worser sooner than later!

title : my dream about the second coming

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
mary is an old woman without shoes.   
she doesn’t believe it. 
not when her belly starts to bubble 
and leave the print of a finger where   
no man touches. 
not when the snow in her hair melts away.   
not when the stranger she used to wait for   
appears dressed in lights at her 
kitchen table. 
she is an old woman and 
doesn’t believe it. 

when Something drops onto her toes one night   
she calls it a fox 
but she feeds it.

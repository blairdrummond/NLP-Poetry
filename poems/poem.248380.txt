The End of the Second Year 
Arthur Graeme West 
1891-1917

England




One writes to ask me if I've read
Of "the Jutland battle," of "the great advance
Made by the Russians," chiding--"History
Is being made these days, these are the things
That are worth while."
                                          These!
                                                       Not to one who's lain
In Heaven before God's throne with eyes abased,
Worshipping Him, in many forms of Good,
That sate thereon; turning this patchwork world
Wholly to glorify Him, point His plan
Toward some supreme perfection, dimly visioned
By loving faith: not these to him, when, stressed
By some soul-dizzying woe beyond his trust,
He lifts his startled face, and finds the Throne
Empty, turns away, too drunk with Truth
To mind his shame, or feel the loss of God.

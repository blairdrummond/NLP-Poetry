When we stop where you lived, the house
 has thickened, the entry
 level to the wall with bricks, as though
 it could keep you out.
  
 Again the dream has fooled you into waking
 and we have walked out
 past ourselves, through the windows
 to be remembered in the light
 of closed rooms
 as a series of impositions
 across the arms of a chair, that woman’s face
 startled out of us so it lingers
 along a brick front.
  
 You are leading me back to the burned arcade
 where you said I stood with you
 in your childhood last night, your childhood
 which includes me now
 as surely as the look of that missing face
 between the rows of houses.
  
 We have gone so far into your past
 that nothing reflects us.
 No sun gleams from the glassless frame
 where a room burned,
 though the house stayed whole. There 
 is your school, your church, 
 the place you drank cider at lunch time.
 New rows of houses are going up.
 Children play quietly in a stairwell.
  
 Walking back, you tell the story
 of the sniper’s bullet
 making two clean holes in the taxi, how
 the driver ducked and drove on
 like nothing happened. No pain
 passed through you; it
 did not even stop the car
 or make you live more
 carefully. Near the check point we 
 stop talking, you let the hands
 rub your clothes
 against your body. You seem to be 
 there, all there.
  
 Watching, I am more apart
 for the sign of dismissal they will give me,
 thinking a woman would not conceal
 as I have, the perfect map
 of this return where I have met 
 and lost you willingly
 in a dead and living place.
  
 Now when you find me next in the dream,
 this boundary will move with us.
 We will both come back.

Tune yr sandwich to the key of C
 Make biscuits in kitchen B
  
 Miss Scarlet with her lead pipe
 Waits behind the cupboard door
  
 Clubs one from the other limp
 Only to begin again innocent
  
 & nothing to do but gather into
 Legion gather into constellation
  
 Coming along then a spider its web
 Holds the walls together holds the floor
  
 Up gathers toward a central point
 Mean & distribution derivation
  
 To insert a thumb & see what sticks
 Past the earth’s crust cirrus
  
 And acidic enough to spoon fork but
 Chew & eat & swallow digesting the fact
  
 That nine wonders hope the clouds have
 Answers hope the clouds have

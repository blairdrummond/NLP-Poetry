Isabella Whitney, The maner of her Wyll, 1573

 We’re told it was mostly the soul
               at stake, its formal
  
               setting-forth, as over water,
 where, against all odds,
  
 the words-on-paper make
               a sort of currency, which heaven,
  
               against all odds, accepts.
 So Will, which is to say, May what
  
 I purpose, please, this once, and what
               will happen coincide.
  
               To which the worldly
 dispositions were mere after-thought:
  
 your mother’s ring and so forth. What
               the law considered yours
  
               to give. Which in the case of 
 women was restricted—this was
  
 long ago, and elsewhere—so 
               that one confessedly “weak
  
               of purse” might all the more
 emphatically be thought of as having little
  
 to say. Except about the soul. The late
               disturbance in religion
  
               having done that much, the each
 for each responsible, even a servant,
  
 even the poor. Wild, then—quite        
               beyond the pale—to hustle
  
               the soul-part so hastily off
 the page. And turn, our Isabella Whitney,
  
 to the city and its faithlessness. Whose
               smells and sounds—the hawker’s cry,
  
               the drainage ditch in Smithfield—all
 the thick-laid, lovely, in-your-face-and-nostrils stuff
  
 of getting-by no woman of even the slightest
               affectation would profess to know,
  
               much less to know so well.
 As one would know the special places on
  
 his body, were the passion merely personal.

 Wattle and brickwork. Marble and mud.
               The city’s vast tautology. No city
  
               without people and no people but
 will long for what the city says they lack:
  
 high ceilings, gloves and laces, news,
               the hearth-lit circle of friendship, space
               
               for solitude, enough to eat.
 And something like a foothold in the whole-of-it,
  
 some without-which-not, some
               little but needful part in all the passing-
  
               from-hand-to-hand of it, so
 every time the bondsman racks his debtor or
  
 the shoemaker hammers a nail or one un-
               practiced girl imagines she
  
               has prompted a look of wistfulness,
 a piece of it is yours because
  
 your seeing it has made it that much slower
               to rejoin the blank
  
               oblivion of never-having-
 been. The year was fifteen hundred seventy-
  
 three. The year of our Redeemer, as
               they used to say. That other
  
               circuit of always-in-your-
 debt. From which she wrested, in her open
  
 I-am-writing-not-for-fun-but-for-the-money
               way of authorship, a world
  
               not just of plenty but—and here’s 
 the part of that’s legacy—of love.

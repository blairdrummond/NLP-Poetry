Ah Margarida,   
If I gave you my life,   
What would you do with it?   
       I’d take my earrings out of hock, 
       Marry a blind man,  
       And live on a tree-lined block. 
         
But Margarida,   
If I gave you my life,   
What would your mother say?   
       (Her mother knows me inside out.)   
       She’d say you’re a fool,  
       Without a doubt. 

And Margarida,   
If I gave you my life   
Literally, by dying?   
       I’d go to your funeral, firmly believing  
       You’d gone mad  
       To try to love by not living. 
         
But Margarida,   
If this giving of my life to you   
Were merely poetry?   
       In that case, forget it,  
       The deal’s off, 
       Because I don’t sell on credit.

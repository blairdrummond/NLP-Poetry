title : A Poem about Intelligence for My Brothers and Sisters

author : June Jordan

text : 
A few years back and they told me Black   
means a hole where other folks   
got brain/it was like the cells in the heads   
of Black children was out to every hour on the hour naps   
Scientists called the phenomenon the Notorious   
Jensen Lapse, remember?   
Anyway I was thinking   
about how to devise 
a test for the wise 
like a Stanford-Binet 
for the C.I.A. 
you know? 
Take Einstein 
being the most the unquestionable the outstanding 
the maximal mind of the century 
right? 
And I’m struggling against this lapse leftover 
from my Black childhood to fathom why 
anybody should say so: 
E=mc squared? 
I try that on this old lady live on my block: 
She sweeping away Saturday night from the stoop 
and mad as can be because some absolute 
jackass have left a kingsize mattress where 
she have to sweep around it stains and all she 
don’t want to know nothing about in the first place 
“Mrs. Johnson!” I say, leaning on the gate 
between us: “What you think about somebody come up 
with an E equals M C 2?” 
“How you doin,” she answer me, sideways, like she don’t 
want to let on she know I ain’ 
combed my hair yet and here it is 
Sunday morning but still I have the nerve 
to be bothering serious work with these crazy 
questions about 
“E equals what you say again, dear?” 
Then I tell her, “Well 
also this same guy? I think 
he was undisputed Father of the Atom Bomb!” 
“That right.” She mumbles or grumbles, not too politely 
“And dint remember to wear socks when he put on 
his shoes!” I add on (getting desperate) 
at which point Mrs. Johnson take herself and her broom 
a very big step down the stoop away from me 
“And never did nothing for nobody in particular 
lessen it was a committee 
and 
used to say, ‘What time is it?’ 
and 
you’d say, ‘Six o’clock.’ 
and 
he’d say, ‘Day or night?’ 
and 
and he never made nobody a cup a tea 
in his whole brilliant life! 
and 
[my voice rises slightly] 
and 
he dint never boogie neither: never!” 

“Well,” say Mrs. Johnson, “Well, honey, 
I do guess 
that’s genius for you.”

The nurse calls to tell me on Sunday evenings
 how he’s doing.
                                How he’s holding his own in front
 of the window with a thousand channels behind
 the one that saves his screen with snow, fish houses,
 and eagles.
                         How the days hang above the ice as vast
 recycled pages on which he writes in invisible ink.
 How the sun arcs across the sky, then breaks like a plate
 above the horizon.
                                     How the temperature drops
 below zero at dusk, then continues to fall till morning.
 In this way she teaches me how to speak to him in his sleep
 at his home in Minnesota, which is the same, she says,
 as talking to a friend you’ve never met, but grown close to
 nonetheless from hearing his voice.
                                                                    I hear the snow
 falling as she holds the phone outside the window.
 Silence is the sound of snow falling on snow, I think
 as I listen to the flakes inside the air before she closes
 the window.
                         “I’m thinking of walleye in their sleep,”
 I tell my father.
                               “Of catching them as they dream,
 then throwing them back in the hole I drilled by hand
 with the auger you gave me as a child, whose handle is stained
 with blood from my turning it so many times into the ice
 of Bad Medicine.”
                                     I wait for her voice to return, then say,
 “Just this for now since any more would disappear the lake
 inside his head on which he builds a house for us to fish
 throughout the winter.”

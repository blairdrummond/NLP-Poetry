Momentarily
  
                            the language of description is lost
  
         what you see with your eyes is enough, for you, anyway
  
 but how to get the sense of what you saw across
  
                                                                               to another person
  
 it’s possible
  
                       through the spirit in your voice
  
         when you say
  
                                          “it was great!”
  
 to convey
  
                             what happened
  
                                             in that moment
  
       & it was great
  
                                         not only that
  
                               it was terrific, & interesting too
                   
                                                                               it was nice
  
             & I had a good time doing it. I had fun.
  
 You should have been there. Not only that, it was beautiful.
 It was inspiring.

For a tree, you're the worst kind 
of friend, remembering everything.

page of pre-adolescence. The way 
the smallest knife-slice would darken 
with time, rise and widen. 

mark was here. Left his. 
But these are the digs you're used to, 
sufferer of mere presence, 
scratched years, scratched loves

and couldn't trust to an eardrum. 

(I scarred you myself long ago with 
my own jack-knife, jill-name.

unsteamed around me. Took us

new reminder, I was young, what could 

I have written? Didn't care then, had               
to see it scraped out, big letters beneath 
your erotic nubs and crotches. O beech, 
it's no big riddle: we fell in the forest, 
you heard. Quiet, in your own way. 
In your own way, spreading the word.

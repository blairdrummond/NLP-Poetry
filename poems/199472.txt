title : The Net

author : Babette Deutsch

text : 
Into this net of leaves, green as old glass   
That the sun fondles, trembling like images 

In water, this live net, swung overhead 
From branch to branch, what swam? The spider’s thread 

Is less passive, where it appears to float 
Like a bright hair clinging to the wind’s coat. 

Hot at work, history neither schemes nor grieves   
Here where the soaking dead are last year’s leaves, 

And over them slung, meshed with sun, a net   
No creature wove, none frantically tried to fret. 

The huge weight of time without its sting   
Hangs in that greenly cradling woof. A wing 

Has caught there, held. Held. But not to stay,   
We know, who, how slowly, walk away.

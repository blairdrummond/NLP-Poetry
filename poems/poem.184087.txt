They sing their dearest songs-- 
       He, she, all of them--yea, 
       Treble and tenor and bass, 
            And one to play; 
      With the candles mooning each face. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years O! 
How the sick leaves reel down in throngs! 

       They clear the creeping moss-- 
       Elders and juniors--aye, 
       Making the pathways neat 
            And the garden gay; 
       And they build a shady seat. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years, the years, 
See, the white storm-birds wing across. 

       They are blithely breakfasting all-- 
       Men and maidens--yea, 
       Under the summer tree, 
            With a glimpse of the bay, 
       While pet fowl come to the knee. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years O! 
And the rotten rose is ript from the wall. 

       They change to a high new house, 
       He, she, all of them--aye, 
       Clocks and carpets and chairs 
          On the lawn all day, 
       And brightest things that are theirs. . . . 
          Ah, no; the years, the years; 
Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs.

I. “If the Night Could Get Up & Walk”
  
         I cannot put my hand into
         a cabbage to turn 
         on the light, but
  
         the moon moves over
         the field of dark cabbage and an
         exchange fills 
         all veins.
  
         The cabbage is also a globe
         of light, the two globes
  
         now two eyes in 
         my saturated 
  
         head!
  
  
         II. “One Must Try Behind the Hills”
  
  
         Eight Great Dahlias stood
         beyond the Mountains.
  
         They set fire to the Sun
         in a black wood
         beyond the Mountains,
  
         in the Valley of Vision

        In the Valley of Vision
  
         the Fission of
         Flowers
  
         yields all Power
         in the Valley of Vision.
  
         Eight Suns
         on Eight Stems,
  
         aflame!

title : Golden Age

author : Timothy Steele

text : 
Even in fortunate times,
The nectar is spiked with woe. 
Gods are incorrigibly
Capricious, and the needy
Beg in Nineveh or sleep
In paper-gusting plazas
Of the New World’s shopping malls.

Meantime, the tyrant battens 
On conquest, while advisers, 
Angling for preferment, seek 
Expedient paths. Heartbroken, 
The faithful advocate looks 
Back on cities of the plain 
And trudges into exile.

And if any era thrives,
It’s only because, somewhere,
In a plane tree’s shade, friends sketch 
The dust with theorems and proofs,
Or because, instinctively,
A man puts his arm around 
The shoulder of grief and walks 
It (for an hour or an age) 
Through all its tears and telling.

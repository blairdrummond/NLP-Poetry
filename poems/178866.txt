title : Kneeling

author : R. S. Thomas

text : 
Moments of great calm, 
Kneeling before an altar 
Of wood in a stone church 
In summer, waiting for the God   
To speak; the air a staircase   
For silence; the sun’s light   
Ringing me, as though I acted   
A great rôle. And the audiences   
Still; all that close throng 
Of spirits waiting, as I, 
For the message. 
                         Prompt me, God; 
But not yet. When I speak,   
Though it be you who speak   
Through me, something is lost.   
The meaning is in the waiting.

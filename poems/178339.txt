text : 
I have not used my darkness well, 
nor the Baroque arm that hangs from my shoulder,   
nor the Baroque arm of my chair.   
The rain moves out in a dark schedule.   
Let the wind marry. I know the creation   
continues through love. The rain’s a wife.   
I cannot sleep or lie awake. Looking   
at the dead I turn back, fling 
my hat into their grandstands for relief.   
How goes a life? Something like the ocean   
building dead coral.

title : Signs

text : 
All night I dreamed of my home,   
of the roads that are so long 
and straight they die in the middle— 
among the spines of elderly weeds   
on either side, among the dead cats,   
the ants who are all eyes, the suitcase   
thrown open, sprouting failures. 

   2. 
And this evening in the garden   
I find the winter 
inside a snail shell, rigid and   
cool, a little stubborn temple,   
its one visitor gone. 

   3. 
If there were messages or signs, 
I might hear now a voice tell me   
to walk forever, to ask 
the mold for pardon, and one 
by one I would hear out my sins, 
hear they are not important—that I am   
part of this rain 
drumming its long fingers, and   
of the roadside stone refusing   
to blink, and of the coyote 
nailed to the fence with its 
long grin. 

And when there are no messages   
the dead lie still— 
their hands crossed so strangely   
like knives and forks after supper. 

   4. 
I stay up late listening. 
My feet tap the floor, 
they begin a tiny dance 
which will outlive me. 
They turn away from this poem.   
It is almost Spring.

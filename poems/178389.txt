I 

In the cubbyhole entrance to Cornell and Son,   
a woman in a turquoise sweater 
curls up to sleep. Her right arm seeks 
a cold spot in the stone to release its worry   
and her legs stretch 
against the middle hinge. 

I want to ask her in for coffee, 
to tell her go sleep in the extra bed upstairs,   
but I’m a guest, 
unaccustomed to this place 
where homeless people drift along the square   
bordering Benjamin Franklin Parkway. 

From her portrait on the mantel, 
Lucretia Mott asks when 
will Americans see 
how all forms of oppression blight 
the possibilities of a people. 
The passion for preserving Independence Square 

should reach this nameless woman, settling   
in the heavy heat of August, 
exposed to the glare of every passerby. 
What makes property so private? A fence? 
No trespassing signs? Militia ready to die for it   
and taxes? Lights in the middle storeys 

of office buildings blaze all night above me.   
Newspapers don’t explain how wealth   
is bound to these broken people. 
North of here, things get really rough.   
Longshoremen out of work bet on eddies   
in the Schuylkill River. 

Factories collapse to weed 
and ruptured dream. Years ago, Longhouse sachems   
rode canoes to Philadelphia, 
entering these red brick halls. 
They explained how 
the law that kept them unified 

required a way to share the wealth.   
Inside the hearths of these same halls,   
such knowledge was obscured, 
and plans were laid to push all Indians , 
west. This city born of brotherly love   
still turns around this conflict. 

Deeper in the dusk, 
William Penn must weep 
from his perch on top of City Hall. 
Our leaders left this woman in the lurch.   
How can there be democracy 
without the means to live?

Every fifteen minutes 
a patrol car cruises by. I jolt awake   
at four a.m. to sirens screeching 
and choppers lugging to the hospital heliport 
someone who wants to breathe. 
The sultry heat leads me 
to the window. What matters? This small   
square of night sky and two trees 
bound by a wide brick wall. 
All around, skyscrapers 

are telling their stories 
under dwindling stars. The girders 
remember where Mohawk ironworkers stayed   
that day they sat after work 
on a balcony, drinking beer. 

Below them, a film crew caught 
some commercials. In another room above   
a mattress caught fire and someone flung it   
down into the frame. A woman in blue   
sashayed up the street 

while a flaming mattress, 
falling at the same speed as a flower,   
bloomed over her left shoulder. 
Every fifteen minutes 
a patrol car cruises by. The men inside 

mean business. They understood the scene.   
A mattress burning in the street 
and business deadlocked. Mohawks 
drinking beer above it all. 
They radioed insurrection, 

drew their guns, then three-stepped 
up the stairs. Film crews caught the scene,   
but it never played. The Mohawks 
didn’t guess a swat team had moved in.   
When policemen blasted off their door, 

the terrified men shoved a table 
against the splintered frame. 
They fought it out. 
One whose name meant Deer got shot   
again and again. They let him lie 

before they dragged him by his heels   
down four flights of stairs. At every step,   
he hurdled above his pain 
until one final leap 
gained him the stars. 

The news reported one cop broke his leg.   
The film’s been banished to a vault. There are   
no plaques. But girders whisper at night 
in Philadelphia. They know the boarding house,   
but will not say. They know as well what lasts 
      and what falls down.

Passing Doric colonnades of banks 
and walls of dark glass, 
passing press-the-button-visitors-please 
Liberty Townhouses, I turned 
up Broad Street near the Hershey Hotel 
and headed toward the doorman 
outside the Bellevue. Palms and chandeliers inside. 
A woman in mauve silk and pearls stepped into the street. 

I was tracking my Mohawk grandmother   
through time. She left a trace 
of her belief somewhere near Locust and Thirteenth.   
I didn’t see you, tall, dark, intense, 

with three bouquets of flowers in your hand. 
On Walnut and Broad, between the Union League   
and the Indian Campsite, you stopped me,   
shoving flowers toward my arm. 

“At least, I’m not begging,” you cried. 
The desperation in your voice 
spiraled through my feet while I fumbled the few bucks   
you asked for. I wanted those flowers— 

iris, ageratum, goldenrod and lilies— 
because in desperation 
you thought of beauty. I recognized 
the truth and human love you acted on, 

your despair echoing my own. 
Forgive me. I should have bought more   
of those Philadelphia flowers, passed hand 
to hand so quickly, I was stunned a block away. 

You had to keep your pride, as I have done,   
selling these bouquets of poems 
to anyone who’ll take them. After our exchange,   
grandmother’s tracks grew clearer. 

I returned for days, but you were never there.   
If you see her — small, dark, intense, 
with a bun of black hair and the gaze of an orphan,   
leave a petal in my path. 
Then I’ll know I can go on.

Some days you get angry enough   
to question. There’s a plan out east 
with a multitude of charts and diagrams. 

They planned to take the timber, the good soil.   
Even now, they demolish mountains.   
Next they’ll want the water and the air. 

I tell you they’re planning to leave our reservations   
bare of life. They plan to dump their toxic   
wastes on our grandchildren. No one wants to say 

how hard they’ve worked a hundred years.   
What of you, learning how this continent’s 
getting angry? Do you consider what’s in store for you?

title : The Imagined Copperhead

author : Andrew Hudgins

text : 
Without intending to hide, 
the imagined copperhead 
hid on the path ahead, 
unseen on bronze leaves, unheard, 
and a mortal likelihood   
at every step. This was childhood, 
mine, the wood’s jihad    
against a boy who’d 
intruded among monkshood, 
wasp, tick, and nettles haired 
with needles. Scrub brush abhorred 
him with a horde 
of  welts, bites, and stings, but he’d 
never seen a copperhead, 
though he’d looked hard 
taking, as he’d been ordered, heed. 
The snake wasn’t a falsehood, 
though, to him. Dread 
was his nature, and he hared 
through sunlight and shade, head 
swiveling for the copperhead 
he’d begun to covet, the ballyhooed 
killer a camouflaged godhead 
on which his inborn faith cohered, 
and his priesthood.

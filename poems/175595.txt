title : Such Is the Sickness of Many a Good Thing

author : Robert Duncan

text : 
Was he then Adam of the Burning Way? 
hid away in the heat like wrath 
      conceald in Love’s face, 
or the seed, Eris in Eros,   
      key and lock 
of what I was?      I could not speak 
      the releasing 
word.      For into a dark   
      matter he came 
and askt me to say what 
      I could not say.      “I ..” 

All the flame in me stopt 
      against my tongue. 
My heart was a stone, a dumb 
      unmanageable thing in me, 
a darkness that stood athwart   
      his need 
for the enlightening, the 
      “I love you” that has   
only this one quick in time, 
      this one start 
when its moment is true. 

Such is the sickness of many a good thing   
that now into my life from long ago this   
refusing to say I love you has bound   
the weeping, the yielding, the 
      yearning to be taken again, 
into a knot, a waiting, a string 

so taut it taunts the song, 
it resists the touch. It grows dark   
to draw down the lover’s hand   
from its lightness to what’s 
      underground.

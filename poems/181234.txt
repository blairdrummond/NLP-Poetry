The show did not start off 
auspiciously, the contestants 
were nervous and kept fiddling 
with the wires attached 
to their privates, the men 
being especially anxious 
over the question of balls. 
The women were more querulous. 

The first question, a medical subject, 
was why had the anti-abortionists 
not mentioned, let alone commented on, 
the Baboon Heart transplant? 
One terrified contestant guessed 
it was because the moral majority’s 
nervous concern with evolution 
precluded their bringing it up. 
That hopeful contestant’s face 
reflected the malicious light 
in the eyes of the host who 
immediately threw the switch 

A powerful surge shot through 
the wires and both sexes screamed 
and writhed, to the delight of 
the vast viewership, estimated 
at 100 million, all of whom, 
presumably, were delighted 
not to be on the show, 
because not one in a million 
knew the answer.

title : The Last Attack. To Klaus

author : Zbigniew Herbert

text : 
Permit me to open by expressing joy and wonder 
that we're marching at the head of our companies 
in different uniforms under a different command 
but with a single aim—to survive 

You say to me—look here we should probably let 
these boys go home to their Margot to their Kasia 
war is beautiful only in parades 
but apart from that as we know—mud and blood 
and rats 

As you speak comes an avalanche of artillery fire 
it's that bastard Parkinson who is taking so long 
he caught up with us at last when we took a walk 
on an irregular route our collars loose at the chin 
our hands in our pockets we were on leave already 
when Parkinson suddenly reminded us that it was 
not the end yet that this blasted war isn't over yet

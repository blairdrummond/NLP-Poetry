text : 
Down in the blue-green water   
       at nightfall some selving shapes   
float fluorescing, trance-dancing,   
       trembling to the rhythm of   
theodoxical marching-   
       music that they hear over   
the mere noise of the breaking   
       tide. Above, stars in certain   
places; along the shore roads,   
       cars carrying people on   
uncertain errands, sordid   
       and sacred and all the kinds   
in between. Halogen-lit,   
       a woman gets down from her   
all-wheel-drive velocipede,   
       enters through an obeying   
door a cyclopean store   
       to buy unintelligent   
fresh fish and other objects   
       whether formerly alive   
or formerly dead, she comes   
       out again, a poor man calls   
to her, selling his no-news-   
       paper; the disastrous head-   
lines smile and nod, they announce   
       the plans of steel patriots   
and undertakers, ad-men   
       and fallen vice-generals,   
doping their stolen crusades.   
       But the woman has learned, as   
I have learned, as all of us   
       must keep learning if we are   
to be good subjects, how to   
       make of a newspaper the   
mask of a locust, calmly   
       put it on, and begin once   
more to eat everything up.

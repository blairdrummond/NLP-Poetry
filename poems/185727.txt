title : Bowl

text : 
Turn it over and look up 
into the sphere of heaven.   
The tracery is lucent,   
light seeping through to write,   
white-ink your face, upturned.   

Swing it below 
and it's a cradle of blue water,   
the sea, a womb. 
A mixing bowl   
for Babylonian gods. 
Here, they whirl up the cosmos.   

Pick it up and your hands 
form a pedestal, 
and all who drink 
contain the arcs 
of body and the universe— 
and between them,   

no imaginable tear or distance.

Jamaica, 1960
Ignoring the local reliquiae— 
neoclassical arches in ruin, 
courtyards, their fountains toppled, 

prados flourishing in prickle-weed, esplanades 
no longer level enough to collect rainwater, 
much less respect for the Imperio de España  

tarnished by an islander’s mock-British accent— 
two fisherman returned at sundown. 
Antiquaries themselves, these fishermen 

schooled in the currents, the tide, 
the tunneled limestone of the coral reefs, 
preferred the graceful curves of the £. 

At the landing, five children, single file, 
marched away the birds like soldiers, 
the learned lyrics escaping their lips: 

Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.

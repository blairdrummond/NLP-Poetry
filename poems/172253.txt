title : Ocean City: Early March

author : Elizabeth Spires

text : 
Along Ocean Highway, apartments rise up
to ten and twenty stories,
white, hallucinatory, defying the shifting sand, 
the storm moving in off the Atlantic
that drives the rain, needlelike,
across the windshield so that we can’t see,
so that we stop in Ocean City to wait the storm out 
at the Dutch, the only bar on the boardwalk
open this time of year, all the concessions
boarded up, weather-beaten, closed against the season.

Last summer in violet light, kites 
spiraled downward in loops, then up,
dragons and birds flying high above the boardwalk. 
Ocean City. Haven of the lost and aimless, 
with a ten-foot sand sculpture of Christ 
illuminated by neon lights.
People on their way to Ripley’s BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
looked on in apathy, then wandered off, 
their children begging for another ride 
on the Avalanche or Safari.
Out, far out, at the end of a pier,
silhouetted against gray sky, gray water, 
Morbid Manor rose up, Gothic and dreamy, 
as children ran screaming from the exit door 
chased by a ghost with a chain saw.
One child ignored it all; she lay with her face 
pressed close to a knothole in the pier,
looking down, down, to the boiling black water.
“What do you see?” I asked,
but she didn’t move or answer me.

Long, narrow, and dark,
the Dutch, with its shifting clientele
from summer weekend pickups to Ocean City regulars
allows for strangers. We order Irish coffee,
then two more, and use our change to play an arcade game. 
Aliens, half an inch high, in green armor,
drop out of a glowing sky and quickly multiply.
Our backs to the storm, we play out
old anxieties, losing each game to time and starting over: 
we must save what’s being threatened and not ask why.

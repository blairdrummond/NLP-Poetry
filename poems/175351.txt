title : In Cities, Be Alert

author : Annie Finch

text : 
You may hear that your heartbeat is uneven 
and let new tension climb around your shoulders, 
thinking you've found the trick for going mad. 
But try to keep a grip on where you are. 

Remember: all around you is pure city; 
try to stay alert. On the wide streets, 
so empty late at night, streaking in glass, 
the color of an alley, or the fall 

of a sideways flicker from a neon sign 
may utterly and briefly disconcert youâ€” 
but as you go, you'll find that noise is worse. 
Prepare for noise. But never scream. Even tensing 

ears too far in advance can sharpen sirens, 
and as for horns. ... When you're back to 
your normal rhythm after such encounters, 

just try to stay alert. You'll never know 
exactly who is coming up behind you, 
but the sudden movement of pedestrians 
will finally, of course, be what disarms you.

title : The Termites

author : Douglas Florian

text : 
Our 
high and 
mighty 
termite 
mound 
arises 
far above 
the ground, 
and just as 
deep, grows 
underground. 
Our nest is 
blessed to be 
immense.   It gives 
us all a firm 
defense, superior 
to any fence.   It 
shields us from our 
enemies.   It keeps us 
cooler, by degrees. 
From floods and droughts 
it guarantees.   A prize 
nobody will assign in 
architectural design, but 
still our hill suits us just fine.

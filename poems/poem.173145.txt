Rhymed Stanza

What is Hope? A smiling rainbow 
      Children follow through the wet; 
'Tis not here, still yonder, yonder: 
      Never urchin found it yet. 

What is Life? A thawing iceboard 
      On a sea with sunny shore;-- 
Gay we sail; it melts beneath us; 
      We are sunk, and seen no more. 

What is Man? A foolish baby, 
      Vainly strives, and fights, and frets; 
Demanding all, deserving nothing;-- 
      One small grave is what he gets.

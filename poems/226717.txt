title : An Orange in Mérida

author : Ben Belitt

text : 
The orange-peelers of Mérida, in the wrought- 
iron midday, come with mechanical skewers 
and live oranges, to straddle the paths 
on caissons of bicycle wheels 
and work in the dark of the plaza, like jewelers’ cloths. 

The orange is ceremonious. Its sleep 
is Egyptian. Its golden umbilicus 
waits in pyramidal light, swath over swath, outwitting   
the Caesars. It cannot be ravaged by knives, 
but clasps its mortality in, like the skein of an asp. 

The bandstand glitters like bone, in laurel 
and spittle. Behind their triangular 
catafalques, the orange-peelers move through the thirst   
of the world with Rameses’ bounty 
caulked into the hive of the peel 

while ratchets and wheels spin a blazing   
cosmology on their little machines. Under   
skewers and handles, the orange’s skin 
is pierced, the orange, in chain-mail and papyrus, 
unwinds the graveclothes of Pharaoh 

in a helix of ribbon, unflawed, from the navel’s 
knot to the rind and the pulp underneath, like a butterfly’s   
chrysalis. And sleeper by sleeper, the living turn with their thirst   
to each other, the orange’s pith is broken 
in a blind effervescence that perfumes the palate and burns 

to the tooth’s bite. 
                                  And the dead reawaken.

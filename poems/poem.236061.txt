Poems for Weddings



Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs 
As on it glided through the trees 
Still following ever the liko 
The Ahihi lehua of the vale. 

      Chorus: 
      Farewell to thee, farewell to thee 
      Thou charming one who dwells in shaded bowers 
      One fond embrace ere I depart 
      Until we meet again. 

Thus sweet memories come back to me 
Bringing fresh remembrance of the past 
Dearest one, yes, thou art mine own 
From thee, true love shall ne'er depart. 

I have seen and watched thy loveliness, 
Thou sweet Rose of Maunawili
And 'tis there the birds oft love to dwell 
And sip the honey from thy lips.

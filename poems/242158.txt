Honor a going thing, goldfinch, corporation, tree,
           morality: any working order,
        animate or inanimate: it
  
 has managed directed balance,
           the incoming and outgoing energies are working right,
        some energy left to the mechanism,
  
 some ash, enough energy held
           to maintain the order in repair,
        assure further consumption of entropy,
  
 expending energy to strengthen order:
           honor the persisting reactor,
        the container of change, the moderator: the yellow
  
 bird flashes black wing-bars
           in the new-leaving wild cherry bushes by the bay,
        startles the hawk with beauty,
  
 flitting to a branch where
           flash vanishes into stillness,
        hawk addled by the sudden loss of sight:
  
 honor the chemistries, platelets, hemoglobin kinetics,
           the light-sensitive iris, the enzymic intricacies
        of control,
  
 the gastric transformations, seed
           dissolved to acrid liquors, synthesized into
        chirp, vitreous humor, knowledge,
  
 blood compulsion, instinct: honor the
           unique genes,
        molecules that reproduce themselves, divide into
  
 sets, the nucleic grain transmitted
           in slow change through ages of rising and falling form,
        some cells set aside for the special work, mind
  
 or perception rising into orders of courtship,
           territorial rights, mind rising
        from the physical chemistries
  
 to guarantee that genes will be exchanged, male
           and female met, the satisfactions cloaking a deeper
        racial satisfaction:
  
 heat kept by a feathered skin:
           the living alembic, body heat maintained (bunsen
        burner under the flask)
  
 so the chemistries can proceed, reaction rates
           interdependent, self-adjusting, with optimum
        efficiency—the vessel firm, the flame
  
 staying: isolated, contained reactions! the precise and
           necessary worked out of random, reproducible,
        the handiwork redeemed from chance, while the
  
 goldfinch, unconscious of the billion operations
           that stay its form, flashes, chirping (not a
        great songster) in the bay cherry bushes wild of leaf. ﻿

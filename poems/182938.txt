title : Winter Journal: Gray Shadings

author : Emily Wilson

text : 
Barely discerned clouds 
Hard, hard to get here 
what worth, what worth 
River of steel. 
River of no one becoming you. 
Trees that are emptier today, more forced in their forms 
To focus on them is to be made glad of them in their 
       strangeness 
The earth extrudes through them toward emptiness 
The few elms dismembering 
The willow’s bloom above shore like a curtaining 
To focus on it is to be mostly taken into its tapes 
       and its filters 
It is lost to the surface of this river 
The dull, impenetrable, intractable surface 
resisting, unetchable 
Now the faint rain. 
I don’t know what to do with all this waiting 
things getting themselves readied toward emptiness 
The scratchy, shattering elm, its crimped skin, its 
       exfoliating, its rivening 
       its being disfigured by fortune 
       and by wind 
A crone with old frills at her hair 
The grasp of her toward me

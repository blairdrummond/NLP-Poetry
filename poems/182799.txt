Spring wafts up the smell of bus exhaust, of bread   
and fried potatoes, tips green on the branches, 
repeats old news: arrogance, ignorance, war. 
A cinder-block wall shared by two houses 
is new rubble. On one side was a kitchen 
sink and a cupboard, on the other was 
a bed, a bookshelf, three framed photographs. 

Glass is shattered across the photographs; 
two half-circles of hardened pocket bread 
sit on the cupboard. There provisionally was 
shelter, a plastic truck under the branches 
of a fig tree. A knife flashed in the kitchen, 
merely dicing garlic. Engines of war 
move inexorably toward certain houses 

while citizens sit safe in other houses 
reading the newspaper, whose photographs 
make sanitized excuses for the war. 
There are innumerable kinds of bread 
brought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen: 
the date, the latitude, tell which one was 
dropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches. 

The uncontrolled and multifurcate branches 
of possibility infiltrate houses’ 
walls, windowframes, ceilings. Where there was 
a tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph 
on a distant computer screen. Elsewhere, a kitchen 
table’s setting gapes, where children bred 
to branch into new lives were culled for war. 

Who wore this starched smocked cotton dress? Who wore 
this jersey blazoned for the local branch 
of the district soccer team? Who left this black bread 
and this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses? 
Whose father begged for mercy in the kitchen? 
Whose memory will frame the photograph 
and use the memory for what it was 

never meant for by this girl, that old man, who was 
caught on a ball field, near a window: war, 
exhorted through the grief a photograph 
revives. (Or was the team a covert branch 
of a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen, 
a bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?) 
What did the old men pray for in their houses 

of prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses 
between blackouts and blasts, when each word was 
flensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread, 
both hostage to the happenstance of war? 
Sometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen. 
Outside the window, black strokes on a graph 
of broken glass, birds line up on bare branches. 

“This letter curves, this one spreads its branches 
like friends holding hands outside their houses.” 
Was the lesson stopped by gunfire? Was 
there panic, silence? Does a torn photograph 
still gather children in the teacher’s kitchen? 
Are they there meticulously learning war- 
time lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?

title : End of Market Day

author : Judith Harris

text : 
At five, the market is closing. 
Burdock roots, parsley, and rutabagas 
are poured back into the trucks. 
The antique dealer breaks down his tables. 

Light dappled, in winter parkas 
shoppers hunt for bargains: 
a teapot, or costume jewelry, 
a grab bag of rubbishy vegetables for stew. 

Now twilight, the farmerâ€™s wife 
bundled in her tweed coat and pocket apron 
counts out her cash from a metal box, 
and nods to her grown-up son 

back from a tour in Iraq, 
as he waits in the station wagon 
with the country music turned way up, 
his prosthetic leg gunning the engine.

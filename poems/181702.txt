text : 
Big Jack and his walking stick 
live on the ridge. Navajo 
orphan kids dance for him, 
bobcat urine’s in the weeds, 
the shotgun barrel's up his sleeve,   
a Persian coin is on the wind.   
The Chinese Mountains smell the moon 
and arch their backs. I tell him, Jack, 
there’s times I wish I was living in 
canvas France, the old west, 
a picture book, the Sea of 
Tranquility, or even in   
the den near the hot spring. 
He says, kid, to hell with 

phantom limbs; spring is a verb, 
a wish is a wash, a walking stick   
is a gottdam wing.

title : The Tea and Sage Poem

author : Fady Joudah

text : 
At a desk made of glass,
 In a glass walled-room
 With red airport carpet,
  
 An officer asked
 My father for fingerprints,
 And my father refused,
  
 So another offered him tea
 And he sipped it. The teacup
 Template for fingerprints.
  
 My father says, it was just
 Hot water with a bag.
 My father says, in his country,
  
 Because the earth knows
 The scent of history,
 It gave the people sage.
  
 I like my tea with sage
 From my mother’﻿s garden,
 Next to the snapdragons
  
 She calls fishmouths
 Coming out for air. A remedy
 For stomach pains she keeps
  
 In the kitchen where 
 She always sings.
 First, she is Hagar
  
 Boiling water
 Where tea is loosened.
 Then she drops
  
 In it a pinch of sage
 And lets it sit a while.
 She tells a story:
  
 The groom arrives late
 To his wedding
 Wearing only one shoe.
  
 The bride asks him
 About the shoe. He tells her
 He lost it while jumping
  
 Over a house-wall.
 Breaking away from soldiers.
 She asks:
  
 Tea with sage
 Or tea with mint?
  
 With sage, he says,
 Sweet scent, bitter tongue.
 She makes it, he drinks.

“I order you to operate, I was not made to suffer.”
 Probing for old wills, and friendships, for to free
 to New York City, to be in History, New York City being
 History at that time.” “And I traded my nights
 for Intensity; & I barter my right to Gold; & I’d traded
 my eyes much earlier, when I was circa say seven years old
 for ears to hear Who was speaking, & just exactly who
 was being told….” & I’m glad
                   I hear your words so clearly
                   & I would not have done it
                                 differently
                   & I’m amused at such simplicity, even so,
 inside each & every door. And now I’m with you, instantly,
 & I’ll see you tomorrow night, and I see you constantly, hopefully
 though one or the other of us is often, to the body-mind’s own self
 more or less out of sight! Taking walks down any streets, High
 Street, Main Street, walk past my doors! Newtown; Nymph Rd
             (on the Mesa); Waveland
 Meeting House Lane, in old Southampton; or BelleVue Road
             in England, etcetera
 Other roads; Manhattan; see them there where open or shut up behind
             “I’ve traded sweet lines for answers …”
 They don’t serve me anymore.” They still serve me on the floor.
             Or,
 as now, as floor. Now we look out the windows, go in &
             out the doors. The Door.
 (That front door which was but & then at that time My door).
             I closed it
 On the wooing of Helen. “And so we left schools for her.” For
 She is not one bit fiction; & she is easy to see;
             & she leaves me small room
 For contradiction. And she is not alone; & she is not one bit
             lonely in the large high room, &
 invention is just vanity, which is plain. She
 is the heart’s own body, the body’s own mind in itself
             self-contained.
 & she talks like you; & she has created truly not single-handedly
 Our tragic thing, America. And though I would be I am not afraid
             of her, & you also not. You, yourself, I,
 Me, myself, me. And no, we certainly have not pulled down
             our vanity: but
 We wear it lightly here,
                                        here where I traded evenly,
                                                                                     & even gladly
 health, for sanity; here
                                     where we live day-by-day
                                                                              on the same spot.
 My English friends, whom I love & miss, we talk to ourselves here,
             & we two
 rarely fail to remember, although we write seldom, & so must seem
             gone forever.
 In the stained sky over this morning the clouds seem about to burst
             What is being remembering
 Is how we are, together. Like you we are always bothered, except
             by the worst; & we are living
             as with you we also were
 fired, only, mostly, by changes in the weather. For Oh dear hearts,
 When precious baby blows her fuse / it’s just our way
             of keeping amused.
 That we offer of & as excuse. Here’s to you. All the very best.
             What’s your pleasure? Cheers.

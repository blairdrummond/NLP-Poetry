title : The Lodger

text : 
You could figure it as a trapdoor, 
blur of hinge and 
                         down 
into the unconscious of this stranger 
moving around your garden like a trap— 
making all the greens unstable 
as the warble of nausea come bang up to greet you. 
Bang to rights 
is how he'd like to have your house. Cuckoo, 
wool-wearing garden-dweller, 
new-age Salvationist, holy among your cow-parsley 
and roses. 
               Meanwhile, the unaccustomed heat. 
Meanwhile, a sky tunnelling upward— 
sense of proportion—golden section   
of elder hedge; then the disgraceful paddock gone wild.

title : In a U-Haul North of Damascus

Lord, what are the sins 
I have tried to leave behind me? The bad checks, 
the workless days, the scotch bottles thrown across the fence   
and into the woods, the cruelty of silence, 
the cruelty of lies, the jealousy, 
the indifference? 

What are these on the scale of sin   
or failure 
that they should follow me through the streets of Columbus,   
the moon-streaked fields between Benevolence 
and Cuthbert where dwarfed cotton sparkles like pearls 
on the shoulders of the road. What are these 
that they should find me half-lost,   
sick and sleepless 
behind the wheel of this U-Haul truck parked in a field 
            on Georgia 45 
a few miles north of Damascus, 
some makeshift rest stop for eighteen wheelers 
where the long white arms of oaks slap across trailers 
and headlights glare all night through a wall of pines?

What was I thinking, Lord? 
That for once I'd be in the driver's seat, a firm grip   
on direction? 

So the jon boat muscled up the ramp, 
the Johnson outboard, the bent frame of the wrecked Harley   
chained for so long to the back fence,   
the scarred desk, the bookcases and books,   
the mattress and box springs, 
a broken turntable, a Pioneer amp, a pair 
of three-way speakers, everything mine 
I intended to keep. Everything else abandon. 

But on the road from one state 
to another, what is left behind nags back through the distance,   
a last word rising to a scream, a salad bowl 
shattering against a kitchen cabinet, china barbs 
spiking my heel, blood trailed across the cream linoleum   
like the bedsheet that morning long ago 
just before I watched the future miscarried. 

Jesus, could the irony be 
that suffering forms a stronger bond than love?

Now the sun 
streaks the windshield with yellow and orange, heavy beads   
of light drawing highways in the dew-cover. 
I roll down the window and breathe the pine-air, 
the after-scent of rain, and the far-off smell 
of asphalt and diesel fumes. 

But mostly pine and rain 
as though the world really could be clean again. 

Somewhere behind me, 
miles behind me on a two-lane that streaks across   
west Georgia, light is falling 
through the windows of my half-empty house. 
Lord, why am I thinking about this? And why should I care   
so long after everything has fallen 
to pain that the woman sleeping there should be sleeping alone?   
Could I be just another sinner who needs to be blinded   
before he can see? Lord, is it possible to fall   
toward grace? Could I be moved 
to believe in new beginnings? Could I be moved?

text : 
You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
 but I have lived two decades longer now than you
 and all this time I have carried you in my head
 
so I think I have the right to question what you said,
 dear teacher. My religious upbringing’s residue,
 you would have thought it foolish. To speak to the dead,
 
however, is sometimes necessary, especially haunted
 by all the things I know you hoped I’d do
 with all this time that I have carried you in my head.
 
In a dream last night I followed where you led
 until you asked me in a loud voice what I knew.
 (You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
 
but I was dreaming and could not refuse.) I said
 that you were wrong, that I could see your bitter view
 (since all this time I have carried you in my head)
  
 for what it was, and you for who you were. Instead
 of dreaming your reply I woke as you withdrew.
 You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead
 but all this time I have carried you in my head.

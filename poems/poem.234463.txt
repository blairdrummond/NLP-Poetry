Love, First Love, Heartache & Loss



And ye shall walk in silk attire,
    And siller hae to spare,
Gin ye'll consent to be his bride,
      Nor think o' Donald mair.
O wha wad buy a silken goun
      Wi' a poor broken heart!
Or what's to me a siller croun,
      Gin frae my love I part!

The mind wha's every wish is pure
      Far dearer is to me;
And ere I'm forc'd to break my faith,
      I'll lay me down an' dee!
For I hae pledg'd my virgin troth
      Brave Donald's fate to share;
And he has gi'en to me his heart,
      Wi' a' its virtues rare.

His gentle manners wan my heart,
      He gratefu' took the gift;
Could I but think to seek it back,
      It wad be waur than theft!
For langest life can ne'er repay
      The love he bears to me;
And ere I'm forc'd to break my troth,
      I'll lay me doun an' dee.

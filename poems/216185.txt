title : Home Movies:  A Sort of Ode

Because it hadn't seemed enough, 
after a while, to catalogue 
more Christmases, the three-layer cakes 
ablaze with birthday candles, the blizzard 
Billy took a shovel to, 
Phil's lawnmower tour of the yard, 
the tree forts, the shoot-'em-ups 
between the boys in new string ties 
and cowboy hats and holsters, 
or Mother sticking a bow as big 
as Mouseketeer ears in my hair, 

my father sometimes turned the gaze 
of his camera to subjects more 
artistic or universal: 
long closeups of a rose's face; 
a real-time sunset (nearly an hour); 
what surely were some brilliant autumn 
leaves before their colors faded 
to dry beige on the aging film; 
a great deal of pacing, at the zoo, 
by polar bears and tigers caged, 
he seemed to say, like him. 

What happened between him and her 
is another story. And just as well 
we have no movie of it, only 
some unforgiving scowls she gave 
through terrifying, ticking silence 
when he must have asked her (no 
sound track) for a smile. 
Still, what I keep yearning for 
isn't those generic cherry 
blossoms at their peak, or the brave 
daffodil after a snowfall, 

it's the re-run surprise 
of the unshuttered, prefab blanks 
of windows at the back of the house, 
and how the lines of aluminum 
siding are scribbled on with meaning 
only for us who lived there; 
it's the pair of elephant bookends 
I'd forgotten, with the upraised trunks 
like handles, and the books they meant 
to carry in one block to a future 
that scattered all of us. 

And look: it's the stoneware mixing bowl 
figured with hand-holding dancers 
handed down so many years 
ago to my own kitchen, still 
valueless, unbroken. Here 
she's happy, teaching us to dye 
the Easter eggs in it, a Grecian 
urn of sorts near which—a foster 
child of silence and slow time 
myself—I smile because she does 
and patiently await my turn.

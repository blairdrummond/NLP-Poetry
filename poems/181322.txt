title : What is it to be human?

author : Waldo Williams

text : 
What is staying alive? To possess   
A great hall inside of a cell. 
What is it to know? The same root 
Underneath the branches. 

What is it to believe? Being a carer   
Until relief takes over. 
And to forgive? On fours through thorns 
To keep company to an old enemy. 

What is it to sing? To receive breath 
From the genius of creation. 
What's work but humming a song 
From wood and wheat. 

What are state affairs? A craft 
That's still only crawling? 
And armaments? Thrust a knife 
In a baby's fist. 

Being a nation? What can it be? A gift 
In the swell of the heart. 
And to love a country? Keeping house 
In a cloud of witnesses. 

What's the world to the all powerful? 
A circle spinning. 
And to the children of the earth? 
A cradle rocking.

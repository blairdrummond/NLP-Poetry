title : A Girl

author : Michael Field

text : 
A Girl,
      Her soul a deep-wave pearl
 Dim, lucent of all lovely mysteries;
      A face flowered for heart’s ease,
      A brow’s grace soft as seas
      Seen through faint forest-trees:
      A mouth, the lips apart,
 Like aspen-leaflets trembling in the breeze
     From her tempestuous heart.
     Such: and our souls so knit,
     I leave a page half-writ —
            The work begun
 Will be to heaven’s conception done,
            If she come to it.

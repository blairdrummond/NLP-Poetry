I don’t like doing homework, 
I know that it will bore me. 
But now I am much happier 
’Cause Freddie does it for me! 

He greets me at the door each day 
When I come home from school. 
He just can’t wait to read my books— 
I think that’s pretty cool! 

I give him all my homework, 
Like history and math. 
And when he’s done I give him 
A nice warm bubble bath! 

My grades are so much better now, 
Which makes my parents glad. 
Freddie is the smartest dog 
That I have ever had!

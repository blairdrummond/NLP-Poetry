title : Moon Grass Rain

1.
 Here, shooting stars linger
 They give out
 A sparkling trail like a cauterized incision
  
 Silver, or amber
 If the moon is low and rising red
  
  
 2.
 And the rain melts the roads
 And the roads
 Can rupture a spleen
 Or oust a kidney stone
  
 As for the heart
 It needs a beginning
 The narrative
 Burden of events
  
  
 3.
 “Mize, zey eat mize”
 The Frenchman exclaimed with a smile
 “Rraized and shipped from za States”
  
 We raise rats! I thought
 That’﻿s a lot of protein!
  
 “Maize maize!” it was, after our chickens
 Have had their fill
  
  
 4.
 She was the only nurse in town before the war
 She spoke seven languages and died suddenly
 He was a merchant
 He’﻿s a doorman now and buys us cigarettes
  
  
 5.
 Here we are with love pouring out of every orifice
 Here they are dancing
 Around the funeral pyre, the corpse in absentia
  
  
 6.
 One of the drivers ran over the neighbor’﻿s ducks
 The neighbor demanded compensation
 For the post-traumatic stress disorder he accurately anticipates
  
 Do you know what it’﻿s like
 To drive on roads occupied
 By animal farms: you cannot tell
 Who killed who or how
 Many ducks were there to begin with
  
  
 7.
 In the morning, elephant grass moves the way
 Mist is visible in the breeze but doesn’﻿t dampen the skin
  
  
 8.
 Today, I yelled at three old women
 Who wouldn’﻿t stop bargaining for pills they didn’﻿t need
 One wanted extra
 For her grandson who came along for the ride
  
  
 9.
 Like lip sores
 The asphalt blisters in the rain
  
 And the boys
 Fill the holes with dirt and gravel
 And broken green branches
 Then wait:
  
 No windex. No flowers or newspapers
 And gratuity is appreciated
  
  
 10.
 “I have ants in my leg”
 And “My leg went to sleep”
 Are not the same thing!
  
 The French argue
 There is no sleep in a tingling numbness
 The symptom of sluggish blood:
  
 I agree. Me too my leg has been anted
 And we are learning to reconcile
 The dark with the electric
  
  
 11.
 Four days the river runs to the border
 Nine days to learn it wasn’﻿t the shape
 Of your nose that gave you away
 And debts are paid off in a-shelter-for-a-day
  
 A pile of wood plus change in your pocket
 Is a sack of potatoes and change in another’﻿s
  
  
 12.
 No more running long or short distance
 The old women
 Snicker at me when I pass them by
  
  
 13.
 She was comatose post-partum
 And the beekeeper
 Bathed her in love everyday
  
 When she recovered I gave up
 What he’﻿d promised me for the woman
 Who took up nursing their newborn
 Since as coincidence would have it
 Her name was Om Assel — Mother of Honey
  
  
 14.
 The translation of a medical interview
 Is not a poem to be written
  
 Come recite a verse from childhood with me
 I see you’﻿re unable to weep, does love
 Have no command over you?
  
 The sea’﻿s like the desert
 Neither quenches the thirst
  
  
 15.
 Here, dry grass burns the moon
 Here, a clearing of grass is a clearing of snakes
  
  
 16.
 And the rain has already been cleansed from the sky
The clinic is empty, soon
The earth will unseal like a jar
Harvest is the season that fills the belly
  
  
 17.
 Here, I ride my bicycle invisible
 Except for a crescent shadow and the Milky Way
 Is already past
  
  
 18.
 And a mirror gives the moon back to the moon
 Home is an epilogue:
  
 Which came first
 Memory or words?

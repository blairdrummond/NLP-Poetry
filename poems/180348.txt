The snake, alphabet of one glide, swims 
with its keepsake head, periscoping, and then 

we lose it in the pond grass, lashed 
among the bottom-feeders. Pocketing goggles, 

my gaze tends pineward, to the driest sky 
in twenty years (also passing, rain predicted), 

a month of sun days. In Fairbanks, all-night baseball 
and a picnic breakfast Alaskan-style. Someone’s 

driving south, to Anchorage, in that luscious uplift 
that here will linger long enough for us 

to get a sunburn, to get down, to get stung, 
to get the hang of happiness and get going. 

Get the picture? I do, but just for the moment, 
which is why I want it monumental, equestrian, 

astride, however I can get it. What’s 
passing is June, another; peony’s scent; postcards 

from the lower forty-eight. The frog I trod sprang back 
intact, all its receptors set on July.

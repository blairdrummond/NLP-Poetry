title : Edward Hopper's New York Movie

We can have our pick of seats. 
Though the movie's already moving, 
the theater's almost an empty shell. 
    All we can see on our side 
of the room is one man and one woman— 
as neat, respectable, and distinct 
    as the empty chairs that come 
between them. But distinctions do not surprise, 
fresh as we are from sullen street and subway 
    where lonelinesses crowded 
about us like unquiet memories 
that may have loved us once or known our love. 
    Here we are an accidental 
fellowship, sheltering from the city's 
obscure bereavements to face a screened, 
    imaginary living, 
as if it were a destination 
we were moving toward. Leaning to our right 
    and suspended before us 
is a bored, smartly uniformed usherette. 
Staring beyond her lighted corner, she finds 
    a reverie that moves through 
and beyond the shine of the silver screening. 
But we can see what she will never see— 
    that she's the star of Hopper's scene. 
For the artist she's a play of light, 
and a play of light is all about her. 
    Whether the future she is 
dreaming is the future she will have 
we have no way of knowing. Whatever 
    it will prove to be 
it has already been. The usherette 
Hopper saw might now be seventy, 
    hunched before a Hitachi 
in an old home or a home for the old. 
She might be dreaming now a New York movie, 
    Fred Astaire dancing and kissing 
Ginger Rogers, who high kicks across New York 
City skylines, raising possibilities 
    that time has served to lower. 
We are watching the usherette, and the subtle 
shadows her boredom makes across her not-quite- 
    impassive face beneath 
the three red-shaded lamps and beside 
the stairs that lead, somehow, to dark streets 
    that go on and on and on. 
But we are no safer here than she. 
Despite the semblance of luxury— 
    gilt edges, red plush, 
and patterned carpet—this is no palace, 
and we do not reign here, except in dreams. 
    This picture tells us much 
about various textures of lighted air, 
but at the center Hopper has placed 
a slab of darkness and an empty chair.

I 

what is most valued, 
the cherished things 
any moment in Iowa 
settles so carelessly 
upon you—cat stickers,   
a coded signal Home 
Orange Juice is trucking by,   
some morning or any day   
when winter spring summer   
and the poem begin again 


II 

who was it started laughing?   
someone otherwise somber,   
the Christmas lariateer   
spinning double circles,   
dancing through the lasso   
at his side, bullwhipping   
cigarettes from his lovely   
assistant’s scarlet mouth   
every hour on the hour 
next to the howling Santa Claus 


III 

would have thought other- 
wise, conceded the point 
at first argument; of course 
there were mornings, the hills 
went on to Cedar Rapids 
and Davenport; in its own season   
the corn’s pollen stung another 
hand; brown rivers paled with ice;   
those were the truck washes we had   
known before, the spit of gravel 
from the humming wheels; the patient   
customer of truck stops knows the best   
of these returns, hulks them into   
the dark of his coffee with rounded   
shoulders and extended forearms 


IV 

it is the line of force or the vector   
that sees us through our ambiguities,   
diagram of rivers, path the semi 
takes among its various winds, turn   
the night makes at a neon sign, EATS,   
locus of all points on the lasso’s rim,   
itself remembered; somehow each of us   
knows the double twist of brittle fiber   
that holds the line together, knows   
the turns the rain takes, heaves 
the long land rests against our feet

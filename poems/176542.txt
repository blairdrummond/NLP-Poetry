title : My Brother’s Bear

author : Bruce Lansky

text : 
My baby brother has a bear 
that travels with him everywhere. 
He never lets the bear from sight. 
He hugs it in his crib at night. 
And when my brother’s diaper smells, 
the name of the bear is what he yells— 
which is a clever thing to do 
because my brother named it Pooh.

title : Arrow Breaking Apart

author : Jason Shinder

text : 
While lovers sleep, I dig my nails into the earth,
  
 holding up traffic. Just now a cloud has pulled up
 while I was talking to the Emptiness
  
 of the Universe and my voice plugged into the waves
  
 at the bottom of the ocean.
 My heart is taped up like a child’s drawing
  
 of the moon over the broken window of the sky
  
 where the wind always comes back to fill my lungs.
 I will dance on my shadow. I will open my mouth
  
 with the air inside my mother’s coffin.
  
 I will be the arrow breaking apart in the body
 of the blackbird, which appears at my window, singing.

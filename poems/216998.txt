title : Mary Shelley in Brigantine

author : Stephen Dunn

text : 
Because the ostracized experience the world 
in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it 
clearly yet with such anger and longing 
that they sometimes enlarge what they see, 
she at first saw Brigantine as a paradise for gulls. 
She must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore. 

How startling, though, no one knew about her past, 
the scandal with Percy, the tragic early deaths, 
yet sad that her Frankenstein had become 
just a name, like Dracula or Satan, something 
that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh. 
She found herself welcome everywhere. 

People would tell her about Brigantine Castle, 
turned into a house of horror. They thought 
she'd be pleased that her monster roamed 
its dark corridors, making children scream. 
They lamented the day it was razed. 
Thus Mary Shelley found herself accepted 

by those who had no monster in them â€”
the most frightening people alive, she thought. 
Didn't they know Frankenstein had abandoned 
his creation, set him loose without guidance 
or a name? Didn't they know what it feels like 
to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are? 

She was amazed now that people believed 
you could shop for everything you might need. 
She loved that in the dunes you could almost hide. 
At the computer store she asked an expert 
if there was such a thing as too much knowledge, 
or going too far? He directed her to a website 

where he thought the answers were. 
Yet Mary Shelley realized that the pain she felt 
all her life was gone. Could her children, dead so young, 
be alive somewhere, too? She couldn't know 
that only her famous mother had such a chance. 
She was almost ready to praise this awful world.

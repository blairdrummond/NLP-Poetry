title : The Rain-Streaked Avenues of Central Queens

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
It ends badly, this glass of wine, 
before you drink it 
you have to drink a prior glass, 
before you sip you gulp, 
before you chug the bottle 
you pour it down your throat, 
before we lie together 
naked, we divorce, before we rest 
we grow old, it ends in chaos, 
               but it is delicious, 
when we wake it is the past, 
we are the faces staring 
from the high lit window, 
the unmet lovers, the rivals 
who do not exist, 
united in a radiance 
that will not fade at dawn.

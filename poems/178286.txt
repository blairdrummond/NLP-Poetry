title : A Real-Life Drama

author : Michael Collier

text : 
This dog standing in the middle of the street, 
tail stiff, fur bushy with fear, and a pedigree rabbit,   
its neck broken and bleeding beneath his paws,   
might have been forgiven or simply taken away 

and shot under different circumstances 
and no one would have said much, except his owner   
who’d gone out into the yard at the start 
of the commotion, having been involved 

at other times with the dog’s truancies, and yelled,   
“Bosco, Bosco, goddamnit!” but unavailing, 
and everyone understanding that once more Bosco   
had been taken over by the dark corner of his nature. 

But this other sentiment we shared as well: the man   
Who’d raised the rabbit shouldn’t husband something   
so rare and beautiful he couldn’t keep it 
from the likes of Bosco.

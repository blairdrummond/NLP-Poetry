title : A Way to Make a Living

author : James Wright

text : 
From an epigram by Plato
When I was a boy, a relative   
Asked for me a job   
At the Weeks Cemetery. 
Think of all I could 
Have raised that summer,   
That money, and me   
Living at home, 
Fattening and getting   
Ready to live my life 
Out on my knees, humming, 
Kneading up docks   
And sumac from 
Those flawless clerks-at-court, those beautiful   
Grocers and judges, the polished 
Dead of whom we make   
So much. 

I could have stayed there with them. 
Cheap, too. 
Imagine, never   
To have turned 
Wholly away from the classic 
Cold, the hill, so laid 
Out, measure by seemly measure clipped 
And mown by old man Albright 
The sexton. That would have been a hell of 
A way to make a living. 

Thank you, no. 
I am going to take my last nourishment 
Of measure from a dark blue 
Ripple on swell on ripple that makes 
Its own garlands. 
My dead are the secret wine jars 
Of Tyrian commercial travelers. 
Their happiness is a lost beginning, their graves   
Drift in and out of the Mediterranean. 

One of these days 
The immortals, clinging to a beam of sunlight   
Under water, delighted by delicate crustaceans,   
Will dance up thirty-foot walls of radiance,   
And waken, 
The sea shining on their shoulders, the fresh   
Wine in their arms. Their ships have drifted away. 
They are stars and snowflakes floating down   
Into your hands, love.

title : Eating Together

I know my friend is going, 
though she still sits there 
across from me in the restaurant,   
and leans over the table to dip 
her bread in the oil on my plate; I know   
how thick her hair used to be,   
and what it takes for her to discard 
her man’s cap partway through our meal,   
to look straight at the young waiter   
and smile when he asks 
how we are liking it. She eats 
as though starving—chicken, dolmata,   
the buttery flakes of filo— 
and what’s killing her 
eats, too. I watch her lift 
a glistening black olive and peel   
the meat from the pit, watch 
her fine long fingers, and her face,   
puffy from medication. She lowers   
her eyes to the food, pretending 
not to know what I know. She’s going.   
And we go on eating.

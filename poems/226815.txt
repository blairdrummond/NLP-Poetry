title : Toys in a Field

author : Yusef Komunyakaa

text : 
Using the gun mounts   
for monkey bars, 
children skin the cat,   
pulling themselves through,   
suspended in doorways   
of abandoned helicopters   
in graveyards. With arms   
spread-eagled they imitate   
vultures landing in fields.   
Their play is silent 
as distant rain, 
the volume turned down   
on the 6 o’clock news,   
except for the boy 
with American eyes 
who keeps singing   
rat-a-tat-tat, hugging   
a broken machine gun.

title : The Gilded Zero

author : Amy King

text : 
Only open homes & woods & pansies’ blue ledges
 can lead the zero with his only arms
 to embrace himself in open fields for all to gape upon.
 He unbuttons steel-gray sheets, a knotted top coat,
 bares himself, his hole, a vision
 as framed by the marker that is 
 where
 his body blew and left enclosure intact,
 skeletal innards
 enough to make moviegoers ask,
 “Has anyone finished themselves yet?”
 I haven’t. I swim the lagoon, take note:
 the babies are barely dirty,
 their armpits smooth with silky soot
 weighted in apartment cycles like
 we keep movement in boxes for thunderstorms,
 and the railroad leaves a dancing behavior
 absorbed by every second thought,
 escaping the socket that was his mission,
 his body incomplete, to help us
 to the maidenhead of Niagara,
 a target awakening
 the chlorophyll of trees,
 their tongues the densest forest
 canopy and floor
 thigh deep with root rot we sleep on and fold
 into growing-whole sheep what becomes of the lot:
 night’s zero hour
 of what is & what isn’t, till death, not us part.

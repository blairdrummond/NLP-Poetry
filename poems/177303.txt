title : What Grieving Was

author : Lynn Emanuel

text : 
That was not the summer of aspic   
and cold veal. It was so hot 

the car seat stung my thighs   
and the rearview mirror swam 

with mirage. In the back seat 
the leather grip was noosed by twine. 

We were not poor but we had   
the troubles of the poor. 

She who had been that soft snore   
beside the Nytol, open-mouthed, 

was gone, somewhere, somewhere   
there was a bay, there was a boat, 

there was a scold in mother’s mouth.   
What I remember best 

is the way everything came and went   
in the window of my brief attention. 

At the wake I was beguiled 
by the chromium yellow lemon pies. 

The grandfather clock’s pendant 
of unaffordable gold told the quarter hour. 

The hearse rolled forward over the O’s   
of its own surprise.

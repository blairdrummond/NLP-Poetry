William cut a hole in his Levi’s pocket 
so he could flop himself out in class 
behind the girls so the other guys 
could see and shit what guts we all said. 
All Konga wanted to do over and over 
was the rubber band trick, but he showed 
everyone how, so nobody wanted to see 
anymore and one day he cried, just cried 
until his parents took him away forever. 
Maya had a Hotpoint refrigerator standing 
in his living room, just for his family to show 
anybody who came that they could afford it.

Me, I got a French kiss, finally, in the catholic
darkness, my tongue’s farthest half vacationing 
loudly in another mouth like a man in Bermudas, 
and my body jumped against a flagstone wall,
I could feel it through her thin, almost
nonexistent body: I had, at that moment, that moment, 
a hot girl on a summer night, the best of all
the things we tried to do. Well, she
let me kiss her, anyway, all over.

Or it was just a flagstone wall
with a flaw in the stone, an understanding cavity 
for burning young men with smooth dreams—
the true circumstance is gone, the true
circumstances about us all then
are gone. But when I kissed her, all water,
she would close her eyes, and they into somewhere 
would disappear. Whether she was there
or not, I remember her, clearly, and she moves 
around the room, sometimes, until I sleep.

I have lain on the desert in watch 
low in the back of a pick-up truck
for nothing in particular, for stars, for
the things behind stars, and nothing comes
more than the moment: always now, here in a truck,
the moment again to dream of making love and sweat, 
this time to a woman, or even to all of them
in some allowable way, to those boys, then,
who couldn’t cry, to the girls before they were
women, to friends, me on my back, the sky over me 
pressing its simple weight into her body 
on me, into the bodies of them all, on me.

title : In Defense of Our Overgrown Garden

Last night the apple trees shook and gave each lettuce a heart 
Six hard red apples broke through the greenhouse glass and 
Landed in the middle of those ever-so-slightly green leaves 
That seem no mix of seeds and soil but of pastels and light and 
Chalk x’s mark our oaks that are supposed to be cut down   
I’ve seen the neighbors frown when they look over the fence 
And see our espalier pear trees bowing out of shape I did like that 
They looked like candelabras against the wall but what’s the sense 
In swooning over pruning I said as much to Mrs. Jones and I swear 
She threw her cane at me and walked off down the street without 
It has always puzzled me that people coo over bonsai trees when 
You can squint your eyes and shrink anything without much of   
A struggle ensued with some starlings and the strawberry nets 
So after untangling the two I took the nets off and watched birds 
With red beaks fly by all morning at the window I reread your letter 
About how the castles you flew over made crenellated shadows on   
The water in the rainbarrel has overflowed and made a small swamp 
I think the potatoes might turn out slightly damp don’t worry 
If there is no fog on the day you come home I will build a bonfire 
So the smoke will make the cedars look the way you like them 
To close I’m sorry there won’t be any salad and I love you

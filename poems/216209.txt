title : Rage for Order

author : Rage for Order David Lunde

text : 
I guess you could call it
 a sort of sympathetic magic.
 How else to explain
 this obsessive reorganizing
 of my home, my books, my papers,
 my poems, this housekeeping
 of my hard drive and floppies,
 all the deleting and casting away
 of redundancy and obsolescence,
 dead files and moved-on addresses
 and the scrubbing, the constant
 scrubbing and dusting and the howl
 of the protesting vacuum
 that struggles to inhale
 at least the 70% of house-dust
 that is dead human skin
 some of which might be hers.

“The fact that we are black  is our ultimate reality.”  —Ron Karenga  

And several strengths from drowsiness campaigned 
but spoke in Single Sermon on the warpland. 

And went about the warpland saying No. 
“My people, black and black, revile the River. 
Say that the River turns, and turn the River. 

Say that our Something in doublepod contains 
sees for the coming hell and health together. 
Prepare to meet 
(sisters, brothers) the brash and terrible weather; 
the pains; 
the bruising; the collapse of bestials, idols. 
But then oh then!—the stuffing of the hulls! 
the seasoning of the perilousl sweet! 
the health! The heralding of the clear obscure! 

Build now your Church, my brothers, sisters. Build 
never with brick or Corten nor with granite. 
Build with lithe love. With love like lion-eyes. 
with love like morningrise. 
with love like black, our black— 
luminously indiscreet; 
complete; continuous.”

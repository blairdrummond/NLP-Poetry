text : 
I have tried to say
 that, although Love is not judgement
 analysis too is a style
 of affect
 since the scale that rends me vulnerable
 has cut, from abundance, doubt
 (not that identity shunts
 civic ratio or consequence) Sure —
 I would prefer to respond to only
 the established charms (and forget inconvenience)
 but her hair was also a kind of honey
 or instrument.
  
 All that is beautiful, from which I choose
 even artifice, which I hold above nature
 won’t salve these stuttered accoutrements

Pastoral

      A Load of brushes and baskets and cradles and chairs
            Labours along the street in the rain:
With it a man, a woman, a pony with whiteybrown hairs. ?
      The man foots in front of the horse with a shambling sway
            At a slower tread than a funeral train,
      While to a dirge-like tune he chants his wares,
Swinging a Turk's-head brush (in a drum-major's way
                  When the bandsmen march and play).

A yard from the back of the man is the whiteybrown pony's nose:
He mirrors his master in every item of pace and pose:
            He stops when the man stops, without being told,
      And seems to be eased by a pause; too plainly he's old,
                  Indeed, not strength enough shows
            To steer the disjointed waggon straight,
      Which wriggles left and right in a rambling line,
      Deflected thus by its own warp and weight,
      And pushing the pony with it in each incline.

            The woman walks on the pavement verge,
                  Parallel to the man:
      She wears an apron white and wide in span,
And carries a like Turk's-head, but more in nursing-wise:
      Now and then she joins in his dirge,
      But as if her thoughts were on distant things,
      The rain clams her apron till it clings. ?
So, step by step, they move with their merchandize,
                  And nobody buys.

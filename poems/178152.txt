title : Tarantulas on the Lifebuoy

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
For some semitropical reason   
when the rains fall   
relentlessly they fall 

into swimming pools, these otherwise   
bright and scary 
arachnids. They can swim 
a little, but not for long 

and they can’t climb the ladder out. 
They usually drown—but   
if you want their favor, 
if you believe there is justice,   
a reward for not loving 

the death of ugly 
and even dangerous (the eel, hog snake,   
rats) creatures, if 

you believe these things, then   
you would leave a lifebuoy 
or two in your swimming pool at night. 

And in the morning   
you would haul ashore 
the huddled, hairy survivors 

and escort them 
back to the bush, and know, 
be assured that at least these saved,   
as individuals, would not turn up 

again someday 
in your hat, drawer, 
or the tangled underworld 

of your socks, and that even— 
when your belief in justice 
merges with your belief in dreams— 
they may tell the others 

in a sign language   
four times as subtle 
and complicated as man’s 

that you are good,   
that you love them, 
that you would save them again.

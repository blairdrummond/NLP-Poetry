1  hat    


As soon as I put it on 
Brooklyn went dark, 
but when I took it off 
my wooden horse stared at me 
with dazzling glass eyes. 


                  2  coat    

The shirred hem 
swished on the floor. 
Huge shoulders sloped 
like pines under snow. 
A panel in the lapel 
read Kuut, Tallinn 
in thread letters. 
I hid at the center 
behind jet buttons 
too round to undo. 
That coarse-nap wool 
outlasted Estonian winter 
but now the moths 
left a trellis of holes 
so it was never dark 
when I curled up 
hugging my knees. 
My mother cried out: 
Who are you?   I answered 
in my deepest voice: 
His coat.  


                  3  shoes    

I shoved my hands in 
and taught them to walk: 
now stumble, now march 
against your will, left, right, 
to the Narva front: 

now dance: 
                  and somewhere 
in that immense city 
where snow trembled 
in high lit windows, 
a footstep receded, 
rapid, urgent, 
indelible as a name.

You can read almost anything
 about angels, how they bite off
 the heads first, copulate with tigers,
 tortured Miles Davis until he stuck
 a mute in his trumpet to torture them back.
 The pornographic magazines ported
 into the redwoods. The sweetened breath
 of the starving. The prize livestock
 rolls over on her larval young,
 the wooden dwarf turning in the cogs
 of the clockworks. I would have
 a black bra hanging from the shower rod.
 I would have you up against 
 the refrigerator with its magnets
 for insurance agents and oyster bars.
 Miracles, ripped thumbnails,
 everything a piece of something else,
 archangelic, shadow-clawed,
 the frolicking despair of repeating
 decimals because it never comes out even.
 Mostly the world is lava’s rhythm,
 the impurities of darkness
 sometimes called stars. Mostly
 the world is assignations, divorces
 conducted between rooftops. Forever
 and forever the checkbook unbalanced,
 the beautiful bodies bent back
 like paper clips, the discharged
 blandishing cardboard signs by the exits.
 Coppers and silvers and radiant traces,
 gold flecks from our last brush,
 brushfires. Always they’re espousing
 accuracy when it’s accident, the arrow
 not in the aimed-for heart but throat
 that has the say. There are no transitions,
 only falls.

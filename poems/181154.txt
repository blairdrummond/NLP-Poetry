You used to be able to flag a ride in this country.   
Impossible now—everyone is afraid    
of strangers.   Well, there was fear then too,   
and it was mutual: drivers versus hitchhikers.   
And we rode without seat belts,   
insurance or beliefs.  People   
would see me far ahead on a hill like a seedling,   
watch me grow in the windshield   
and not know they were going to stop until   
they got right up to me.  Maybe they wanted   
company or thought I’d give them   
some excitement.  It was the age   
of impulse, of lonesome knee jerks.  An old woman   
stopped, blew smoke in my face   
and after I was already in her car she asked me   
if I wanted a ride.  I’m telling you.   
Late one night a construction boss pulled over.   
One of his crew had been hit   
by the mob, he said as he drove, distraught   
and needing to talk to someone.   
We rode around for a long time.   
He said, I never wore a gun to a funeral before,   
but they’ve gotta be after me too.   
Then he looked at me and patted the bulge   
in his coat.  Don’t worry, he said, you’re safe.

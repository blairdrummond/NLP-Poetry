title : My Brother

My brother’s worth about two cents, 
As far as I can see. 
I simply cannot understand 
Why they would want a “he.” 

He spends a good part of his day 
Asleep inside the crib, 
And when he eats, he has to wear 
A stupid baby bib. 

He cannot walk and cannot talk 
And cannot throw a ball. 
In fact, he can’t do anything— 
He’s just no fun at all. 

It would have been more sensible, 
As far as I can see, 
Instead of getting one like him 
To get one just like me.

 I
 His holy
             slowly
                         mulled over
    matter
  
 not all “delirium
             of delight”
                         as were the forests 
    of Brazil
  
 “Species are not
             (it is like confessing
                         a murder)
    immutable”
  
 He was often becalmed
             in this Port Desire by illness
                         or rested from species
    at billiard table
  
 As to Man
             “I believe Man… 
                         in the same predicament
    with other animals”
  
  
 II
 Cordilleras to climb—Andean
             peaks “tossed about
                         like the crust
    of a broken pie”
  
 Icy wind
             Higher, harder
                         Chileans advised eat onions
    for shortness of breath
  
 Heavy on him:
             Andes miners carried up
                         great loads—not allowed
    to stop for breath
  
 Fossil bones near Santa Fé
             Spider-bite-scauld
                         Fever
    Tended by an old woman
  
 “Dear Susan… 
             I am ravenous
                         for the sound
    of the pianoforte”
  
  
 III
 FitzRoy blinked—
             sea-shells on mountain tops!
                         The laws of change
    rode the seas
  
 without the good captain
             who could not concede
                         land could rise from the sea
    until—before his eyes
  
 earthquake—
             Talcahuana Bay drained out—
                         all-water wall
    up from the ocean
  
 —six  seconds—
             demolished the town
                         The will of God?
    Let us pray
  
 And now the Galápagos Islands—
             hideous black lava
                         The shore so hot
    it burned their feet
  
 through their boots
             Reptile life
                         Melville here later
    said the chief sound was a hiss
  
 A thousand turtle monsters
             drive together to the water
                         Blood-bright crabs hunt ticks
    on lizards’ backs
  
 Flightless cormorants
             Cold-sea creatures—
                         penguins, seals
    here in tropical waters
  
 Hell for FitzRoy
             but for Darwin Paradise Puzzle
                         with the jig-saw gists
    beginning to fit
  
  
 IV
 Years… balancing
             probabilities
                         I am ill, he said
    and books are slow work
  
 Studied pigeons
             barnacles, earthworms
                         Extracted seeds
    from bird dung
  
 Brought home Drosera—
             saw insects trapped
                         by its tentacles—the fact
    that a plant should secrete
  
 an acid acutely akin
             to the digestive fluid
                         of an animal! Years
    till he published
  
 He wrote Lyell: Don’t forget
             to send me the carcass
                         of your half-bred African cat
    should it die
  
  
 V
 I remember, he said
             those tropical nights at sea—
                         we sat and talked
    on the booms
  
 Tierra del Fuego’s
             shining glaciers translucent
                         blue clear down
    (almost) to the indigo sea
  
 (By the way Carlyle
             thought it most ridiculous
                         that anyone should care
    whether a glacier
  
 moved a little quicker
             or a little slower
                         or moved at all)
    Darwin
  
 sailed out
             of Good Success Bay
                         to carcass-
    conclusions—
  
 the universe
             not built by brute force
                         but designed by laws
    The details left
  
 to the working of chance
             “Let each man hope
                         and believe
    what he can”

Simile, Rhymed Stanza

Margaret, in happy hour
Christen'd from that humble flower
      Which we a daisy call!
May thy pretty name-sake be
In all things a type of thee,
      And image thee in all.

Like it you show a modest face,
An unpretending native grace;--
      The tulip, and the pink,
The china and the damask rose,
And every flaunting flower that blows,
      In the comparing shrink.

Of lowly fields you think no scorn;
Yet gayest gardens would adorn,
      And grace, wherever set.
Home-seated in your lonely bower,
Or wedded--a transplanted flower--
      I bless you, Margaret!

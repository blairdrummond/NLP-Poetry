title : Meditation on Statistical Method

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
Plato, despair! 
We prove by norms 
How numbers bear 
Empiric forms, 

How random wrong 
Will average right 
If time be long 
And error slight, 

But in our hearts 
Hyperbole 
Curves and departs 
To infinity. 

Error is boundless. 
Nor hope nor doubt, 
Though both be groundless, 
Will average out.

Rhymed Stanza

Let it be forgotten, as a flower is forgotten, 
   Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold, 
Let it be forgotten for ever and ever, 
   Time is a kind friend, he will make us old. 

If anyone asks, say it was forgotten 
   Long and long ago, 
As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall 
   In a long forgotten snow.

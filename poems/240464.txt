title : Harmless, Recalled as a Fairy Tale

After our rendez-vous—this the last word he said,
 Waving to me as the train pulled away from the station.
 And so it seemed: harmless. Till evening brought
 The first prick of fever, which soon trellised my veins;
 At 2 AM came that knock on the city gates, 
 Little pig, little pig, let me come in. . . .
 Ha! ever a bold and warlike people, we didn’t.
  
 Days of siege. We threw corpses dead of plague
 From the tops of parapets to frighten it away:
 But what was it? That vatic voice was not like his at all,
 and by its speech one could tell it somehow knew us well.
 The mystery deepened. A strange billowing cloud
 Made my people short of breath, I heard them wheezing.
 The end seemed near. What could this ailment be?
  
 Hunting  out clues, I went over the roses and snows
 Of his departed face like a treasure map, over
 His words hanging in air like the scrolls of Alexandria.
 Had I not been consensual, a free agent,
 Gay, single as any singing lark, who
 Chooses to unlock, to whom? Well?
 One night, finally, I climbed our tallest tower, lay
  
 In the open on its roof and had a brilliant dream.
 I saw my body nestled between angels
 Like the body of the prophet Jesus, I saw it
 Leaking from a finger’s tip like a slit ragdoll.
 And then I saw: this feathery, amorphous creature
 Black as mildew in the bath, soft as bread mold,
 Chewing on my bloodpuddings in the corner.
  
 And then I knew! That morning, I went out by the porter’s door
 Pressing one finger to judicious lips like Oedipus.
 Your name, I said, I have it now: Despair—
 Shrieking, it vanished with brimstone and flames.
 So I etched Harmless in that ground of merds and moss
 And to this day, my people listen to strangers crying wares
 With an intelligent ear, remembering our grave old danger.

title : from Second Book of Odes: 6. What the Chairman Told Tom

author : Basil Bunting

text : 
Poetry? It’s a hobby.   
I run model trains. 
Mr Shaw there breeds pigeons. 

It’s not work. You dont sweat.   
Nobody pays for it.   
You could advertise soap. 

Art, that’s opera; or repertory—   
The Desert Song.   
Nancy was in the chorus. 

But to ask for twelve pounds a week—   
married, aren’t you?—   
you’ve got a nerve. 

How could I look a bus conductor   
in the face 
if I paid you twelve pounds? 

Who says it’s poetry, anyhow?   
My ten year old   
can do it and rhyme. 

I get three thousand and expenses,   
a car, vouchers, 
but I’m an accountant. 

They do what I tell them,   
my company.   
What do you do? 

Nasty little words, nasty long words,   
it’s unhealthy. 
I want to wash when I meet a poet. 

They’re Reds, addicts,   
all delinquents. 
What you write is rot. 

Mr Hines says so, and he’s a schoolteacher,   
he ought to know. 
Go and find work.

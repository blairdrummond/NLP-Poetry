text : 
If, in an odd angle of the hutment, 
A puppy laps the water from a can 
Of flowers, and the drunk sergeant shaving   
Whistles O Paradiso!—shall I say that man   
Is not as men have said: a wolf to man? 

The other murderers troop in yawning;   
Three of them play Pitch, one sleeps, and one   
Lies counting missions, lies there sweating   
Till even his heart beats: One; One; One. 
O murderers! ... Still, this is how it’s done: 

This is a war.... But since these play, before they die,   
Like puppies with their puppy; since, a man, 
I did as these have done, but did not die— 
I will content the people as I can 
And give up these to them: Behold the man! 

I have suffered, in a dream, because of him,   
Many things; for this last saviour, man, 
I have lied as I lie now. But what is lying? 
Men wash their hands, in blood, as best they can:   
I find no fault in this just man.

title : Sonnet 16

author : Richard Barnfield

text : 
Long have I long’d to see my love againe,
    Still have I wisht, but never could obtaine it;
    Rather than all the world (if I might gaine it)
Would I desire my love’s sweet precious gaine.
Yet in my soule I see him everie day,
    See him, and see his still sterne countenaunce,
    But (ah) what is of long continuance,
Where majestie and beautie beares the sway?
Sometimes, when I imagine that I see him,
    (As love is full of foolish fantasies)
    Weening to kisse his lips, as my love’s fees,
I feele but aire: nothing but aire to bee him.
    Thus with Ixion, kisse I clouds in vaine:
    Thus with Ixion, feele I endles paine.

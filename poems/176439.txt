title : I Could Not Tell

author : Sharon Olds

I could not tell I had jumped off that bus, 
that bus in motion, with my child in my arms, 
because I did not know it. I believed my own story:   
I had fallen, or the bus had started up 
when I had one foot in the air. 

I would not remember the tightening of my jaw,   
the irk that I’d missed my stop, the step out   
into the air, the clear child 
gazing about her in the air as I plunged 
to one knee on the street, scraped it, twisted it,   
the bus skidding to a stop, the driver 
jumping out, my daughter laughing 
Do it again. 

I have never done it   
again, I have been very careful. 
I have kept an eye on that nice young mother 
who lightly leapt 
off the moving vehicle 
onto the stopped street, her life 
in her hands, her life’s life in her hands.

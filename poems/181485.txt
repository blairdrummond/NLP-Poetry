1981,   
                  &  for three days in Nebraska 
penny loafers are the talk, the thirties sensation 
all over again in one-light towns. 
          Three days in Nebraska, 
&  a hundred calves come out bloody &   new 
          as Wahoo &  Alma &  Dunning hum 

&  glow, turned liked searchlights into 
Colorado, where everyone’s already wearing 
          their lucky shoes. 
It takes just one look at a boy from Ansley— 
there is love &  there is money 
          &  there is everything in between, 
             touched by both— 
one look at the packs approaching the drag 
in Imperial, 
as first &  second boy say hey & hey to third 
&  fourth— 

          Three days in Nebraska, 
          &  the bigger 
the sentiment, the harder it falls, &    all over 
the dreams of the pretty 
          end somewhere in New York City, 
but just this one time, 
                                  just these three days   
in Nebraska, the boys are clicking their boots 
&  singing 
          I wish I was here in Nebraska

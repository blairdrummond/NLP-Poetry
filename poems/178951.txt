title : A Plagued Journey

author : Maya Angelou

text : 
There is no warning rattle at the door   
nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards.   
Safe in the dark prison, I know that   
light slides over 
the fingered work of a toothless   
woman in Pakistan. 
Happy prints of 
an invisible time are illumined.   
My mouth agape 
rejects the solid air and 
lungs hold. The invader takes   
direction and 
seeps through the plaster walls.   
It is at my chamber, entering   
the keyhole, pushing 
through the padding of the door.   
I cannot scream. A bone 
of fear clogs my throat. 
It is upon me. It is 
sunrise, with Hope 
its arrogant rider. 
My mind, formerly quiescent 
in its snug encasement, is strained 
to look upon their rapturous visages,   
to let them enter even into me.   
I am forced 
outside myself to 
mount the light and ride joined with Hope. 

Through all the bright hours   
I cling to expectation, until   
darkness comes to reclaim me 
as its own. Hope fades, day is gone   
into its irredeemable place 
and I am thrown back into the familiar   
bonds of disconsolation. 
Gloom crawls around 
lapping lasciviously 
between my toes, at my ankles,   
and it sucks the strands of my   
hair. It forgives my heady   
fling with Hope. I am 
joined again into its 
greedy arms.

title : Remarks on Poetry and the Physical World

author : Mary Barnard

text : 
After reading Ash Wednesday 
she looked once at the baked beans   
and fled. Luncheonless, poor girl,   
she observed a kind of poetic Lent— 
and I had thought I liked poetry   
better than she did. 

I do. But to me its most endearing 
quality is its unsuitableness; 
and, conversely, the chief wonder in heaven   
(whither I also am sometimes transported)   
is the kind of baggage I bring with me. 

Surely there is no more exquisite jointure   
in the anatomy of life than that at which   
poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal   
and Mrs. B. sits murmuring of avocados.

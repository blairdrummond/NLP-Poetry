title : About the Teeth of Sharks

author : John Ciardi

text : 
The thing about a shark is—teeth, 
One row above, one row beneath. 

Now take a close look. Do you find 
It has another row behind? 

Still closer—here, I’ll hold your hat: 
Has it a third row behind that? 

Now look in and...Look out! Oh my, 
I’ll never know now! Well, goodbye.

text : 
Chide me not, darling, that I sing 
Familiar thoughts and metres old: 
Nay, do not scold 
My spirit’s childish uttering. 

I know not why ’t is that or this 
I murmur to you thus or so: 
Only I know 
It throbs across my silences, 

It blows over my heart,—a long 
Infinite wind, again, again! 
Again! and then 
My life kneels down into a song.

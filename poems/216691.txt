title : [It's been two thousand years now]

author : Marie-Claire Bancquart

text : 
It's been two thousand years now that, with a wounded leg,   
the god's amazing loves have dragged along.   

He has aged. Soon   
he won't be noticed except from way up in a plane   
in the markings of wheat   
that yield the trace   
of an ancient sanctuary.   

He solicits a language of caresses,   
open pasture, available bodies,   

and the words refuse, and this elsewhere is already in his death   
except for a slender purple flower under the sun.   

He can still act the god all around,   
evening's worn heart.   

He guesses the flower will slip   
fragile   
from one century to the next with its prayer.

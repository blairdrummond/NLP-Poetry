For Donald Clark
Drugged and drowsy but not asleep 
I heard my blind roommate's daughter   
helping her with her meal: 
“What's that? Squash?” 
“No. It's spinach.” 

Back from a brain-scan, she dozed   
to the sound of the Soaps: adultery,   
amnesia, shady business deals,   
and long, white hospital halls....   
No separation between life and art. 

I heard two nurses whispering: 
Mr. Malcomson had died. 
An hour later one of them came to say   
that a private room was free. 

A chill spring breeze 
perturbed the plastic drape.   
I lay back on the new bed,   
and had a vision of souls 
stacked up like pelts 
under my soul, which was ill— 
so heavy with grief 
it kept the others from rising. 

No varicolored tubes 
serpentined beneath the covers;   
I had the vital signs of a healthy,   
early-middle-aged woman. 
There was nothing to cut or dress,   
remove or replace. 

A week of stupor. Sun and moon 
rose and set over the small enclosed   
court, the trees.... 
The doctor’s face appeared 
and disappeared 
over the foot of the bed. By slow degrees   
the outlandish sadness waned. 

Restored to my living room 
I looked at the tables, chairs, and pictures   
with something like delight,   
only pale, faint—as from a great height. 
I let the phone ring; the mail   
accrued unopened 
on the table in the hall.

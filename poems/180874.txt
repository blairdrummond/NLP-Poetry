title : Do Not Make Things Too Easy

author : Martha Baird

text : 
Do not make things too easy. 
There are rocks and abysses in the mind 
As well as meadows. 
There are things knotty and hard: intractable. 
Do not talk to me of love and understanding. 
I am sick of blandishments. 
I want the rock to be met by a rock. 
If I am vile, and behave hideously, 
Do not tell me it was just a misunderstanding.

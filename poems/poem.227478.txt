Common Measure

from An Evening's Love
You charm'd me not with that fair face 
      Though it was all divine: 
To be another's is the grace, 
      That makes me wish you mine. 

   The Gods and Fortune take their part 
      Who like young monarchs fight; 
And boldly dare invade that heart 
      Which is another's right. 

   First mad with hope we undertake 
      To pull up every bar; 
But once possess'd, we faintly make 
      A dull defensive war. 

   Now every friend is turn'd a foe 
      In hope to get our store: 
And passion makes us cowards grow, 
      Which made us brave before.

title : 44th Birthday Evening, at Harris’s

author : Ted Berrigan

text : 
Nine stories high Second Avenue 
On the roof there’s a party 
All the friends are there watching 
By the light of the moon the blazing sun 
Go down over the side of the planet 
To light up the underside of Earth 
There are long bent telescopes for the friends 
To watch this through. The friends are all in shadow. 
I can see them from my bed inside my head.
 44 years I’ve loved these dreams today. 
17 years since I wrote for the first time a poem 
On my birthday, why did I wait so long? 
                                                                         my land a good land 
its highways go to many good places where 
many good people were found; a home land, whose song comes up 
from the throat of a hummingbird & it ends
 where the sun goes to across the skies of blue. 
I live there with you.

title : But It Says Nothing

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
But it says nothing. And one is as quiet
 as if to say nothing moves me. Then
 there is the chair. And one speaks of 
 the chair sitting at the table.
 Scraping against surfaces, opening the mouth.
 The object is a piece of thing before. One
 shifts in a chair and opens the talk.
 And the time it says nothing one moves.
 The table is too long as the wall. Not
 a thing but it stays and one opens
 as a mouth will begin. Speaking of
 the table, nothing but to avoid that of
 the wall. One could return over and over
 to the chair, the wall one is sitting at.
 Least ways it says nothing. And the
 thing is, it stays still before
 speaking of. The object of nothing, even
 speech.

title : As My Life is a Dream

author : Chungmi Kim

I painted a phoenix in bright colors
 cut it in nine pieces and cooked it
 in a pot at the mountaintop.
 I stirred it as if cranking reels of
 a movie. Unraveled were a series
 of faces in mosaic.

 Kurosawa appeared. He asked me
 what my story was about.
 Tongue-tied, I could not answer.
 He handed me a token with a silvery
 eagle engraved, ready to fly.

 How real I thought everything was
 in my dream!

 In my waking hour, I see
 the remnant of the war between
 my head and heart.

 Now in cease-fire, my chest is filled
with the fresh breeze of serenity.
I begin to breathe gently as my story
is unraveled like in a movie.

 No longer haunted, my love of God soars
 as I see my guardian angel smile
 in the clear blue sky, transforming to
 one gigantic phoenix.

 My wandering in the wilderness of
 the mind has taught me a little wisdom.
 I believe my dreams are real
as my life is a dream.

title : Snow Becoming Light

author : Morning

text : 
In case you sit across from the meteorologist tonight, 
and in case the dim light over the booth in the bar still shines 
almost planetary on your large, smooth, winter-softened 
forehead, in case all of the day—its woods and play, its fire— 
has stayed on your beard, and will stay through the slight 
drift of mouth, the slackening of even your heart's muscle— 
 . . . well. I am filled with snow. There's nothing to do now 
but wait.

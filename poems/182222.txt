text : 
I was four in this photograph fishing 
with my grandparents at a lake in Michigan. 
My brother squats in poison ivy. 
His Davy Crockett cap 
sits squared on his head so the raccoon tail 
flounces down the back of his sailor suit. 

My grandfather sits to the far right 
in a folding chair, 
and I know his left hand is on 
the tobacco in his pants pocket 
because I used to wrap it for him 
every Christmas. Grandmother's hips 
bulge from the brush, she's leaning 
into the ice chest, sun through the trees 
printing her dress with soft 
luminous paws. 

I am staring jealously at my brother; 
the day before he rode his first horse, alone. 
I was strapped in a basket 
behind my grandfather. 
He smelled of lemons. He's diedâ€”

but I remember his hands.

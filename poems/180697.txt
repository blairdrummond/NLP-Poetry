title : The Dream of a Lover

text : 
Benedicite! whate dreamed I this nyght?
Methought the worlde was turnyd up so downe
The sun, the moone had lost their force and lyght,
The sea also drowned both toure and towne.
Yet more marvel how that I heard the sounde
Of onys voice saying: beare in thy mynd,
Thi lady hath forgotten to be kynd.

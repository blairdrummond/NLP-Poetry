title : The Mayor of Scuttleton

text : 
The Mayor of Scuttleton burned his nose 
Trying to warm his copper toes; 
He lost his money and spoiled his will 
By signing his name with an icicle-quill; 
He went bare-headed, and held his breath, 
And frightened his grandame most to death; 
He loaded a shovel, and tried to shoot, 
And killed the calf in the leg of his boot; 
He melted a snow-bird, and formed the habit 
Of dancing jigs with a sad Welsh rabbit; 
He lived on taffy, and taxed the town; 
And read his newspaper upside down; 
Then he sighed, and hung his hat on a feather, 
And bade the townspeople come together; 
But the worst of it all was, nobody knew 
What the Mayor of Scuttleton next would do.

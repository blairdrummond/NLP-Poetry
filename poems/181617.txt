The woman on the mantel, 
who doesn't much resemble me, 
is holding a chainsaw 
away from her body, 
with a shocked smile, 
while an undiscovered tumor 
squats on her kidney.

The present 
is a sentimental favorite, 
with its heady mix 
of grandiosity 
and abjection, 
truncated, 
framed.

It's as if I'm subletting 
a friend's apartment. 
Even in the dream, 
I'm trying to imagine   
which friend. 

And I'm trying to get 
all my robes together, 
robes I really own and 
robes I don't

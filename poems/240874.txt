title : Hunter's Moon

author : Molly Fisk

text : 
Early December, dusk, and the sky 
slips down the rungs of its blue ladder 
into indigo. A late-quarter moon hangs 
in the air above the ridge like a broken plate 
and shines on us all, on the new deputy 
almost asleep in his four-by-four, 
lulled by the crackling song of the dispatcher, 
on the bartender, slowly wiping a glass 
and racking it, one eye checking the game. 
It shines down on the fox’s red and grey life, 
as he stills, a shadow beside someone’s gate, 
listening to winter. Its pale gaze caresses 
the lovers, curled together under a quilt, 
dreaming alone, and shines on the scattered 
ashes of terrible fires, on the owl’s black flight, 
on the whelks, on the murmuring kelp, 
on the whale that washed up six weeks ago 
at the base of the dunes, and it shines 
on the backhoe that buried her.

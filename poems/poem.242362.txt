Couplet, Epigram

God's name is bare of honour in our hearing, 
 And even worn out with our blasphemous swearing. 
 Between the infant and the aged, both
 The first and last they utter, is an oath. 
 Oh hellish manners of our profane age. 
 Jehovah's fear is scoffed upon the stage,
 The Mimicking jester, names it every day;
 Unless God is blashphem'd, it is no play.

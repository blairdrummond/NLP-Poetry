title : Amusing Our Daughters

author : Carolyn Kizer

text : 
after Po Chü-i, for Robert Creeley
We don’t lack people here on the Northern coast, 
But they are people one meets, not people one cares for.   
So I bundle my daughters into the car 
And with my brother poets, go to visit you, brother. 

Here come your guests! A swarm of strangers and children; 
But the strangers write verses, the children are daughters like yours.   
We bed down on mattresses, cots, roll up on the floor: 
Outside, burly old fruit trees in mist and rain; 
In every room, bundles asleep like larvae. 

We waken and count our daughters. Otherwise, nothing happens.   
You feed them sweet rolls and melon, drive them all to the zoo;   
Patiently, patiently, ever the father, you answer their questions.   
Later, we eat again, drink, listen to poems. 
Nothing occurs, though we are aware you have three daughters   
Who last year had four. But even death becomes part of our ease:   
Poems, parenthood, sorrow, all we have learned 
From these of tenderness, holds us together 
In the center of life, entertaining daughters 
By firelight, with cake and songs. 

You, my brother, are a good and violent drinker,   
Good at reciting short-line or long-line poems.   
In time we will lose all our daughters, you and I, 
Be temperate, venerable, content to stay in one place,   
Sending our messages over the mountains and waters.

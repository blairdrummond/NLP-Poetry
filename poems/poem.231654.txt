Common Measure

(SUGGESTED INSCRIPTION PROBABLY NOT SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE)
The hucksters haggle in the mart 
The cars and carts go by; 
Senates and schools go droning on; 
For dead things cannot die. 

A storm stooped on the place of tombs 
With bolts to blast and rive; 
But these be names of many men 
The lightning found alive. 

If usurers rule and rights decay 
And visions view once more 
Great Carthage like a golden shell 
Gape hollow on the shore, 

Still to the last of crumbling time 
Upon this stone be read 
How many men of England died 
To prove they were not dead.

title : Arthrocereus Spinosissimus

author : Jonathan Skinner

text : 
frequents an area thousands of miles
from its generally accepted habitat
feeds on slave wages, & crystalline
grasp of the worth of each individual

is sick of growing between rocks
wants to articulate and flex carapace
numb with apparent survival

or to hop about the lawn pecking
bird-witted, on sissy little brother
arthritic serious and bristling candle




Brazil (Mato Grosso)

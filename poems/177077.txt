Bedfordshire 
A blue bird showing off its undercarriage   
En route between our oldest universities 
Was observed slightly off-course above Woburn   
In the leafy heart of our sleepiest county: 
Two cyclists in tandem looked up at the same moment,   
Like a busy footnote to its asterisk. 

   Berkshire 
Once on the causeway outside Steventon   
I had a vision of living in willing exile,   
Of living the knowingly imperfect life   
But with a boundless and joyous energy   
Like Borodin played by the North Berkshire   
Youth Orchestra in its early days. 

   Buckinghamshire 
A goose in the garden of the second-best pub 
In Marsh Gibbon was busy doing its dirty toothpaste   
And noisy, too, when a woman staggered out   
Of the lounge bar into the deserted car-park   
Saying: ‘I could never think of the child at my breast   
As anything other than a penis with a mouth.’ 

   Cambridgeshire 
The bird arrived. Nothing so stately-exciting   
As Handel’s dusky queen that was unspooling   
Perhaps too loudly from a scribbling student cell,   
But looped between the trees, a flash of green: 
And only the having chanced to look just there   
Could tell you it had ever been away. 

   Cheshire 
There was a young woman of Cheadle, who wore her heart 
Upon her sleeve, bright chevron! Oh, the keen-eyed   
Men of Cheadle, as in the jealous month 
When the registration numbers of new estate cars   
Change all over wealthy suburban Cheshire, 
And they picked out her heart with a needle. 

   Cornwall 
The very last cat to speak Cornish had a glass eye 
And kept a corner shop, selling shoe-laces and bullseyes,   
Brasso and Reckitt’s Blue. My great-aunt remembers   
Buying postcards from him as a girl, 
When George’s profile sped them for a penny. 
Aching to talk, he died of pure loneliness. 

   Cumberland 
They play bezique in Threlkeld and they play   
For keeps in Shap. And all the shapely clouds   
Roll through the streets like weeping chemistry   
Or cows escaped. And tea is served in the lounge   
Over a jig-saw puzzle of the Princess Elizabeth   
Beneath wet panes, wet mountains and wet sky. 

   Derbyshire 
Once upon a time, in Derbyshire’s leaking basement   
Where you lie back in boats and quant by walking the ceiling, 
A strange girl in the dripping darkness attached   
Her damp lips to mine fast, like a snail’s adherence   
To cold stone in dusty nettles, and all unseeen 
The bluejohn slid by me: yellows, greys and purples. 

   Devon 
You will never forget the fish market at Barnstaple:   
Wet gills, double bellies, gleaming scales, 
Shells like spilt treasure. And the cream there thicker   
Than a virgin’s dream, and Devon’s greatest poet   
Born Gay, on Joy Street, taught by Robert Luck:   
It is the paradise of all fat poets. 

   Dorset 
When the old woman entered the sea at Charmouth   
And the great waves hung over her head like theatre curtains, 
I thought of the sibyl who charmed the rocks to yield   
Their grainy secrets till history bore down 
Upon her and the liquid world was fixed 
For ever in the era of the fossils. 

   Durham 
At the end of your battered philosophical quest,   
The purity of Durham rises like an exhalation,   
Like the stench of sulphur in a barrel. Birds 
Build in the walls of the cloisters, disappearing into holes 
Like black-robed devotees. Inside it is quiet,   
The oatmeal crimping distant in grey air. 

   Essex 
I had a vision in the dead of night 
Of all the kitchens of commuters’ Essex 
Alight like the heads of snakes; and down them slid   
The bored wives and daughters of the managers   
Who were at the identical time arriving 
On the ladders of their power and fatigue. 

   Gloucestershire 
Armorial memorials reduced 
To leper stone, forests to hedges, hedges 
To sickled stumps where perch the songless birds   
Of Gloucestershire, and vans require the roads   
Before them in their headlights. No one speaks   
In the time it takes to cross the greenest county. 

   Hampshire 
Driving at evening down the A 34 
Like a ski-run, the sun a deiphany, 
The car-radio a percussive Russian insistence:   
Pure pleasure, pure escape! Past Winchester,   
Unseen its stalking scholars, past everything,   
Driving through Hampshire, driving for the boats! 

   Herefordshire 
Alone between the Arrow and the Wye, 
Wales to the west, keeping its rain and secrets,   
I wandered in cider country, where the shade   
Beneath the trees is golden red and noisy 
With the jealous spite of wasps: Ariconium,   
The poet Philips, his long hair combed out! 

   Hertfordshire 
Hertfordshire is full of schoolmasters, 
And archaeologists who are part-time poets.   
Together they apportion past, present   
And future among their imaginary admirers   
In the form of examination papers, foul   
Drafts, and labels of dubious information. 

   Huntingdonshire 
Herds of deer are moving through the trees 
Of Huntingdonshire noisily and rather 
Slowly. An idle hand sweeping the lyre 
Brings tears to the eyes of the moderately rich. 
They will dip their hands in their pockets, gently dip   
But not too deep. You’ve got to keep money moving. 

   Kent 
Old men coming up to bowl remember   
Other old men who in their turn remembered   
Things that were hardly worth remembering   
Through long still nights in Ashford, Faversham,   
Sevenoaks and Tunbridge Wells and Westerham   
Where even now the fields still smell of beer. 

   Lancashire 
All the oven doors of Lancashire 
Swing open on the hour, revealing vast 
Puddings. After tea, the lovers stroll, 
Their hands in each other’s back trouser pockets,   
Feeling the strange swell of the flexing buttock.   
The sun sinks, and the Ribble runs to the sea. 

   Leicestershire 
Cheeks of angels, lips compressed, donate   
To brass invisible impulsions of 
Purely material breath: a county’s children   
Gather to create an overture, 
While brothers and fathers leaping over hedges   
Wind horns to their alternative conclusion. 

   Lincolnshire 
M1, M18, M180: the roads 
With their bright and bowline intersections sweep 
North to Scunthorpe. Go further if you will 
To where the Trent meets the Humber and Lincolnshire ends. 
There, at Alkborough, you may draw breath   
And if Nicky’s at home she will give you a cup of something. 

   Middlesex 
Middlesex is mostly roundabouts, the bright 
Voice of five p.m., insistent infotainment: 
Fingers gallop irritably on the steering-wheel;   
The nails make little clicks. Down the line 
Of fuming stationary Volvos boys bully with headlines   
That tell the drivers all about the place they have come from. 

   Norfolk 
Norfolk is somehow inverted: it’s all sky 
With clouds as bulky as castrati or lines of Dryden   
Sailing out above you, tinged with sunset.   
Get as far as you can, but not too far, 
Say to the Tuesday Market Place at King’s Lynn   
Where all the conveyancing is done in verse. 

   Northamptonshire 
Once half-lost here, when only a map of sounds   
Or smells could lead us from a wood, we came 
At evening to horse-brass and low-timbered beams   
Where the world had evolved to its great public state   
And the men and women of Northampton, being counted 
And with amber drinks, found themselves to be happy. 

   Northumberland 
Traitors’ county: from one end to the other 
You can walk bright-eyed with never a second glance   
From a stocky frowning people who move slowly 
And mind their own business. For they have seen it all:   
When the mist clears over Northumberland   
It leaves squat towers, valleys scarred with lead. 

   Nottinghamshire 
There is one red door in one slightly curved   
Street in one nameless market town 
That contains behind it for a moment an image   
Of the planet’s destiny: a girl stooping 
To a hallway mirror, making her lips move   
Into a theatrical kiss, a self kiss. 

   Oxfordshire 
The kingfisher has long flown. Along the Cherwell   
The biscuit of bridge and college wall is blank   
Of its image, but with a passing presence 
Like a photograph taken with an open shutter.   
This, we reflect, is just the sense of our life, 
Aware of something the very moment that we miss it. 

   Rutland 
Rutland is large enough for you and me 
To stumble into as into a wood without being seen,   
To tread its moss-starred carpet, enchanted   
By the chipped china of the russulas, 
Pink, grey, grey and green-grey, and red, 
Peeping beneath the oaks, not far from Oakham. 

   Shropshire 
Shropshire Blue, still made, the Lord be praised,   
Tart veins that kept the Romans here and Housman   
From the rope. The iron bridges lead you to it,   
Farms knee-deep in cow. And if you stop off   
In red-earthed Bridgnorth, that vigilant town,   
Be sure your pint is not ungraced with cheese. 

   Somerset 
A thousand airy harps! We hardly dare 
To let out breath, for our imagination 
Responds to these full-throated sounds as though   
To the ranks of the ever-delighting dead, our wise   
Visionaries, and this is the county of dreams   
And of the moon’s occult praesidium. 

   Staffordshire 
Staffordshire is where you almost came from,   
Darkened beneath burnt clay, perpetual dusk.   
It is the housewife’s dream, twinkling hearths   
Bright with Zebo, scrubbed pumice steps 
And, in the bathroom, a finger on the nozzle   
And little lavender farts to begin the day. 

   Suffolk 
I’ve had Leigh and buried St Edmunds,   
Stowed Felix and Market and Upland, 
I’ve been shut up in Boxton, found it painful in Akenham 
And felt totally stupid in Assingham: 
Carrying around one’s valuable despair like a fleece,   
To live in Suffolk is to suffocate. 

   Surrey 
Flying in perfect formation above the sleeping   
Cul-de-sacs of Surrey, you observe 
The blocked pairing of houses, each with a garage,   
Like epaulettes. What whisperings behind   
The party walls! What eavesdropping, and what   
Bad timing! Well done! Sorry, partner! Boom! 

   Sussex 
Chalk pie, a quality of sun like laughter, 
Distance predicted in hoof-beats: everywhere here   
Is vigilance as well as cruel amusement, 
That tempered island quality called sardonic.   
From Rye to Selsey Bill, something is on offer, 
A glittering spread, the bottom drawer pulled out. 

   Warwickshire 
Driving to Wales I crossed a corner of Warwickshire   
That seemed to be hardly space at all, the home   
Of Dr Hall and his famous father-in-law 
Or of magic woods where lovers were lost and found,   
But simply the minutes that it took to tell 
An unimportant story, now forgotten. 

   Westmorland 
Once again the skies are open over the whole county:   
From Clifton to Burton, from Grasmere to Brough,   
The pubtalk steaming with anoraks and orange parkas.   
But I can remember one solitary eye 
Raging in silence in the dripping marsh, 
Its dewy lashes spooning aphids from the air. 

   Wiltshire 
In Wiltshire they are sending extra-terrestrial   
Signals: what will the Venusians think of us?   
Four-footed creatures who like to move in circles?   
Let’s hope they never noisily discover 
That we are only half the men they thought us,   
Stumbling at tangents from our glimpsed perfection. 

   Worcestershire 
Oh darling, come to Broadway: there we’ll take   
Tea and scones and jam made from the plums 
Of Pershore, perfect, pitless, palate-pleasing. 
A stroll in the model street, a browse at Gavina’s. 
Then it’s right foot down in the Volvo, plenty of Scotch   
And the largest bed we can find at the Bull in Worcester. 

   Yorkshire 
The brown teapot is always warming here 
For there will be a time when you must come home   
Though you be unknown except to the flowered dead.   
On the moors the diagonal smoke rises 
Like a bitter smile, tight but welcoming: 
Cousin country, extra places for tea.

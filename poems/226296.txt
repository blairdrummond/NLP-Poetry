Matches among other things that were not allowed   
never would be 
lying high in a cool blue box 
that opened in other hands and there they all were   
bodies clean and smooth blue heads white crowns   
white sandpaper on the sides of the box scoring   
fire after fire gone before 

I could hear the scratch and flare   
when they were over 
and catch the smell of the striking 
I knew what the match would feel like   
lighting 
when I was very young 

a fire engine came and parked 
in the shadow of the big poplar tree 
on Fourth Street one night 
keeping its engine running 
pumping oxygen to the old woman 
in the basement 
when she died the red lights went on burning

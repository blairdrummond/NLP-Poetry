Would it surprise you to learn 
 that years beyond your longest winter 
 you still get letters from your bank, your old 
 philanthropies, cold flakes drifting 
 through the mail-slot with your name? 
 Though it's been a long time since your face 
 interrupted the light in my door-frame, 
 and the last tremblings of your voice 
 have drained from my telephone wire, 
 from the lists of the likely, your name 
 is not missing. It circles in the shadow-world 
 of the machines, a wind-blown ghost. For generosity 
 will be exalted, and good credit 
 outlasts death. Caribbean cruises, recipes, 
 low-interest loans. For you who asked 
 so much of life, who lived acutely 
 even in duress, the brimming world 
 awaits your signature. Cancer and heart disease 
 are still counting on you for a cure. 
 B'nai Brith numbers you among the blessed. 
 They miss you. They want you back.

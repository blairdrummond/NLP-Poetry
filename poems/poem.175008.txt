Blank Verse

HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born, 
Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam 
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light, 
And never but in unapproached light 
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, 
Bright effluence of bright essence increate. 
Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, 
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, 
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice 
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest 
The rising world of waters dark and deep, 
Won from the void and formless infinite. 
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, 
Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd 
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight 
Through utter and through middle darkness borne 
With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre 
I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, 
Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down 
The dark descent, and up to reascend, 
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, 
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou 
Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain 
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; 
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, 
Or dim suffusion veild.   Yet not the more 
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt 
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, 
Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief 
Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath 
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, 
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget 
Those other two equal'd with me in Fate, 
So were I equal'd with them in renown, 
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, 
And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. 
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move 
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird 
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid 
Tunes her nocturnal Note.   Thus with the Year 
Seasons return, but not to me returns 
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, 
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, 
Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; 
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark 
Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men 
Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair 
Presented with a Universal blanc 
Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd, 
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. 
So much the rather thou Celestial light 
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers 
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence 
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell 
Of things invisible to mortal sight. 

Now had the Almighty Father from above, 
From the pure Empyrean where he sits 
High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, 
His own works and their works at once to view: 
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven 
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd 
Beatitude past utterance; on his right 
The radiant image of his Glory sat, 
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld 
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two 
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't, 
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, 
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love 
In blissful solitude; he then survey'd 
Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there 
Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night 
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now 
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet 
On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd 
Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament, 
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. 
Him God beholding from his prospect high, 
Wherein past, present, future he beholds, 
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. 

Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage 
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds 
Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains 
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss 
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems 
On desparate reveng, that shall redound 
Upon his own rebellious head.   And now 
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way 
Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light, 
Directly towards the new created World, 
And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay 
If him by force he can destroy, or worse, 
By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert 
For man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, 
And easily transgress the sole Command, 
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall, 
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? 
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee 
All he could have; I made him just and right, 
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. 
Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers 
And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; 
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. 
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere 
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, 
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, 
Not what they would? what praise could they receive? 
What pleasure I from such obedience paid, 
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) 
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, 
Made passive both, had servd necessitie, 
Not mee.   They therefore as to right belongd, 
So were created, nor can justly accuse 
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate, 
As if predestination over-rul'd 
Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree 
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed 
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, 
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, 
Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. 
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, 
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, 
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all 
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so 
I formd them free, and free they must remain, 
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change 
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree 
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd 
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. 
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, 
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd 
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, 
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, 
Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, 
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. 

Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd 
All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect 
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: 
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen 
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon 
Substantially express'd, and in his face 
Divine compassion visibly appeerd, 
Love without end, and without measure Grace, 
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. 

O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd 
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; 
For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll 
Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound 
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne 
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. 
For should Man finally be lost, should Man 
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son 
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd 
With his own folly? that be from thee farr, 
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg 
Of all things made, and judgest onely right. 
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain 
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill 
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, 
Or proud return though to his heavier doom, 
Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell 
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, 
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self 
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, 
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? 
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both 
Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. 

To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd. 
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, 
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone 
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, 
All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all 
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: 
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, 
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me 
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew 
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd 
By sin to foul exorbitant desires; 
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand 
On even ground against his mortal foe, 
By me upheld, that he may know how frail 
His fall'n condition is, and to me ow 
All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. 
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace 
Elect above the rest; so is my will: 
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd 
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes 
Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace 
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, 
What may sufflce, and soft'n stonie hearts 
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. 
To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, 
Though but endevord with sincere intent, 
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. 
And I will place within them as a guide 
My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, 
Light after light well us'd they shall attain, 
And to the end persisting, safe arrive. 
This my long sufferance and my day of grace 
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; 
But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, 
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; 
And none but such from mercy I exclude. 
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, 
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns 
Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n, 
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, 
To expiate his Treason hath naught left, 
But to destruction sacred and devote, 
He with his whole posteritie must dye, 
Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him 
Som other able, and as willing, pay 
The rigid satisfaction, death for death. 
Say Heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, 
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem 
Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, 
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? 

He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, 
And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf 
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, 
Much less that durst upon his own head draw 
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. 
And now without redemption all mankind 
Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell 
By doom severe, had not the Son of God, 
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, 
His dearest mediation thus renewd. 

Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; 
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, 
The speediest of thy winged messengers, 
To visit all thy creatures, and to all 
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, 
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide 
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; 
Attonement for himself or offering meet, 
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: 
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life 
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; 
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave 
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee 
Freely put off, and for him lastly dye 
Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; 
Under his gloomie power I shall not long 
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess 
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, 
Though now to Death I yield, and am his due 
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, 
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave 
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule 
For ever with corruption there to dwell; 
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue 
My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; 
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop 
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. 
I through the ample Air in Triumph high 
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show 
The powers of darkness bound.   Thou at the sight 
Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, 
While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes, 
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: 
Then with the multitude of my redeemd 
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, 
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud 
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, 
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more 
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. 

His words here ended, but his meek aspect 
Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love 
To mortal men, above which only shon 
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice 
Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will 
Of his great Father.   Admiration seis'd 
All Heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend 
Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: 

O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace 
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou 
My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, 
To me are all my works, nor Man the least 
Though last created, that for him I spare 
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, 
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. 
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, 
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; 
And be thy self Man among men on Earth, 
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, 
By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room 
The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. 
As in him perish all men, so in thee 
As from a second root shall be restor'd, 
As many as are restor'd, without thee none. 
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit 
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce 
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, 
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee 
Receive new life.   So Man, as is most just, 
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die, 
And dying rise, and rising with him raise 
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. 
So Heav'nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate 
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, 
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate 
So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes 
In those who, when they may, accept not grace. 
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume 
Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. 
Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss 
Equal to God, and equally enjoying 
God-like fruition, quitted all to save 
A World from utter loss, and hast been found 
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, 
Found worthiest to be so by being Good, 
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee 
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, 
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt 
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; 
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign 
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, 
Anointed universal King, all Power 
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume 
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream 
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: 
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide 
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; 
When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n 
Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send 
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime 
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes 
The living, and forthwith the cited dead 
Of all past Ages to the general Doom 
Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. 
Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge 
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink 
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, 
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.   Mean while 
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring 
New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, 
And after all thir tribulations long 
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, 
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. 
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, 
For regal Scepter then no more shall need, 
God shall be All in All.   But all ye Gods, 
Adore him, who to compass all this dies, 
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. 

No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all 
The multitude of Angels with a shout 
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet 
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung 
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld 
Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent 
Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground 
With solemn adoration down they cast 
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, 
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once 
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life 
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 
To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, 
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, 
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn 
Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream; 
With these that never fade the Spirits elect 
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, 
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright 
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon 
Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. 
Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, 
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side 
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet 
Of charming symphonie they introduce 
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; 
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine 
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. 

Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, 
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, 
Eternal King; thee Author of all being, 
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible 
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st 
Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st 
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud 
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, 
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, 
Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim 
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. 
Thee next they sang of all Creation first, 
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, 
In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud 
Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, 
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee 
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, 
Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. 
Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein 
By thee created, and by thee threw down 
Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day 
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, 
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook 
Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks 
Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. 
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime 
Thee only extoll'd, Son of thy Fathers might, 
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, 
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, 
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome 
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: 
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son 
Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man 
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, 
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife 
Of Mercy and justice in thy face discern'd, 
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat 
Second to thee, offerd himself to die 
For mans offence.   O unexampl'd love, 
Love no where to be found less then Divine! 
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name 
Shall be the copious matter of my Song 
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise 
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. 

Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, 
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. 
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe 
Of this round World, whose first convex divides 
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd 
From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old, 
Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off 
It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent 
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night 
Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms 
Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; 
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n 
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines 
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: 
Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. 
As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, 
Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, 
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey 
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids 
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs 
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; 
But in his way lights on the barren Plaines 
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive 
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: 
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend 
Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, 
Alone, for other Creature in this place 
Living or liveless to be found was none, 
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth 
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew 
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin 
With vanity had filld the works of men: 
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things 
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, 
Or happiness in this or th' other life; 
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits 
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, 
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find 
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; 
All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, 
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, 
Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 
Till final dissolution, wander here, 
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; 
Those argent Fields more likely habitants, 
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold 
Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: 
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born 
First from the ancient World those Giants came 
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: 
The builders next of Babel on the Plain 
Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe 
New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: 
Others came single; he who to be deemd 
A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, 
Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy 
Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, 
Cleombrotus, and many more too long, 
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers 
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. 
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek 
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; 
And they who to be sure of Paradise 
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, 
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; 
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, 
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs 
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; 
And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems 
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot 
Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe 
A violent cross wind from either Coast 
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry 
Into the devious Air; then might ye see 
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost 
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, 
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, 
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft 
Fly o're the backside of the World farr off 
Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld 
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown 
Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; 
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, 
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame 
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste 
His travell'd steps; farr distant he descries 
Ascending by degrees magnificent 
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, 
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd 
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate 
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold 
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes 
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth 
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. 
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
Angels ascending and descending, bands 
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled 
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, 
Dreaming by night under the open Skie, 
And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. 
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood 
There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes 
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd 
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon 
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, 
Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake 
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. 
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare 
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate 
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. 
Direct against which op'nd from beneath, 
Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, 
A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, 
Wider by farr then that of after-times 
Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, 
Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, 
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, 
On high behests his Angels to and fro 
Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard 
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood 
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land 
Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; 
So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set 
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. 
Satan from hence now on the lower stair 
That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate 
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view 
Of all this World at once.   As when a Scout 
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone 
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne 
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, 
Which to his eye discovers unaware 
The goodly prospect of some forein land 
First-seen, or some renown'd Metropolis 
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, 
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. 
Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, 
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd 
At sight of all this World beheld so faire. 
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood 
So high above the circling Canopie 
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point 
Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears 
Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas 
Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole 
He views in bredth, and without longer pause 
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws 
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease 
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way 
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon 
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, 
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, 
Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, 
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, 
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there 
He stayd not to enquire: above them all 
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven 
Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends 
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe 
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, 
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie 
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, 
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, 
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move 
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute 
Days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing Lamp 
Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd 
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms 
The Univers, and to each inward part 
With gentle penetration, though unseen, 
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: 
So wondrously was set his Station bright. 
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps 
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe 
Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. 
The place he found beyond expression bright, 
Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; 
Not all parts like, but all alike informd 
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; 
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; 
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, 
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon 
In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides 
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, 
That stone, or like to that which here below 
Philosophers in vain so long have sought, 
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde 
Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound 
In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, 
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. 
What wonder then if fields and regions here 
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run 
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch 
Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote 
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt 
Here in the dark so many precious things 
Of colour glorious and effect so rare? 
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met 
Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, 
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, 
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon 
Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now 
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round 
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, 
No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray 
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon 
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, 
The same whom John saw also in the Sun: 
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; 
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar 
Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind 
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings 
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd 
He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. 
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope 
To find who might direct his wandring flight 
To Paradise the happie seat of Man, 
His journies end and our beginning woe. 
But first he casts to change his proper shape, 
Which else might work him danger or delay: 
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, 
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face 
Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb 
Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; 
Under a Coronet his flowing haire 
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore 
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, 
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held 
Before his decent steps a Silver wand. 
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, 
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, 
Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known 
Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n 
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne 
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes 
That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth 
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, 
O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; 

Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand 
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, 
The first art wont his great authentic will 
Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, 
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; 
And here art likeliest by supream decree 
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye 
To visit oft this new Creation round; 
Unspeakable desire to see, and know 
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, 
His chief delight and favour, him for whom 
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, 
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim 
Alone thus wandring.   Brightest Seraph tell 
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man 
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, 
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; 
That I may find him, and with secret gaze, 
Or open admiration him behold 
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd 
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; 
That both in him and all things, as is meet, 
The Universal Maker we may praise; 
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes 
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss 
Created this new happie Race of Men 
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. 

So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; 
For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks 
Invisible, except to God alone, 
By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: 
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps 
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie 
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill 
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd 
Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held 
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; 
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule 
In his uprightness answer thus returnd. 
Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to know 
The works of God, thereby to glorifie 
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess 
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise 
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither 
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, 
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps 
Contented with report hear onely in heav'n: 
For wonderful indeed are all his works, 
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all 
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; 
But what created mind can comprehend 
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite 
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. 
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, 
This worlds material mould, came to a heap: 
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar 
Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; 
Till at his second bidding darkness fled, 
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: 
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then 
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, 
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n 
Flew upward, spirited with various forms, 
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs 
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; 
Each had his place appointed, each his course, 
The rest in circuit walles this Universe. 
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side 
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; 
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light 
His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere 
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon 
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide 
Timely interposes, and her monthly round 
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; 
With borrowd light her countenance triform 
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, 
And in her pale dominion checks the night. 
That spot to which I point is Paradise, 
Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. 
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. 

Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, 
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, 
Where honour due and reverence none neglects, 
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, 
Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, 
Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele, 
Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.

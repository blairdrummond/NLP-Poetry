My mother’s God
has written the best
of the protestant proverbs:
 
you make the bed
you lie in it;
God helps him
 
who helps himself.
He tends to shy away from churches,
is more to be found in
 
phone calls to daughters
or rain clouds over rusty grass.
The Catholics
 
have got him wrong entirely:
too much waving the arms about,
the incense and caftan, that rainbow light.
 
He’s leaner than that,
lean as a pair of
grocer’s scales,
 
hard as a hammer at cattle sales
the third and final
time of asking.
 
His face is most clear
in a scrubbed wooden table
or deep in the shine of a
 
laminex bench.
He’s also observed at weddings and funerals
by strict invitation, not knowing quite
 
which side to sit on.
His second book, my mother says,
is often now too well received;
 
the first is where the centre is,
tooth for claw and eye for tooth
whoever tried the other cheek?
 
Well, Christ maybe,
but that’s another story.
God, like her, by dint of coursework
 
has a further degree in predestination.
Immortal, omniscient, no doubt of that,
he nevertheless keeps regular hours
 
and wipes his feet clean on the mat,
is not to be seen at three in the morning.
His portrait done in a vigorous charcoal
 
is fixed on the inner
curve of her forehead.
Omnipotent there
 
in broad black strokes
he does not move.
It is not easy, she’d confess,
 
to be my mother’s God.

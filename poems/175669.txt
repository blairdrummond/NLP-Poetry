You know our office on the 18th   
floor of the Salmon Tower looks   
      right out on the 

Empire State and it just happened   
we were there finishing up some   
      late invoices on 

a new book that Saturday morning   
when a bomber roared through the   
      mist and crashed 

flames poured from the windows   
into the drifting clouds and sirens   
      screamed down in 

the streets below it was unearthly   
but you know the strangest thing   
      we realized that 

none of us were much surprised be- 
cause we'd always known that those   
      two paragons of 

progress sooner or later would per- 
form before our eyes this demon- 
      stration of their 
      true relationship.

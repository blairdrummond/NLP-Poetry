Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

If I had a hundred dollars to spend, 
    Or maybe a little more, 
I'd hurry as fast as my legs would go 
    Straight to the animal store. 

I wouldn't say, "How much for this or that?" 
    "What kind of a dog is he?" 
I'd buy as many as rolled an eye, 
    Or wagged a tail at me! 

I'd take the hound with the drooping ears 
    That sits by himself alone; 
Cockers and Cairns and wobbly pups 
    For to be my very own. 

I might buy a parrot all red and green, 
    And the monkey I saw before, 
If I had a hundred dollars to spend, 
    Or maybe a little more.

title : Birthday Poem

author : Al Young

text : 
First light of day in Mississippi
 son of laborer & of house wife
 it says so on the official photostat
 not son of fisherman & child fugitive
 from cottonfields & potato patches
 from sugarcane chickens & well-water
 from kerosene lamps & watermelons
 mules named jack or jenny & wagonwheels,
  
 years of meaningless farm work
 work Work WORK WORK WORK—
 “Papa pull you outta school bout March
 to stay on the place & work the crop”
 —her own earliest knowledge
 of human hopelessness & waste
  
 She carried me around nine months
 inside her fifteen year old self
 before here I sit numbering it all
  
 How I got from then to now
 is the mystery that could fill a whole library
 much less an arbitrary stanza
  
 But of course you already know about that
 from your own random suffering
 & sudden inexplicable bliss

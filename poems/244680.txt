If you’re love’s lover and look for love
 cold smoke the dog called bashfulness
 beware for your conversation is a hindrancy
 this poem isn’t interested I’ll bill you
 Why’d the mad one make madness in a thousand works
 that wild one make a thousand wild works of wiles?
 now he disrobes, now he’s so fast
 now he likes intoxicating substances and wants to die
 Since a spider spies and eats a whole deer
 behold what the web of Zoroastrianism will do!
 Since the love of nighties had positive market outlook,
 how will it be with “He took His servant in nighties?”
 Have you not seen the book of Waisa and Ramin?
 Have you not heard the tales of Wamiq and ‘Adra?
 You hike your denim so you don’t wear water
  
 do you have to pull that bridge stunt over & over?
 The way of love is filth and I’m drunk
 the storm storms—how should a storm calm?
 you’ll be the jewel in the ring of lovers
 If you’re insistent on assuming the consequence of jewelry
 so, say it, how does the earth hurt if we fuck?
 what gifts would be unreasonable?
 it’s not cool to beat a drum when yr. in bed, son,
 and put your erection in the middle of the desert
 Listen to the sounds of fucking and coming,
 under the sky, which “Orientals, perhaps owing
 to some optical peculiarity, see as green.”
 When you’re drunk take your clothes off
 Heaven is great, Orion is confused
 how the world is high and killed
 by love which is high and killed!
 When the sun comes out, where do nighties hide?
 When the come comes, where does the pent go?
 I’m done. Speak to me, soul’s soul’s soul
 From desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut

title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 82

author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson

text : 
I wage not any feud with Death 
         For changes wrought on form and face; 
         No lower life that earth's embrace 
May breed with him, can fright my faith. 

Eternal process moving on, 
         From state to state the spirit walks; 
         And these are but the shatter'd stalks, 
Or ruin'd chrysalis of one. 

Nor blame I Death, because he bare 
         The use of virtue out of earth: 
         I know transplanted human worth 
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere. 

For this alone on Death I wreak 
         The wrath that garners in my heart; 
         He put our lives so far apart 
We cannot hear each other speak.

title : The Play of Light and Shadow

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
We want to give ourselves away utterly 
but afterwards we resent it, it is the same 
with the sparrows, their eyes burn so coldly 
under the dusty pines, their small chests swell 
as they dispute a crumb, or the empty place 
where a seed was once: this is our law too, 
to peck and peck at the Self, to take turns 
being I, to die in a fierce sidelong glance, 
then to hold the entire forest in one tilt 
of a tufted head, to take flight suddenly 
and fuck in midair, tumbling upward.

Nice day,
 sweet October afternoon
 Men walk the sun-shot avenues,
                                                      Second, Third, eyes
                                                      intent elsewhere
 ears communing with transistors in shirt pockets
                                     Bars are full, quiet,
 discussion during commercials
                                                       only
 Pirates lead New York 4-1, top of the 6th, 2
 Yankees on base,    1 man out
  
 What a nice day for all this  !
 Handsome women, even
 dreamy jailbait, walk
                                       nearly neglected  :
 men’s eyes are blank
 their thoughts are all in Pittsburgh
  
 Last half of the 9th, the score tied 9-all,
 Mazeroski leads off for the Pirates
 The 2nd pitch he simply, sweetly
                                                            CRACK!
 belts it clean over the left-field wall
  
 Blocks of afternoon
 acres of afternoon
 Pennsylvania Turnpikes of afternoon  .  One
                                     diamond stretches out in the sun
                                                      the 3rd base line
                                     and what men come down
                                     it
  
                                     The final score, 10-9
  
 Yanquis, come home

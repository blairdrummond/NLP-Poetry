title : Bridge & Swimmer

author : Forrest Gander

text : 
Our eye goes past the hieroglyphic tree to the swimmer
 carving a wake in the water. And almost to the railroad bridge
 from which the swimmer might have dived. Then, as though
 come to the end of its tether,
 our gaze returns, pulling toward the blemish
 on the surface of the print. An L-shaped chemical dribble,
 it sabotages the scene’s transparence
 and siphons off its easy appeal.
  
 At the same time, the blemish
 joins together the realms
 of seer and swimmer
 in our experience of plunging
 into and out of the image.

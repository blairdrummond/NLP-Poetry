Miss Bliss, once I thought I was endless
since father was perpetual in his grade school
of seedlings in cups, the overly loved pets, and recess 
while mother was the lipsticked dancing girl 
on the Steel Pier who would outstep Hitler.

I was insufferable when I rolled
the Volkswagen bus two times and lived
with the snow chains like costumed jewels
slung over me and the spare rolled 
away as in a folktale.
The pact I made in the spinning instant 
said in my language of American 
boy, Put up or shut up, to God, 
the State Trooper who was kind 
and spoke of service and punishment 
and giving yourself away.

Now, I’m alive through the agency
of iron and contract work and appeals 
to the fallenangel and dusk
but wet-winged and still without you,
Miss Bliss, who took me inside 
where there was an ocean 
before which we were children. 
That calm, that fear,
that witness of the two-thirds 
of everything else.

title : A Small Motor

author : Alberto Ríos

text : 
The easiest sadness is a boy   
Watching another boy 
Walk with a barefooted girl, clean 

Perfect feet, that kind of nose,   
Eyes like those he’s dreamed   
In the dream that comes back. 

A boy watching another boy lucky   
Gets an ache 
That is a small motor. 

In me there is an animal,   
And in that animal   
There is a hunger. 

I remember the boy   
Watching a boy.   
It was me. 

Watching, I was a little bit   
The boy walking.   
I was both of us. 

That’s how it felt.   
What I could not have,   
That’s what I was 

Inside, an ache   
Coming as I stood   
Too many places.

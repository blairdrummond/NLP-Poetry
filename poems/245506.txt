to Michael Lally
You had your own reasons for getting
 In your own way. You didn’t want to be
 Clear to yourself. You knew a hell
 Of a lot more than you were willing
                  to let yourself know. I felt
 Natural love for you on the spot. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Right.
 Beautiful. I don’t use the word lightly. I
 Protested with whatever love (honesty) (& frontal nudity)
 A yes basically reserved Irish Catholic American Providence Rhode
                  Island New Englander is able to manage. You
 Are sophisticated, not uncomplicated, not
 Naïve, and Not simple. An Entertainer, & I am, too.
 Frank O’Hara respected love, so do you, & so do we.
 He was himself & I was me. And when we came together
 Each ourselves in Iowa, all the way
 That was love, & it still is, love, today. Can you see me
 In what I say? Because as well I see you know
 In what you have to say, I did love Frank, as I do
 You, “in the right way”.
 That’s just talk, not Logos,
                  a getting down to cases:
 I take it as simple particulars that
                  we wear our feelings on our faces.

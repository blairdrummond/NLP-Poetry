title : I Was Sleeping Where the Black Oaks Move

author : Louise Erdrich

text : 
We watched from the house 
as the river grew, helpless 
and terrible in its unfamiliar body.   
Wrestling everything into it, 
the water wrapped around trees 
until their life-hold was broken. 
They went down, one by one, 
and the river dragged off their covering. 

Nests of the herons, roots washed to bones,   
snags of soaked bark on the shoreline:   
a whole forest pulled through the teeth   
of the spillway. Trees surfacing 
singly, where the river poured off 
into arteries for fields below the reservation. 

When at last it was over, the long removal,   
they had all become the same dry wood.   
We walked among them, the branches   
whitening in the raw sun. 
Above us drifted herons, 
alone, hoarse-voiced, broken, 
settling their beaks among the hollows. 
Grandpa said, These are the ghosts of the tree people   
moving among us, unable to take their rest. 
 

Sometimes now, we dream our way back to the heron dance.   
Their long wings are bending the air   
into circles through which they fall.   
They rise again in shifting wheels.   
How long must we live in the broken figures   
their necks make, narrowing the sky.

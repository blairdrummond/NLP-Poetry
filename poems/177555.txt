The surfers beautiful as men 
                                           can be 
ride the warm 
                     blue green 
                                     swells 
and the white sand is alive with girls. 
Outriggers (double boats) ride the waves back in   
as the native warriors did.   
I tried to swim and tried to look,   
but ended up just going back:   
a huge, perfect black 
man at the beach 
somehow drove me away a block   
to St. Augustine’s Church.   
The bodies were giv- 
                              ing me a fit 
and I have come to seek the momentary calm 
we find sometimes in the musk of Christ 
(when he was awake 
                            and sweat- 
ing blood 
               as others slept, 
or like a furious bouncer 
hustling out the money changers).   
The bodies of Mary and Christ 
both still live, we’re told. They’re alive   
and thus 
must have dealt with the stress   
of that long time 
                           of turning on   
to being young. 
I speak of teens. 
                           Fifteen and ten 

years ago when I first confessed, 
it was in this same church built then   
as a gigantic shed 
where the strange Hawaiian birds   
(I forgot their names—no matter)   
flew in and out of the high wood- 
en rafters 
like the whimsical winds of grace,   
and grace gives back to sight   
what beauty is— 
                        as 
that loveliness at the beach. 
Now the church 
                      has been rebuilt   
in pointed stone across the street   
from a much 
                  higher new hotel 
where at lunch 
                      I almost spilled 
and found I could not eat 
the purple orchid in my drink.

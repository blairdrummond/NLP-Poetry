title : To the Reader: If You Asked Me

author : Chase Twichell

text : 
I want you with me, and yet you are the end 
of my privacy. Do you see how these rooms 
have become public? How we glance to see if— 
who? Who did you imagine? 
Surely we’re not here alone, you and I. 

I’ve been wandering 
where the cold tracks of language 
collapse into cinders, unburnable trash. 
Beyond that, all I can see is the remote cold 
of meteors before their avalanches of farewell. 

If you asked me what words 
a voice like this one says in parting, 
I’d say, I’m sweeping an empty factory 
toward which I feel neither hostility nor nostalgia. 
I’m just a broom, sweeping.

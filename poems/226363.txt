title : The Unsung Song of Harry Duffy

author : G. E. Murray

text : 
Pure veins of bogus blue-blood and such fancy hungers 
~ 
In the end no surprise of reports of you dying younger than your gods 
~ 
Kicked back in the classic toilet scene 
~ 
With a spike in your arm and twelve large in pocket 
~ 
Thanks to a lucky day scamming the dumb Social Services folks 
~ 
It’s a human thing, pants at your ankles, leaving unclean 
~ 
Because life’s road is only one night in a bad motel 
~ 
Harry, you could play basketball in your bare feet, and win 
~ 
You could name all the provinces of Canada 
~ 
And simultaneously scour the Social Register 
~ 
For the names of those sad and silly girls you wanted to get right 
~ 
You relished autumn leaves and ignited inglorious schemes 
~ 
Deconstructing the idea of prep-school Friday sunsets 
~ 
In lavish October, stealing among faculty hors d’oeuvres and sherry 
~ 
All the while creating your own hooligan oeuvre 
~ 
With your others off to Yale, Colgate, Brown 
~ 
Night after night, alone in L.A. 
~ 
Seeking better quotas, vistas, cushion, heroin 
~ 
And that last tricky exit to the Santa Monica Freeway 
~ 
In one more borrowed car with one more borrowed fiction 
~ 
Oh yes, you must have been laughing 
~ 
And spitting back at the boldface of Pacific wind 
~ 
Cruising the left coast on sheer gall 
~ 
But mostly, at 3 a.m., in the local playground, Harry 
~ 
You played solitary ball 
~ 
And dreamed of final seconds in a distant game 
~ 
You drove to the sacred bucket with a fury 
~ 
Slick crossover dribble, and then burst to the pull-up jumper 
~ 
No harm, no foul, nothing but net. 
~ 
But all alone, in the heart of West Hollywood, Harry, 
~ 
You jerk, you bricked the last shot.

title : Depression

So proudly she came into the subway car 
all who were not reading their newspapers saw 
the head high and the slow tread— 
coat wrinkled and her belongings in a paper bag, 
face unwashed and the grey hair uncombed; 

simple soul, who so early in the morning when only the 
    poorest go to work, 
stood up in the subway and outshouting the noise: 
“Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I have a baby at home who 
    is sick, 
and I have no money, no job;” who did not have box or cap 
    to take coins— 
only his hands, 
and, seeing only faces turned away, 
did not even go down the aisle as beggars do; 

the fire had burnt through the floor: 
machines and merchandise had fallen into   
the great hole, this zero that had sucked away so many years 
and now, seen at last, the shop itself; 
the ceiling sloped until it almost touched the floor— 
    a strange curve 
in the lines and oblongs of his life; 
drops were falling   
from the naked beams of the floor above, 
from the soaked plaster, still the ceiling; 
drops of dirty water were falling 
on his clothes and hat and on his hands; 
the thoughts of business 
gathered in his bosom like black water 
in footsteps through a swamp; 

waiting for a job, she studied the dusty table at which she sat 
and the floor which had been badly swept— 
the office-boy had left the corners dirty; 
a mouse ran in and out under the radiator 
and she drew her feet away 
and her skirt about her legs, but the mouse went in and out 
about its business; and she sat waiting for a job 
in an unfriendly world of men and mice; 

walking along the drive by twos and threes, 
talking about jobs, 
jobs they might get and jobs they had had, 
never turning to look at the trees or the river 
glistening in the sunlight or the automobiles 
that went swiftly past them— 
in twos and threes talking about jobs; 

in the drizzle 
four in a row 
close to the curb 
that passers-by might pass, 
the squads stand 
waiting for soup, 
a slice of bread 
and shelter— 
grimy clothes 
their uniform; 
on a stoop 
stiffly across the steps 
a man 
who has fainted; 
each in that battalion 
eyes him, 
but does not move from his place, 
well drilled in want.

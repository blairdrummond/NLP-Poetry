title : Faith, Dogma, and Heresy

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
It was Sunday, before dinner. 
My uncles were listening to the opera. 
O.Z. and I carried my brother in 
And laid him on the table. 
The women started screaming. 
My brother raised up on his side 
With dried blood on his hands, 
We killed those goddamn Canale brothers 
And nobody is ever going to touch us! 
The men shut their eyes and danced. 
We drank until morning 
When everything was quiet. 
They wiped their eyes, kissed us goodbye and left.

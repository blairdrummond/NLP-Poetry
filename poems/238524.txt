would be coming back 
from some war, sending 
back stuffed birds or 
handkerchiefs in navy 
blue with Love painted  
on it. Some sent telegrams 
for birthdays, the pastel 
letters like jewels. The  
magazines were full of fathers who 
were doing what had 
to be done, were serving,  
were brave. Someone 
yelped there’d be confetti 
in the streets, maybe 
no school. That soon 
we’d have bananas. My 
father sat in the grey 
chair, war after war, 
hardly said a word. I 
wished he had gone 
away with the others 
so maybe he would 
be coming back to us

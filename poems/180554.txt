In the seam between day and night, wind 
                   ruts the dirt road and   
ruffles the milky way of dandelions. 

The young among them are greasy gold and urgent, 
                   while the old are balanced   
between growth and that burst past   

growing—annihilation, culmination   
                   of a beginning each has always been   
ending toward, admitting more and more   

space, until what's left is   
                   beyond color, a bleary truss 
of matter and air. Shocked   

accomplice of the rounding light,   
                   how you tremble in the stretch   
of your death, which is like all deaths,   

geometric with seed. Wind-swimmer, 
                   eye-floater, white nightgowned grandmother   
dancing your platelets on the head of this pin, 

can you show me how to wish,   
                   how to gather and scatter   
this single hooped breath?

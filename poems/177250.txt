title : Meeting the Mountains

author : Gary Snyder

text : 
He crawls to the edge of the foaming creek   
He backs up the slab ledge 
He puts a finger in the water 
He turns to a trapped pool 
Puts both hands in the water 
Puts one foot in the pool 
Drops pebbles in the pool 
He slaps the water surface with both hands   
He cries out, rises up and stands 
Facing toward the torrent and the mountain   
Raises up both hands and shouts three times! 


VI 69, Kai at Sawmill Lake

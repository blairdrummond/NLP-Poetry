Debasement is the password of the base, 
Nobility the epitaph of the noble. 
See how the gilded sky is covered 
With the drifting twisted shadows of the dead. 

The Ice Age is over now, 
Why is there ice everywhere? 
The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered, 
Why do a thousand sails contest the Dead Sea? 

I came into this world 
Bringing only paper, rope, a shadow, 
To proclaim before the judgment 
The voice that has been judged: 

Let me tell you, world, 
I—do—not—believe! 
If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet, 
Count me as number thousand and one. 

I don't believe the sky is blue; 
I don't believe in thunder's echoes; 
I don't believe that dreams are false; 
I don't believe that death has no revenge. 

If the sea is destined to breach the dikes 
Let all the brackish water pour into my heart; 
If the land is destined to rise 
Let humanity choose a peak for existence again. 

A new conjunction and glimmering stars 
Adorn the unobstructed sky now; 
They are the pictographs from five thousand years. 
They are the watchful eyes of future generations.

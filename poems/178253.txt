There is little I can do 
besides stoop to pluck them 
one by one from the ground, 
their roots all weak links, 
this hoard of Lazaruses popping up 
at night, not the Heavenly Blue 
so like silk handkerchiefs, 
nor the Giant White so timid 
in the face of the moon, 
but poor relations who visit 
then stay. They sleep in my garden. 
Each morning I evict them. 
Each night more arrive, their leaves 
small, green shrouds, 
reminding me the mother root 
waits deep underground 
and I dig but will never find her 
and her children will inherit 
all that Iâ€™ve cleared 
when she holds me tighter 
and tighter in her arms.

title : Empty Pitchforks

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
“There was poverty before money.”
There was debtors’ prison before inmates,   
there was hunger prefossil, 

there was pain before a nervous system   
to convey it to the brain, there existed 

poverty before intelligence, or accountants,   
before narration; there was bankruptcy aswirl 

in nowhere, it was palpable 
where nothing was palpable, there was repossession 

in the gasses forming so many billion ... ; 
there was poverty—it had a tongue—in cooling 

ash, in marl, and coming loam, 
thirst in the few strands of hay slipping 

between a pitchfork’s wide tines,   
in the reptile and the first birds, 

poverty aloof and no mystery like God   
its maker; there was surely want 

in one steamed and sagging onion,   
there was poverty in the shard of bread 

sopped in the final drop of gravy 
you snatched from your brother’s mouth.

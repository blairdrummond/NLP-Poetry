title : A Woman's Looks

text : 
    A woman’s looks
    Are barbed hooks,
    That catch by art
    The strongest heart,
When yet they spend no breath.
    But let them speak,
    And sighing break
    Forth into tears,
    Their words are spears
That wound our souls to death.
    The rarest wit
    Is made forget,
    And like a child
    Is oft beguiled
With Love’s sweet-seeming bait.
    Love with his rod
    So like a god
    Commands the mind
    We cannot find,
Fair shows hide foul deceit.
    Time, that all things
    In order brings,
    Hath taught me now
    To be more slow
In giving faith to speech:
    Since women’s words
    No truth affords,
    And when they kiss
    They think by this
Us men to overreach.

title : You and your whole race.

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
You and your whole race. 
Look down upon the town in which you live 
And be ashamed. 
Look down upon white folks   
And upon yourselves   
And be ashamed 
That such supine poverty exists there, 
That such stupid ignorance breeds children there 
Behind such humble shelters of despair— 
That you yourselves have not the sense to care 
Nor the manhood to stand up and say 
I dare you to come one step nearer, evil world, 
With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat, I dare you to come one step nearer me: 
                        When you can say that 
                        you will be free!

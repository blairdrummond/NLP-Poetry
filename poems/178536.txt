title : corydon & alexis, redux

author : D. A. Powell

text : 
and yet we think that song outlasts us all: wrecked devotion 
the wept face of desire, a kind of   savage caring that reseeds itself 
      and grows in clusters 

oh, you who are young, consider how quickly the body deranges itself 
how time, the cruel banker, forecloses us to snowdrifts white 
      as god’s own ribs 


what else but to linger in the slight shade of those sapling branches 
yearning for that vernal beau.   for don’t birds covet the seeds of the 
      honey locust 
and doesn’t the ewe have a nose for wet filaree and slender oats 
      foraged in the meadow 
kit foxes crave the blacktailed hare: how this longing grabs me 
      by the nape 


guess I figured to be done with desire, if   I could write it out 
dispense with any evidence, the way one burns a pile of   twigs 
      and brush 

what was his name?   I’d ask myself, that guy with the sideburns 
      and charming smile 
the one I hoped that, as from a sip of   hemlock, I’d expire with him 
      on my tongue 


silly poet, silly man: thought I could master nature like a misguided 
      preacher 
as if   banishing love is a fix.   as if the stars go out when we shut our 
      sleepy eyes

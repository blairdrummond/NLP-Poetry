title : September Tomatoes

The whiskey stink of rot has settled
 in the garden, and a burst of fruit flies rises 
when I touch the dying tomato plants. 

 Still, the claws of tiny yellow blossoms
 flail in the air as I pull the vines up by the roots 
and toss them in the compost. 

 It feels cruel. Something in me isn’t ready
 to let go of summer so easily. To destroy
 what I’ve carefully cultivated all these months. 
Those pale flowers might still have time to fruit. 

 My great-grandmother sang with the girls of her village 
as they pulled the flax. Songs so old
 and so tied to the season that the very sound
 seemed to turn the weather.

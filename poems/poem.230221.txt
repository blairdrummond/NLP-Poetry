Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

This year an ocean trip I took, and as I am a Scot 
And like to get my money's worth I never missed a meal. 
In spite of Neptune's nastiness I ate an awful lot, 
Yet felt as fit as if we sailed upon an even keel. 
But now that I am home again I'm stricken with disgust; 
How many pounds of fat I've gained I'd rather not divulge: 
Well, anyway, I mean to take this tummy down or bust, 
So here I'm suet-strafing in the 
                                                      Battle of the Bulge. 

No more will sausage, bacon, eggs provide my breakfast fare; 
On lobster I will never lunch, with mounds of mayonnaise. 
At tea I'll Spartanly eschew the chocolate eclair; 
Roast duckling and peche melba shall not consummate my days. 
No more nocturnal ice-box raids, midnight spaghetti feeds; 
On slabs of pate de foie gras I vow I won't indulge: 
Let bran and cottage cheese suffice my gastronomic needs, 
And lettuce be my ally in the 
                                                      Battle of the Bulge. 

To hell with you, ignoble paunch, abhorrent in my sight! 
I gaze at your rotundity, and savage is my frown. 
I'll rub you and I'll scrub you and I'll drub you day and night, 
But by the gods of symmetry I swear I'll get you down. 
Your smooth and smug convexity, by heck! I will subdue, 
And when you tucker in again with joy will I refulge; 
No longer of my toes will you obstruct my downward view ... 
With might and main I'll fight to gain the 
                                                      Battle of the Bulge.

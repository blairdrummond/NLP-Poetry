title : The Abdominal Exam

author : Rafael Campo

Before the glimmer of his sunken eyes,
 What question could I answer with my lies?
  
 Digesting everything, it’s all so plain
 In him, his abdomen so thin the pain
  
 Is almost visible. I probe the lump
 His boyfriend noticed first, my left hand limp
  
 Beneath the pressure of the right. With AIDS
 You have to think lymphoma—swollen nodes,
  
 A tender spleen, the liver’s jutting edge—
 It strikes me suddenly I will oblige 
  
 This hunger that announces death is near,
 And as I touch him, cold and cavalier,
  
 The language of beneath the diaphragm
 Has told me where it’s coming from
  
 And where I’m going, too: soft skin to rocks,
 The body reveling until it wrecks
  
 Against the same internal, hidden shoal,
 The treasures we can’t hide, our swallowed gold.

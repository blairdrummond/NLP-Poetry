The Glass Bubbles

Modern
U.S., Mid-Atlantic
Nature, Seas, Rivers, & Streams



The motion of gathering loops of water
 Must either burst or remain in a moment.
 The violet colors through the glass
 Throw up little swellings that appear
 And spatter as soon as another strikes
 And is born; so pure are they of colored
 Hues, that we feel the absent strength
 Of its power. When they begin they gather
 Like sand on the beach: each bubble
 Contains a complete eye of water.

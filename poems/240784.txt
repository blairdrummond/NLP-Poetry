When I came to my motherâ€™s house 
the day after she had died 
it was already a museum of her 
unfinished gestures. The mysteries 
from the public library, due
in two weeks. The half-eaten square 
of lasagna in the fridge.

The half-burned wreckage 
of her last cigarette, 
and one red swallow 
of wine in a lipsticked 
glass beside her chair.

Finally, a blue Bic 
on a couple of downs 
and acrosses left blank 
in the Sunday crossword, 
which actually had the audacity 
to look a little smug 
at having, for once, won.

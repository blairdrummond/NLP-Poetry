title : The semantics of flowers on Memorial Day

author : Bob Hicok

text : 
Historians will tell you my uncle 
wouldn't have called it World War II 
or the Great War plus One or Tombstone 

over My Head. All of this language 
came later. He and his buddies 
knew it as get my ass outta here 

or fucking trench foot and of course 
sex please now. Petunias are an apology 
for ignorance, my confidence 

that saying high-density bombing 
or chunks of brain in cold coffee 
even suggests the athleticism 

of his flinch or how casually 
he picked the pieces out. 
Geraniums symbolize the secrets 

life kept from him, the wonder 
of variable-speed drill and how 
the sky would have changed had he lived 

to shout it’s a girl. My hands 
enter dirt easily, a premonition. 
I sit back on my uncle’s stomach 

exactly like I never did, he was 
a picture to me, was my father 
looking across a field at wheat 

laying down to wind. For a while, 
Tyrants’ War and War of World Freedom 
and Anti-Nazi War skirmished 

for linguistic domination. If 
my uncle called it anything 
but too many holes in too many bodies 

no flower can say. I plant marigolds 
because they came cheap and who knows 
what the earth’s in the mood to eat.

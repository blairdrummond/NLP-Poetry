No one knew what the stones like squatting frogs
 signified. There they were, fuming in rows, out
 of the ground; every critic had his explanation
 or hers. But—we had to remember—they 
  
 came to nothing, every one; those large stones
 out of the earth served the systems
 of those who considered them, as explaining
 something about the past it was important
  
 for the explainer to explain. And yet
 no one had any idea truly; there was no
 basis in fact for any view of them, and
 they remained like their origins—or like
  
 smiling Olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures
 come from the earth to reproach us, almost
 cheerfully, for our ignorance—a mystery, just
 as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing.

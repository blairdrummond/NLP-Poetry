Sonnet

From child to youth; from youth to arduous man;
         From lethargy to fever of the heart;
         From faithful life to dream-dower'd days apart;
From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;?
Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran
         Till now. Alas, the soul!?how soon must she
         Accept her primal immortality,?
The flesh resume its dust whence it began?

O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!
         O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,
         Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:
That when the peace is garner'd in from strife,
         The work retriev'd, the will regenerate,
         This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!

Great Alexander sailing was from his true course turned
 By a young wind from a cloud in Asia moving
 Like a most recognizable most silvery woman;
 Tall Alexander to the island came.
 The small breeze blew behind his turning head.
 He walked the foam of ripples into this scene.
  
 The trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk
 Until you look again.     Then people and animals
 Are ripening on the branches;     the broad leaves
 Are leaves;     pale horses, sharp fine foxes
 Blossom;     the red rabbit falls
 Ready and running.     The trunk coils, turns,
 Snakes, fishes.     Now the ripe people fall and run,
 Three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand
 Where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.
  
 Stiff Alexander stands.     He cannot turn.
 But he is free to turn : this is the speaking tree,
 It calls your name.     It tells us what we mean.

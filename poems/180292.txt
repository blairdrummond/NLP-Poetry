title : Far Away, Far Away . . .

author : Franco Fortini

text : 
Far away, far away, men making wars. 
Other folk's blood spilt on other folk's floors. 

Only this morning I wounded my finger: 
a thorn on my rosebush pierced like a stinger. 

Sucking that finger, I thought of the war. 
Sad is the earth! And those people, so poor! 

I'm of no help, being here and not there, 
nor can I reach them, by sea or by air. 

And what if I couldâ€”what good could I do? 
My Arabic's terrible! My English is, too! 

What, should I stroll through the fields of the dead 
leaving sheaves of my verses under each head? 

No. Enough of this wretched irony-fest. 
Let's put on a coat. The sun's low in the west.

title : They are hostile nations

author : Margaret Atwood

i 

In view of the fading animals 
the proliferation of sewers and fears   
the sea clogging, the air 
nearing extinction 

we should be kind, we should 
take warning, we should forgive each other 

Instead we are opposite, we   
touch as though attacking, 

the gifts we bring 
even in good faith maybe   
warp in our hands to 
implements, to manoeuvres 


ii 

Put down the target of me 
you guard inside your binoculars,   
in turn I will surrender 

this aerial photograph   
(your vulnerable 
sections marked in red)   
I have found so useful 

See, we are alone in 
the dormant field, the snow 
that cannot be eaten or captured 


iii 

Here there are no armies   
here there is no money 

It is cold and getting colder, 

We need each others’ 
breathing, warmth, surviving   
is the only war 
we can afford, stay 

walking with me, there is almost   
time / if we can only   
make it as far as 

the (possibly) last summer

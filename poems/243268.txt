What god will catch me
 when I’m down, when I’ve taken
 sufficient drink to reveal
 myself, when my words are little
 more than a blurring
 of consonant and vowel?
  
 I’m drunk on spring:
 branches of waxy leaves that
 greet me at my driveway,
 a family clutching
 trays of sweets.
 How can I sing of this?
  
 If I cannot sing, then
 make me mute. Or lend me
 words, send me
 the taste of another’s prayer,
 cool as a coin
 newly minted on the tongue.

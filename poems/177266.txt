title : Street Musicians

author : John Ashbery

text : 
One died, and the soul was wrenched out   
Of the other in life, who, walking the streets   
Wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on   
The same corners, volumetrics, shadows   
Under trees. Farther than anyone was ever   
Called, through increasingly suburban airs   
And ways, with autumn falling over everything:   
The plush leaves the chattels in barrels   
Of an obscure family being evicted 
Into the way it was, and is. The other beached   
Glimpses of what the other was up to: 
Revelations at last. So they grew to hate and forget each other. 

So I cradle this average violin that knows   
Only forgotten showtunes, but argues 
The possibility of free declamation anchored 
To a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself   
In November, with the spaces among the days   
More literal, the meat more visible on the bone.   
Our question of a place of origin hangs 
Like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests, 
In coves with the water always seeping up, and left   
Our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared   
On the landscape, to make of us what we could.

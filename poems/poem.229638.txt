Rhymed Stanza

Thou sorrow, venom Elfe: 
      Is this thy play, 
To spin a web out of thyselfe 
      To Catch a Fly? 
            For Why? 

I saw a pettish wasp 
      Fall foule therein: 
Whom yet thy Whorle pins did not clasp 
      Lest he should fling 
            His sting. 

But as affraid, remote 
      Didst stand hereat, 
And with thy little fingers stroke 
      And gently tap 
            His back. 

Thus gently him didst treate 
      Lest he should pet, 
And in a froppish, aspish heate 
      Should greatly fret 
            Thy net. 

Whereas the silly Fly, 
      Caught by its leg 
Thou by the throate tookst hastily 
      And 'hinde the head 
            Bite Dead. 

This goes to pot, that not 
      Nature doth call. 
Strive not above what strength hath got, 
      Lest in the brawle 
            Thou fall. 

This Frey seems thus to us. 
      Hells Spider gets 
His intrails spun to whip Cords thus 
      And wove to nets 
            And sets. 

To tangle Adams race 
      In's stratigems 
To their Destructions, spoil'd, made base 
      By venom things, 
            Damn'd Sins. 

But mighty, Gracious Lord 
      Communicate 
Thy Grace to breake the Cord, afford 
      Us Glorys Gate 
            And State. 

We'l Nightingaile sing like 
      When pearcht on high 
In Glories Cage, thy glory, bright, 
      And thankfully, 
            For joy.

They pay us time and a half   
and don’t dare catch us 
drinking: we don’t insist, 
don’t pass a bottle, but each sips   
a private pint, all sitting 
in the narrow room with our backs   
to the center, each facing 
his work—router, stain tray,   
buffing wheel, drill press— 
and with that sweet taste echoing   
in our bones, we watch our hands   
make what they always made   
—rosewood handles—but now   
we smile in delighted surprise   
and Marchesi brings envelopes   
that record a full day’s work   
though it’s still noon, 
processions still fill the streets,   
choirs, loudspeakers bellowing   
Hallelujah: and we change 
into our finest clothes in the locker room,   
admiring each other’s hat brims, passing bottles   
freely until all are empty, and at last   
we separate in the brilliant street, each   
in the direction of a different tolling bell.

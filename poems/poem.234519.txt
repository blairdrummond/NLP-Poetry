Miracles Attending Israel's Journey
When Isr'el, freed from Pharaoh's hand, 
Left the proud tyrant and his land, 
The tribes with cheerful homage own 
Their king; and Judah was his throne. 

Across the deep their journey lay; 
The deep divides to make them way. 
Jordan beheld their march, and led, 
With backward current, to his head. 

The mountains shook like frighted sheep, 
Like lambs the little hillocks leap; 
Not Sinai on her base could stand, 
Conscious of sov'reign pow'r at hand. 

What pow'r could make the deep divide? 
Make Jordan backward roll his tide? 
Why did ye leap, ye little hills? 
And whence the fright that Sinai feels? 

Let ev'ry mountain, ev'ry flood, 
Retire and know th' approaching God, 
The King of Isr'el: see him here! 
Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear. 

He thunders, and all nature mourns; 
The rock to standing pools he turns, 
Flints spring with fountains at his word, 
And fires and seas confess the Lord.

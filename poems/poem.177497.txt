Why can pansies be their aid or paths.   
He said paths she had said paths 
All like to do their best with half of the time   
A sweeter sweetener came and came in time   
Tell him what happened then only to go 
He nervous as you add only not only as they angry were   
Be kind to half the time that they shall say 
It is undoubtedly of them for them for every one any one   
They thought quietly that Sunday any day she might not come 
In half a way of coining that they wish it 
Let it be only known as please which they can underrate   
They try once to destroy once to destroy as often 
Better have it changed to pigeons now if the room smokes   
Not only if it does but happens to happens to have the room smoke all the time. 
In their way not in their way it can be all arranged 
Not now we are waiting. 
I have read that they wish if land is there   
Land is there if they wish land is there   
Yes hardly if they wish land is there 
It is no thought of enterprise there trying   
Might they claim as well as reclaim.   
Did she mean that she had nothing.   
We say he and I that we do not cry 
Because we have just seen him and called him back 
He meant to go away 
Once now I will tell all which they tell lightly. 
How were we when we met. 
All of which nobody not we know   
But it is so. They cannot be allied 
They can be close and chosen.   
Once in a while they wait. 
He likes it that there is no chance to misunderstand pansies.

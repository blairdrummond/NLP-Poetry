title : Winter Journal: Disseminate Birds over Water

text : 
The reservoir churned and cloud-deformed 
The far line of hills, fused, bunched color 
bitter wind against this hunch 
my folded bones 
I can see the rust earth beneath trees, the rough mats 
       gathering weight in semi-darkness, dim 
       nesting bases of trees 
Graft of dark cloud upon lighter one behind, building up 
       of something, a thickening, deposit of cold air, dark web 
       of insistence, built up in me 
How long can it be here? 
A simmering of trees, a dark moiling 
       a winter weight 
       a mid-shimmering of heat-distorted things 
The positioning of bolts of deep orange, gold-green and amber 
       molded, wicked in together 
Drops in pressure, now, a field of cold, a shift 
       between rain and snow 
The movement into this remembering 
       of separate things, train sounding its horn, removing 
       itself from the scene 
Snow thickening the far bars of trees, graying them in 
Blotting, dulling, gauzing over this dream 
It is snowfalling, it is beauty-filling and cleansing 
       this burn of words 
       it is delivering something seeming to uplift and to begin 
       pressing downward, this ink into frozen droplet 
       this thing 

Snow plinking in the leaves, the left hands of trees 
       the neat levers and pulls 
       the odd weeds 
The rich fringe of emptying trees 
       the shifted pins 
the breaks into dense pines into period reeds into gutterings 
What happens to the opposite shore 
       is untenable 
       is unmanageable to me 
That stratagem of damage, that unmattering 
Believe me it is some abomination of things being killed and 
       that mattering to me 
That exquisite built thing that is obliterated 
       its tiny white amplitude, its singing crushed into 
       particles, its must on the undersides of leaves 
Now I am sure 
       the world has not unfolded before me 
       anymore but has closed into rows 
       of its foldings 
Something in the collections of those trees 
       bare branches upthrust, the brush of them 
       bare branches up-brushed 
       their lip along mesh of shore weeds, the flanged grasses 
       the scrim of their midst 
       I am in them again 
       meddling in darks that are in them 
       and the white gold that is their outermost 
       screen that is their leafleting their grief that is in me 
       thin dredge of pebbles and 
       strange glandular patternings of trees 
       against trees against cut-bank against breath 

The rubied lung of sumac 
       tragedian

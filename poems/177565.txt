title : I Wave Good-bye When Butter Flies

I wave good-bye when butter flies 
and cheer a boxing match, 
I've often watched my pillow fight, 
I've sewn a cabbage patch, 
I like to dance at basket balls 
or lead a rubber band, 
I've marvelled at a spelling bee, 
I've helped a peanut stand. 

It's possible a pencil points, 
but does a lemon drop? 
Does coffee break or chocolate kiss, 
and will a soda pop? 
I share my milk with drinking straws, 
my meals with chewing gum, 
and should I see my pocket change, 
I'll hear my kettle drum. 

It makes me sad when lettuce leaves, 
I laugh when dinner rolls, 
I wonder if the kitchen sinks 
and if a salad bowls, 
I've listened to a diamond ring, 
I've waved a football fan, 
and if a chimney sweeps the floor, 
I'm sure the garbage can.

How little we know,   
and when we know it! 

It was prettily said that “No man 
hath an abundance of cows on the plain, nor shards 
in his cupboard.” Wait! I think I know who said that! It was . . . 

Never mind, dears, the afternoon 
will fold you up, along with preoccupations   
that now seem so important, until only a child   
running around on a unicycle occupies center stage.   
Then what will you make of walls? And I fear you   
will have to come up with something, 

be it a terraced gambit above the sea 
or gossip overheard in the marketplace. 
For you see, it becomes you to be chastened: 
for the old to envy the young, 
and for youth to fear not getting older, 
where the paths through the elms, the carnivals, begin. 

And it was said of Gyges that his ring 
attracted those who saw him not, 
just as those who wandered through him were aware 
only of a certain stillness, such as precedes an earache, 
while lumberjacks in headbands came down to see what all the fuss was about, 
whether it was something they could be part of 
sans affront to self-esteem. 
And those temple hyenas who had seen enough, 
nostrils aflare, fur backing up in the breeze, 
were no place you could count on, 
having taken a proverbial powder 
as rifle butts received another notch. 
I, meanwhile . . . I was going to say I had squandered spring   
when summer came along and took it from me   
like a terrier a lady has asked one to hold for a moment 
while she adjusts her stocking in the mirror of a weighing machine.   
But here it is winter, and wrong 
to speak of other seasons as though they exist.   
Time has only an agenda 
in the wallet at his back, while we 
who think we know where we are going unfazed 
end up in brilliant woods, nourished more than we can know 
by the unexpectedness of ice and stars 
and crackling tears. We’ll just have to make a go of it, 
a run for it. And should the smell of baking cookies appease 
one or the other of the olfactory senses, climb down   
into this wagonload of prisoners. 

The meter will be screamingly clear then, 
the rhythms unbounced, for though we came 
to life as to a school, we must leave it without graduating   
even as an ominous wind puffs out the sails 
of proud feluccas who don’t know where they’re headed,   
only that a motion is etched there, shaking to be free.

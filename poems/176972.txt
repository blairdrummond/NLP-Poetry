author : David St. John

text : 
They were sitting on the thin mattress 
He’d once rolled & carried up the four floors   
To his room only to find it covered nearly all   
Of the bare wood 
Leaving just a small path alongside the wall 

& between them was the sack 
Of oranges & pears she’d brought its neck   
Turned back to expose the colors of the fruit 
& as she opened a bottle of wine 
He reached over to a tall stack of books 
& pulled out The Tao & with a silly flourish   
Handed it across the bed to her   she looked up   
& simply poured the two squat water glasses   
Half-full with wine & then she 
Took the book   reading silently   not aloud   
As he’d assumed & suddenly he felt clearly   
She knew the way 
Two people must come upon such an understanding   
Together of course but separately 
As the moon & the wave remain individually one

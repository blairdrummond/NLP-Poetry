author : Louise Glück

text : 
I said you could snuggle. That doesn’t mean 
your cold feet all over my dick. 

Someone should teach you how to act in bed. 
What I think is you should 
keep your extremities to yourself. 

Look what you did— 
you made the cat move. 

            But I didn’t want your hand there. 
            I wanted your hand here. 

            You should pay attention to my feet. 
            You should picture them 
            the next time you see a hot fifteen year old. 
            Because there’s a lot more where those feet come from.

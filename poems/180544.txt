title : The Late Worm

author : Kay Ryan

text : 
The worms 
which had been 
thick are thin 
upon the ground 
now that it's gotten 
later. They stick 
against the path, 
their pink chapped 
and their inching 
labored. It's a   
matter of moisture 
isn't it? Time, a   
measure of wet, 
shrinking, the 
drier you get.

title : A Winter Daybreak above Vence

The night’s drifts 
Pile up below me and behind my back, 
Slide down the hill, rise again, and build 
Eerie little dunes on the roof of the house.   
In the valley below me, 
Miles between me and the town of St.-Jeannet,   
The road lamps glow. 
They are so cold, they might as well be dark.   
Trucks and cars 
Cough and drone down there between the golden   
Coffins of greenhouses, the startled squawk   
Of a rooster claws heavily across 
A grove, and drowns. 
The gumming snarl of some grouchy dog sounds,   
And a man bitterly shifts his broken gears.   
True night still hangs on, 
Mist cluttered with a racket of its own. 

Now on the mountainside, 
A little way downhill among turning rocks, 
A square takes form in the side of a dim wall.   
I hear a bucket rattle or something, tinny,   
No other stirring behind the dim face 
Of the goatherd’s house. I imagine 
His goats are still sleeping, dreaming 
Of the fresh roses 
Beyond the walls of the greenhouse below them   
And of lettuce leaves opening in Tunisia. 

I turn, and somehow 
Impossibly hovering in the air over everything, 
The Mediterranean, nearer to the moon 
Than this mountain is,   
Shines. A voice clearly 
Tells me to snap out of it. Galway 
Mutters out of the house and up the stone stairs 
To start the motor. The moon and the stars 
Suddenly flicker out, and the whole mountain   
Appears, pale as a shell. 

Look, the sea has not fallen and broken   
Our heads. How can I feel so warm   
Here in the dead center of January? I can   
Scarcely believe it, and yet I have to, this is   
The only life I have. I get up from the stone.   
My body mumbles something unseemly 
And follows me. Now we are all sitting here strangely   
On top of the sunlight.

title : The Hush of the Very Good

You can tell by how he lists 
                                          to let her
kiss him, that the getting, as he gets it,
is good. 
             It’s good in the sweetly salty,
deeply thirsty way that a sea-fogged
rain is good after a summer-long bout
of inland drought. 
                            And you know it
when you see it, don’t you? How it
drenches what’s dry, how the having 
of it quenches. 
                        There is a grassy inlet 
where your ocean meets your land, a slip
that needs a certain kind of vessel,
                                                      and
when that shapely skiff skims in at last,
trimmed bright, mast lightly flagging 
left and right, 
                      then the long, lush reeds 
of your longing part, and soft against 
the hull of that bent wood almost im-
perceptibly brushes a luscious hush 
the heart heeds helplessly—
                                          the hush 
of the very good.

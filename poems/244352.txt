Drawn in outer space
                             on a ceiling of night,
                                                         a hinged balance held true.
  
  
 That balance
                             —its mechanisms
                                                         worked into the unknown—
  
  
 emerged
                             in the star systems
                                                         which turn in union
  
  
 without history
                             as we know it
                                                         on this planet.
  
  
 I recognize it
                             to the East
                                                         said I to the West,
  
  
 not made,
                             not given,
                                                         over the world.
  
  
 Devoted observers,
                             it seems to me
                                                         a just structure.
  
  
 John 1:5 
                             And my search
                                                         for peace underground
  
  
 now come to an end
                             —constraints accepted
                                                         in spirit as well as in letter,
  
  
 the line spent,
                             the theatres in abandon—
                                                         I viewed the balances
  
  
 more clearly than ever before.

title : Shamanism 101

text : 
Like everyone, I wanted my animal   
to be the hawk. 

I thought I wanted the strength   
to eat the eyes first then tear   
into the fuse box of the chest   
and soar away. 

I needed help because I still 
cowered under the shadow of my father,   
a man who inspected picture tubes   
five out of seven nights, 

who woke to breakfast on burnt roast   
except the two weeks he’d sleep   
on a Jersey beach and throw me   
into the gasoline-sheened waves.   
I loved him dying indebted 
not knowing to what, 

thinking his pension would be enough,   
released not knowing from what,   
gumming at something I was afraid   
to get close enough to hear, afraid   
of what I was co-signing. So maybe 
the elephant. The elephant knows 
when one of its own is suffering 
up to six miles away. Charges across   
the desert cognizant of the futility. 
How can I be forgiven when I don’t know   
what I need forgiving for? Sometimes 

the urges are too extreme: to slap 
on the brakes and scream, to bite the haunch   
of some passing perfume, so maybe my animal   
is the tiger. Or shark. 

Or centipede. 

But I know I’m smaller than that,   
filling notebooks with clumsy versions   
of one plaint, one pheromonal call, 

clamoring over a crumb that I think   
is the world, baffled by the splotch   
of one of my own crushed kind, 
almost sweet, a sort of tar, 
following a trail of one or two molecules, 

leaving a trail 
of one or two molecules.

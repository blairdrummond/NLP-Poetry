People who have no children can be hard: 
Attain a mail of ice and insolence: 
Need not pause in the fire, and in no sense 
Hesitate in the hurricane to guard. 
And when wide world is bitten and bewarred 
They perish purely, waving their spirits hence 
Without a trace of grace or of offense 
To laugh or fail, diffident, wonder-starred. 
While through a throttling dark we others hear 
The little lifting helplessness, the queer 
Whimper-whine; whose unridiculous 
Lost softness softly makes a trap for us. 
And makes a curse. And makes a sugar of 
The malocclusions, the inconditions of love.

What shall I give my children? who are poor, 
Who are adjudged the leastwise of the land, 
Who are my sweetest lepers, who demand 
No velvet and no velvety velour; 
But who have begged me for a brisk contour, 
Crying that they are quasi, contraband 
Because unfinished, graven by a hand 
Less than angelic, admirable or sure. 
My hand is stuffed with mode, design, device. 
But I lack access to my proper stone. 
And plenitude of plan shall not suffice 
Nor grief nor love shall be enough alone 
To ratify my little halves who bear 
Across an autumn freezing everywhere.

And shall I prime my children, pray, to pray? 
Mites, come invade most frugal vestibules 
Spectered with crusts of penitentsâ€™ renewals 
And all hysterics arrogant for a day. 
Instruct yourselves here is no devil to pay. 
Children, confine your lights in jellied rules; 
Resemble graves; be metaphysical mules. 
Learn Lord will not distort nor leave the fray. 
Behind the scurryings of your neat motif 
I shall wait, if you wish: revise the psalm 
If that should frighten you: sew up belief 
If that should tear: turn, singularly calm 
At forehead and at fingers rather wise, 
Holding the bandage ready for your eyes.

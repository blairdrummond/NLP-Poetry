Common Measure

I gave my thoughts a golden peach, 
A silver citron tree; 
They clustered dumbly out of reach 
And would not sing for me. 

I built my thoughts a roof of rush, 
A little byre beside; 
They left my music to the thrush 
And flew at eveningtide. 

I went my way and would not care 
If they should come and go; 
A thousand birds seemed up in air, 
My thoughts were singing so.

title : The Lonely Pipefish

author : Barbara Howes

text : 
Up, up, slender   
         As an eel’s 
         Child, weaving   
Through water, our lonely   
Pipefish seeks out his dinner, 

         Scanty at best; he blinks 
         Cut-diamond eyes—snap—he   
         Grabs morsels so small 
Only a lens pinpoints them, 
But he ranges all over 

         That plastic preserve—dorsal   
         Fin tremulous—snap—and   
         Another çedilla 
Of brine shrimp’s gone ... 
We talk on of poetry, of love, 

         Of grammar; he looks   
         At a living comma—   
         Snap—sizzling about 
In his two-gallon Caribbean 
And grazes on umlauts for breakfast. 

         His pug nosed, yellow 
         Mate, aproned in gloom,   
         Fed rarely, slumped, 
Went deadwhite, as we argued on;   
That rudder fin, round as a 

         Pizza cutter, at the 
         End of his two inch 
         Fluent stick self, lets his eyes 
Pilot his mouth—snap ... 
Does his kind remember? Can our kind forget?

title : Season of Quite

author : Roddy Lumsden

With refreshments and some modesty and home-drawn maps, 
the ladies of the parish are marshaling the plans in hand, 
devising the occasions, in softest pencil: the Day of Hearsay, 
Leeway Week, the Maybe Pageant, a hustings on the word   
nearby. Half-promised rain roosts in some clouds a mile out, 
gradual weather making gradual notes on the green, the well, 
the monument, the mayor's yard where dogs purr on elastic. 

Everything taken by the smooth handle then, or about to be, 
hiatus sharp in humble fashion. A small boy spins one wheel 
of an upturned bike, the pond rises, full of skimmed stones 
on somehow days, not Spring, not Summer yet. Engagements 
are announced in the Chronicle, a nine-yard putt falls short. 
Dark cattle amble on the angles of Flat Field. The ladies close 
their plotting books and fill pink teacups, there or thereabouts.

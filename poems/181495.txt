title : Colonoscopy Sonnet

author : Sandra M. Gilbert

On the news tonight, a presidential 
colonoscopy — a tale of   how 
for three whole hours the chief  exec of   trouble 
handed trouble to his vice (although 
no double trouble came), but then no more 
details revealed: no bacterial armies 
multiplying in a flare of  war 
among kingly polyps & no kinky creases. 

Welcome to the presidential gut, 
bubble gum pink, not a spot of  shit 
(after a quick administrative cleanout) 
where global decisions stir & sit in state, 
       and the first physician’s mighty pointer traces 
       only microdrops of   blood in secret places.

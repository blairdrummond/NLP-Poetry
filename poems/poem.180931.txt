An Ode 
Matthew Prior 
1664-1721
Augustan
England
Love, Realistic & Complicated



The merchant, to secure his treasure,
   Conveys it in a borrowed name;
Euphelia serves to grace my measure,
   But Cloe is my real flame.

My softest verse, my darling lyre,
   Upon Euphelia's toilet lay;
When Cloe noted her desire
   That I should sing, that I should play.

My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,
   But with my numbers mix my sighs;
And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise,
   I fix my soul on Cloe's eyes.

Fair Cloe blushed; Euphelia frowned;
   I sung and gazed; I played and trembled;
And Venus to the Loves around
   Remarked how ill we all dissembled.

Beginning on a line by Silvio Rodríguez
How will it taste—the beer the gravedigger 
will drink after bestowing your dirt coat? 
What will he say—you keeled the outrigger 
too south, & when the breakers rolled, no boats 
heard your Mayday? & will he ask his friends 
at the bar—if someone calls a Mayday 
& there is no one at the other end 
of any radio, did Kevin A. 
González really exist? O second 
person, what would you do without you? Where 
would Kevin A. González hide? Our bond 
is over. The red of the rockets’ glare 
has faded. Your grave has been dug. Gone too 
are the days when I tried to speak through you.

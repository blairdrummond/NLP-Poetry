title : The Kindness of Others

author : Cathy Song

text : 
The kindness of others   
is all they ever wanted,   
the laughter of neighbors 
prospering in the blue light of summer. 

Those of the small sputtering flame   
and the sudden white sprung hair, 
who feed off envy and grow old quickly,   
desire largesse. 

The role of poor relation   
evokes a lack 
they are not apt to admit,   
or unbearable pity. 

They prefer to penetrate the giver’s   
effortless knack of giving 
they perceive as vitality, 
a pulsating entity 

that rewards the kindness of others   
tenfold. 
This they have witnessed. 
This they have tabulated relentlessly. 

The generosity of others 
whose spirits, like their long-legged   
children blossoming into a progeny   
of orchards and fields, flourish. 

Those who have never known kindness   
drag into the privacy of their smallness   
the baskets of fruit 
appearing year after year on their porches, 

to be picked apart 
in the hushed posture of thieves. 
They peel skin, probe flesh 
the color of honey 

as if the seeds will yield something   
other than a glimmer of sweet air   
rising from the roots of trees 
and licorice-laced, half-opened leaves. 

Those of the small flame, 
who feed off envy and grow old quickly,   
live out their lives 
hungry, 

glaring at themselves across the table,   
wife of the cruel mouth, 
husband of the thin broth 
trickling like spittle.

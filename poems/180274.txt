title : After the Air Tattoo

author : Fiona Sampson

text : 
All in the stilly night the muntjac 
roars from its hedge: a barking roar 
of July, heat, its own broken-open 
fruition 
                      under black 
viscose, a sky 
static with plane-roar. 

The intermission after the greatest air show in the world; 
fields and lane recovering; 
tarmac tonguing sky again, 
languid 
in the summer half-dark, towards Fairford 

where ancient glass trembles,   
facets of dark open to tumble out 
king, revenge-tragedy, triumphal colors of God.

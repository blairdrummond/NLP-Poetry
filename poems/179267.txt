title : After a God

author : Jenny Browne

text : 
The man I love most says one day 
he will take a ballpoint pen and connect   
the stars across this freckled 
scoop of chest and milky way. 
We’ll cross the slope 
of pale belly and name 
the new constellation after a god 
who shows people 
all the places they might shine.

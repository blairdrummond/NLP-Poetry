Legend 
Hart Crane 
1899-1932
Modern





As silent as a mirror is believed 
Realities plunge in silence by ... 

I am not ready for repentance; 
Nor to match regrets. For the moth 
Bends no more than the still 
Imploring flame. And tremorous 
In the white falling flakes 
Kisses are,-- 
The only worth all granting. 

It is to be learned-- 
This cleaving and this burning, 
But only by the one who 
Spends out himself again. 

Twice and twice 
(Again the smoking souvenir, 
Bleeding eidolon!) and yet again. 
Until the bright logic is won 
Unwhispering as a mirror 
Is believed. 

Then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry 
Shall string some constant harmony,-- 
Relentless caper for all those who step 
The legend of their youth into the noon.

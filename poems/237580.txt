title : My Sin

author : Chungmi Kim

text : 
My sin is
an act of cruelty
depriving myself
of worldly desires.

 Locked in a rented room
I sit all day, listening
to the murmurs
of many-headed visions.

 Cockroaches are
my temporary friends
dwelling
in their underground
castles.

 The ocean is
my mother I visit in need
of love
and companionship.
She only listens
to my laughs and cries
like God in presence.

 Old wounds
all over again
come
hand in hand
off and on
like jealous friends
wanting someone elseâ€™s credit.

Under a lamp in the night
I meet a unicorn
sitting
in my mirror.

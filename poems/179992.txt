title : Nest

author : Marianne Boruch

text : 
I walked out, and the nest   
was already there by the step.  Woven basket   
of a saint   
sent back to life as a bird   
who proceeded to make   
a mess of things.  Wind   
right through it, and any eggs   
long vanished.  But in my hand it was   
intricate pleasure, even the thorny reeds   
softened in the weave.  And the fading   
leaf mold, hardly   
itself anymore, merely a trick   
of light, if light   
can be tricked.  Deep in a life   
is another life.  I walked out, the nest   
already by the step.

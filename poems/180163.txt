title : Leaf Litter on Rock Face

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
Things are not 
unmoving (or else what   

is ing there for?) 
The things once-living   

fall on the never-living   
all the more movingly for the eye 

that passes over them. 
The wind wells up 

to spill a trail 
of onces off the nevers, 

take opaque from eye 
to mind, or near it — 

every rocking takes some leaving 
to a stonish spirit.

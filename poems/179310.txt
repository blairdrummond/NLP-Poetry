Things happen when you drink too much mescal. 
One night, with not enough food in my belly, 
he kept on buying.   I’m a girl who’ll fall 
damn near in love with gratitude and, well, he 
was hot and generous and so the least 
that I could do was let him kiss me, hard 
and soft and any way you want it, beast 
and beauty, lime and salt—sweet Bacchus’ pards— 
and when his friend showed up I felt so warm 
and generous I let him kiss me too. 
His buddy asked me if it was the worm 
inside that makes me do the things I do. 
I wasn’t sure which worm he meant, the one 
I ate?   The one that eats at me alone?

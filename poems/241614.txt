title : Peach Fires﻿

author : David St. John

text : 
Out in the orchards the dogs stood

Almost frozen in the bleak spring night 
& Mister dragged out into the rows 
Between his peach trees the old dry limbs

Building at regular intervals careful pyres 
While the teeth of the dogs chattered & snapped 
& the ice began to hang long as whiskers

From the globes along the branches 
& at his signal we set the piles of branches ablaze 
Tending each carefully so as not to scorch

The trees as we steadily fed those flames 
Just enough to send a rippling glow along 
Those acres of orchard where that body—

Sister Winter—had been held so wisely to the fire

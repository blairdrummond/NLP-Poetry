title : In Response to a Rumor That the Oldest Whorehouse in Wheeling, West Virginia Has Been Condemned

author : James Wright

text : 
I will grieve alone, 
As I strolled alone, years ago, down along   
The Ohio shore. 
I hid in the hobo jungle weeds 
Upstream from the sewer main, 
Pondering, gazing. 

I saw, down river, 
At Twenty-third and Water Streets 
By the vinegar works, 
The doors open in early evening. 
Swinging their purses, the women   
Poured down the long street to the river   
And into the river. 

I do not know how it was 
They could drown every evening. 
What time near dawn did they climb up the other shore,   
Drying their wings? 

For the river at Wheeling, West Virginia,   
Has only two shores: 
The one in hell, the other 
In Bridgeport, Ohio. 

And nobody would commit suicide, only   
To find beyond death   
Bridgeport, Ohio.

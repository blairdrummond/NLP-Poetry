title : For Gustave Moreau

author : Robin Blaser

text : 
The streets are my body
or rather the wish
of the skin to put on
the grass in a gold rain

not vice-versa,
the lips twisting to allow
the tongue to play in 
the broken mirror on the floor
Catches an arm
a distance
                 the light
at the ceiling
                    This kills
the lift begged
of a magical hand

I have walked a long way
traced in these pieces
an arm
a crotch     The queen
of faerie guarded
by blue-winged griffins

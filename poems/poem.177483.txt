Sing a While Longer 
Edwin Markham 
1852-1940


Time & Brevity, Living

Rhymed Stanza

Has the bright sun set, 
   Has the gale grown stronger?   
Still we'll not grieve yet: 
   We will sing a while longer! 

Has our youth been met   
   By Time the wronger?   
Let us not grieve yet, 
   Let us sing a while longer! 

Is the world beset, 
   Do the sorrows throng her?   
Let us not grieve yet: 
   Let us sing a while longer!

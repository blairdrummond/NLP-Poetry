This is about heroes, and you should know 
I do not mean old men with membranous snow 
Already patching them on hand and cheek; 
I mean the medaled models from the Greek 
On whom the air force lavishes technique 
Like tennis lessons and engineering toys 
Given at schools for preparatory boys. 

Say what you will, this flyer on his base 
Who attends airdromes is the immortal ace 
Training to come out of some urgent East 
Greater astride his apocalyptic beast 
Than any movie star: the new high priest. 
To glimpse him people will abandon cover 
And in his thunder die as for a lover. 

Pious and helmeted he lives these nones 
Attentive to the voices in his phones 
And calculating when will be the ides 
Through his impatience with the time he bides 
In long equations as the slide rule slides; 
There is no telling the ominous from calm 
In practice runs to drop a perfect bomb. 

Nourished and celibate, tanned, tall, erect 
As he navigates and crosshairs intersect, 
He dreams a lissome girl and highschool kiss: 
Physicians have no thought of mending this; 
The natural death is one he may not miss: 
Whoever said time steals without a sound? 
It makes a noise of bandage being wound. 

Little by little grows the good machine 
Preening equipment as pterodactyls preen; 
And when the night pins down the firmament 
He goes aloft to fly by instrument 
Limning the stars on graphs where light is bent: 
To fly in squadron and to walk in squad, 
This is the double-natured demigod.

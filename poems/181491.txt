title : Photo (Op/tative) Synthesis

text : 
The general increase in green 
accords in me 
with a growing and specific gravity 
about — it hopes —   
to be undone like a bud. 

What kind of   leaf 
or the existence of  bugs 
or the always later rumor 
of   ravishment by wind or water 
don’t interest me. 

Sun does. 
Come close. 

Come slow. 
And look me again in the eyes 
as you do.

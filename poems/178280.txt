title : Homecoming

author : Keith Althaus

text : 
We drove through the gates 
into a maze of little roads, 
with speed bumps now, 
that circled a pavilion, 
field house, and ran past 
the playing fields and wound 
their way up to the cluster 
of wood and stone buildings 
of the school you went to once. 
The green was returning to 
the trees and lawn, the lake 
was still half-lidded with ice 
and blind in the middle. 
There was nobody around 
except a few cars in front 
of the administration. It must 
have been spring break. 
We left without ever getting out 
of the car. You were quiet 
that night, the next day, 
the way after heavy rain 
that the earth cannot absorb, 
the water lies in pools 
in unexpected places for days 
until it disappears.

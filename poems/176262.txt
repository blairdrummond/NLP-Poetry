If your bearded friend 
helps you catch the trout   
barehanded 
in the pool of the dream   
and you carry it in his pail   
barefoot 
up the rocky stream 
to the playhouse where he fries it in his pan; 
if you snip the dill 
for the carrots and then swim 
until your lips are bluer than the lake 
where will it take you? 
Not anywhere as pure 
and primal as these sunstruck days   
sistered by starstruck nights.   
Don’t cloud the drowning   
brightness of your eyes, 
don’t answer my asking look   
with anything but the truth,   
don’t spill the fresh-picked   
raspberries on the car seat 
and stain your shirt with indelible blood. 

Or spill them, darling.   
How else will you know 
the color of crushed time; 
how else will you feel 
what it is to change and remember, 
to lose and absorb 
this summer inside you, 
xylem and phloem of your leafy future   
already starting to spread its shade above us?

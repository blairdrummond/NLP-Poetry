title : Lawyer and Child

author : James Whitcomb Riley

text : 
How large was Alexander, father,
       That parties designate
The historic gentleman as rather
       Inordinately great?

Why, son, to speak with conscientious
       Regard for history,
Waiving all claims, of course, to heights pretentious,—
       About the size of me.

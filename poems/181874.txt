My father had several times expressed a fear of being  buried alive. I insisted that the doctor should do whatever  was necessary. The doctor asked me to leave the  room. When I came back, he was able to assure me that  Renoir was dead!   jean renoir
It is not 1937 for long. A clump of ash trees and a walk 
Down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up 
In a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings 
Of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle 
Of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while 
At their center the projectionist, Jean Renoir, 
On a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds, 
And turtles for the sleepy children. Corks 
Come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset 
And, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks 

Into the boathouse to the linens: at last, it is 1915! 
A bird screams over the lake, two bats 
Flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp, 
Interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over 
Water the the acceptance of white tablecloths 
On the darkening shore of the lake. A torch is lit 
For its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects. 
This film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders, 
Not music and algebra but 
A war and, then, yet another war. . . 

But we begin with the captured officers digging 
A tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall. 
The Boches observe the Frenchmen working 
With their hoes as from the trousers of a boy 
Dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure! 
The prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled 
With snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow 
While Germans with rifles on a hill 
Are unable to kill them, for they have escaped 
Into Switzerland with its feather-brushed trees 

And patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village. 
Isn’t this the ending of the film? 
No! I’m sorry but 
There is a single blossom 
On the geranium, and when it falls, Captain de Boeldieu 
Dies, discovering his afterlife along a November road— 
He does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh 
Beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film 
Suffers its true conclusion. The two men hiding 
In the marsh will escape across the border, only 
To be returned to the continuing war. This is why there 
Is no importance to your version of the story. And there 
Will be another war. And more horror for the geranium! 
So, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive 
A steamer trunk filled with women’s clothing, 
They will all perform in a revue: a chorus 
Of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings, 
Garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and 
Large paper carnations riding up like epaulets 

On their broad shoulders. These poignant inversions 
Are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right 
Has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous 
Until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing, 
In this comedy, their national anthem! The Russian 
Prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their 
Mysterious Czarina; the men open it expecting vodka 
And sausages. The box is filled with straw 
And books on cooking, painting, and algebra. In disgust 
They burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier 

Of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe! 
Now, these officers who are escape artists are moved 
As an elite corps and north to Wintersborn. Later, 
They are taken to a damp limestone castle   
From which no one will escape. The Commandant 
Is the stoic aristocrat, Rauffenstein, his head is in 
A brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon. 
I mean no disrespect, but the balding Rauffenstein is 
An abject picture of suffering. His villa has but one 
Flower, a tall laden geranium. 

Rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, Boeldieu, 
Are friends. Both would know that to clear a monocle 
One uses spirits of vinegar. They stand confirmed 
In manner beside a squirrel cage. Rauffenstein feels 
Superior to the other two principals, the rich 
Jew, Rosenthal, and the charming emotional Marechal. 
These two hide in the marsh while Boeldieu dies 
Of a bullet wound. Only a king may kill a king! 
And Rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim 
But missing the leg; he severed in three places 
Boeldieu’s intestine! 

The Captain is given a room in the turret that holds 
The flowering geranium. Now comes the oratio obliqua 
Of the marksman, Rauffenstein; the disfigured Commandant 
Is sincerely saddened 
At having killed the noble Captain. But before 
The shooting and escape we sensed the Captain’s 
Sacrifice was not sacrifice, or suicide, but 
The grand escape—a country road into another landscape. . . 
There are bells tolling down in the village. 
Rosenthal and Marechal with ropes have dropped 

Past the castle’s battlements to the ground. 
They run away across snowy farmland. Marechal’s teeth 
Are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco. 
Rosenthal and Marechal are extremes who have 
Strong feelings for each other. They are befriended 
By a German widow, Ulsa, and her daughter, Lotte; 
Ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome Jew. He promises 
To return for her when the war is over. He 
Will lose both his legs at Mégéglise. 
This is not known within the story, but he’ll bleed 

To death beside a little bridge. He lived his illusion 
In the Orient of Delacroix, his servants were Syrians 
And Negroes. He loved the little ivory spoons that 
Chinese women in the open markets use to bathe 
And freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out 
Of huge clay bowls. . . 
In the boathouse the children sleep, while Jean’s 
Oldest cousin, drunken, falls out of a rowboat. 
The lone swimmer has joined Renior on the raft. 
The film now reveals the first diversion 
As all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing 
Several hundred wooden flutes, the noise is like women 
Crying over the fresh mounds at Verdun. This diversion 
Is not illusion 
And as the Boches collect the flutes, the drunken cousin 
Tries to join Renior on the raft. Boeldieu flees 
To the heights of the castle, the second diversion! 
We hear: Halt! Halt! Halt! 
A gunshot, and chowder with blood falls from Boeldieu’s 
Opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard. 

There are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled 
Courtyard floor. Scissors cut the blue blossom 
From the geranium. Boeldieu will die. . . dead,   
He awakens on a country road where, now a peasant, 
He walks a white horse under the looming, bare trees. 
Rosenthal and Marechal are watching 
As they hide in the dead marsh flowers of 
An early November. They are alive. They do not 
Recognize their friend. Renoir’s cousin, asking for 
More wine, climbing onto the raft, spills 

Everything, and the projector with its crude lamp 
Sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake— 
Its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere 
Lost off a cable that frayed, whoever is alive 
Inside the iron bell is experiencing 
An eternal falling through water without the promise 
Of a bottom. . . it’s 1937, the children 
Asleep in the boathouse are being aroused, they wake 
To a bat caught in the wall of linen, they think it’s 
Their uncle still casting images of animals for them. . .

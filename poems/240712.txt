title : The Abuelita Poem

I. SKIN & CORN
  
 Her brown skin glistens as the sun
 pours through the kitchen window
 like gold leche. After grinding
 the nixtamal, a word so beautifully ethnic
 it must not only be italicized but underlined
 to let you, the reader, know you’ve encountered
 something beautifully ethnic, she kneads
 with the hands of centuries-old ancestor
 spirits who magically yet realistically posses her
 until the masa is smooth as a lowrider’s
 chrome bumper. And I know she must do this
 with care because it says so on a website
 that explains how to make homemade corn tortillas.
 So much labor for this peasant bread,
 this edible art birthed from Abuelitas’s
 brown skin, which is still glistening
 in the sun.
       

II. APOLOGY
  
 Before she died I called my abuelita
 grandma. I cannot remember
 if she made corn tortillas from scratch
 but, O, how she’d flip the factory fresh
 El Milagros (Quality Since 1950)
 on the burner, bathe them in butter
 & salt for her grandchildren.
 How she’d knead the buttons
 on the telephone, order me food
 from Pizza Hut. I assure you,
 gentle reader, this was done
 with the spirit of Mesoamérica
 ablaze in her fingertips.

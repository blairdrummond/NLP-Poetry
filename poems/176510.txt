title : Shame

author : Joshua Weiner

text : 
I hid the deed: 
                                 —would my life end? 

The grackle called it back again. 

The grackle then 
                                 became   

my life. A swan’s neck   
curling to ask   
                               what if   

uncurled   
to reach   into the reed, 

and struck the stone   
of what I did. 

The grackle called it back again. 

The grackle called it back again.

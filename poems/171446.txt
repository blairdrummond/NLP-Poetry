title : Ars Amoris

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
Speak to her heart!   
That manic force   
When wits depart   
Forbids remorse. 

Dream with her dreaming   
Until her lust 
Seems to her seeming   
An act of trust! 

Do without doing!   
Love’s wilful potion   
Veils the ensuing, 
And brief, commotion.

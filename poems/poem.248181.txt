I have come to the borders of sleep, 
 The unfathomable deep
 Forest where all must lose
 Their way, however straight, 
 Or winding, soon or late;
 They cannot choose. 
  
 Many a road and track
 That, since the dawn's first crack,
 Up to the forest brink, 
 Deceived the travellers,
 Suddenly now blurs,
 And in they sink. 
  
 Here love ends,
 Despair, ambition ends;
 All pleasure and all trouble,
 Although most sweet or bitter, 
 Here ends in sleep that is sweeter 
 Than tasks most noble. 
  
 There is not any book 
 Or face of dearest look
 That I would not turn from now 
 To go into the unknown
 I must enter, and leave, alone, 
 I know not how. 
  
 The tall forest towers; 
 Its cloudy foliage lowers 
 Ahead, shelf above shelf; 
 Its silence I hear and obey 
 That I may lose my way 
 And myself.

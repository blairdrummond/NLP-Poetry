1. INSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A TREE 

Beautiful women in smoky blue culottes 
lying around on fluffy pink pillows 
beneath windows onto charming views, 
sea views, seasonal leaves and trees. 
Inside is outside and outside inside. 
Smell of saltwater swimming in the room. 


2. OUTSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A ROCKING CHAIR 

Shadow of lighthouse along the beach. 
Whales spotted every day lately 
though winterâ€™s two months yet. 
The evening is as warm as an interior. 
Silverlight lagoonlight, snorkeling light. 
And a line of joggers against last light. 
Blue smoke snaking up the pink sky.

title : Snow

White people leave the express
 at 96th Street, collectively,
 like pigeons from a live wire
 or hope from the hearts of Harlem.
 And I’m one of them, although
 my lover sleeps two stops north between
 Malcolm X and Adam Clayton Powell
 Boulevards, wishing my ass
 were cupped inside her knees and belly,
 wishing this in a dream thick
 with inequalities.
  
 I live on Riverside Drive. My face
 helped get me here. I was
 ruddy with anticipation the day
 I interviewed for the rooms
 near the park with its
 snow-covered maples. I was full
 of undisguised hope as I
 strolled along the river, believing
 I belonged there, that my people
 inherited this wonderland
 unequivocally, as if they deserved it.
  
 My lover buys twinkies from the Arabs,
 bootleg tapes on ‘25th,
 and carries a blade in her back
 pocket although her hands
 are the gentlest I’ve known.
 She ignores the piss smells
 on the corner, the sirens
 at 4 A.M., the men whose brains
 have dissolved in rum. And tries
 to trust a white woman who
 sleeps near the trees of Riverside.
  
 When we go out together,
 we avoid expensive 
 cafés on Columbus Avenue, jaunts
 to the Upper East Side. Harlem
 eyes us suspiciously or with
 contempt beneath half-closed lids.
 We have friends there,
 hidden in the ruins like gold, who
 accept us. When it snows,
 we walk boldly anywhere, as if the snow
 were a protection, or a death.

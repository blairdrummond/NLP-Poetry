title : What the Bones Know ﻿

text : 
Remembering the past
 And gloating at it now,
 I know the frozen brow
 And shaking sides of lust
 Will dog me at my death
 To catch my ghostly breath.
  
           I think that Yeats was right,
           That lust and love are one.
           The body of this night 
           May beggar me to death,
           But we are not undone
           Who love with all our breath.
  
                      I know that Proust was wrong,
                      His wheeze: love, to survive,
                      Needs jealousy, and death
                      And lust, to make it strong
                      Or goose it back alive.
                      Proust took away my breath.
  
                                  The later Yeats was right
                                  To think of sex and death
                                  And nothing else. Why wait
                                  Till we are turning old?
                                  My thoughts are hot and cold.
                                  I do not waste my breath.

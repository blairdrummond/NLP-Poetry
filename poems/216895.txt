title : Snakeskin

author : Liz Beasely

text : 
Clouds thin into form: a hawk 
pulling a tail of rings—beads 
of an abacus, the mathematics 
of light—a lengthening spine, 
snakeskin no longer inhabited. 
All day I'm giving a name 
for what isn't there. Yet somewhere 
we've left our likeness, the hollow 
shapes of us. Even though the snake 
has slipped into the shade, 
the shed skin, deceptively whole, 
hidden in the sun-flecked grass, 
remembers what it once held.

title : "Where the Bee Sucks, There Suck I"

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
Where the bee sucks, there suck I: 
In a cowslip’s bell I lie; 
There I couch when owls do cry. 
On the bat’s back I do fly 
After summer merrily.   
Merrily, merrily shall I live now 
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

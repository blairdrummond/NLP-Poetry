title : Eschatology of the Lexicon

author : J. Allyn Rosser

text : 
They come down to us   
rounding the corners of centuries   
at an innocent jog, shedding letters   
and most of the grand old meanings   
to take on the sleek new hide   
our day demands, a snappier   
nap that can repel the stare   
of a rather less tactful sun;   

they come down to us com-   
pounding, bounding in idiot   
joy, they come with that trustful   
tired old mutt look, that soft woof,   
warm doggie sigh on the knee,   
hoping for what? Some reason,   
no doubt, to continue sounding.   
Give me one good reason,   

they come down to us saying,   
as if we could have one without them.

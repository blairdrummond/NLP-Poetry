title : Ah the Delight . . .

author : Franco Fortini

text : 
Ah the delight of dawn! 
Over the grassy lawn 
the spark of silk, of silk 
spat out by some small spider 
to be the breeze's pawn. 

A distant siren whines 
from the freeway. Sun shines! 
What a Sunday, what peace! 
An old man's tidy peace, 
his favorite hour of all. 

The ants march on in rows. 
They're off to do who knows 
what harm to the ripe pears ... 
Such sun now on the wall! 
The lizards heed its call.

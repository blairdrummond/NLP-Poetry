Created purely from glass the saint stands,   
Exposing his gifted quite empty hands   
Like a conjurer about to begin, 
A righteous man begging of righteous men.

In the sun lily-and-gold-coloured, 
Filtering the cruder light, he has endured,   
A feature for our regard; and will keep;   
Of worldly purity the stained archetype.

The scummed pond twitches. The great holly-tree,   
Emptied and shut, blows clear of wasting snow,   
The common, puddled substance: beneath,   
Like a revealed mineral, a new earth.

Just look, 'tis quarter past six, love--    
   And not even the fires are caught; 
Well, you know I must be at the office--    
   But, as usual, the breakfast 'll be late. 

Now hurry and wake up the children; 
   And dress them as fast as you can; 
'Poor dearies,' I know they'll be tardy, 
   Dear me, 'what a slow, poky man!' 

Have the tenderloin broiled nice and juicy--    
   Have the toast browned and buttered all right; 
And be sure you settle the coffee: 
   Be sure that the silver is bright. 

When ready, just run up and call me--   
   At eight, to the office I go, 
Lest poverty, grim, should o'ertake us--    
   ''Tis bread and butter,' you know. 

The bottom from stocks may fall out, 
   My bonds may get below par; 
Then surely, I seldom could spare you 
   A nickel, to buy a cigar. 

All ready? Now, while I am eating, 
   Just bring up my wheel to the door; 
Then wash up the dishes; and, mind now, 
   Have dinner promptly at four; 

For tonight is our Woman's Convention, 
   And I am to speak first, you know--   
The men veto us in private, 
   But in public they shout, 'That's so.' 

So 'by-by' - In case of a rap, love, 
   Before opening the door, you must look; 
O! how could a civilized woman 
   Exist, without a man cook.

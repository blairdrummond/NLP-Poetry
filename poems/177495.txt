title : from Stanzas in Meditation: Stanza I

author : Gertrude Stein

text : 
I caught a bird which made a ball   
And they thought better of it. 
But it is all of which they taught 
That they were in a hurry yet 
In a kind of a way they meant it best 
That they should change in and on account   
But they must not stare when they manage   
Whatever they are occasionally liable to do 
It is often easy to pursue them once in a while   
And in a way there is no repose 
They like it as well as they ever did   
But it is very often just by the time   
That they are able to separate 
In which case in effect they could 
Not only be very often present perfectly   
In each way whichever they chose.   
All of this never matters in authority 
But this which they need as they are alike   
Or in an especial case they will fulfill 
Not only what they have at their instigation   
Made for it as a decision in its entirety   
Made that they minded as well as blinded   
Lengthened for them welcome in repose   
But which they open as a chance 
But made it be perfectly their allowance   
All which they antagonise as once for all   
Kindly have it joined as they mind

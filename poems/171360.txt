title : Zeus and Apollo

author : David Rivard

text : 
Written on clapboard or asbestos siding, the cartoony   
spray-paint signatures of Apollo and Zeus, 
two home boys out bombing last night in thick fog. 
Fog near the shade of pearls. Except they didn’t see the mist   
that way, glad for their thin leather gloves. 
Wind raw at the wide avenue, so they cut 
from there to here. 
                              Even if this is in the past 
tense, tense of the totally chilled-out, 
even if they argued here over Krylon blue or candy-apple red,   
that doesn’t mean they knocked-off and streaked home then.   
And if I saw fog the shade of pearls 
it doesn’t mean my heart in its own corrosive and healing fog   
can’t tug on thin leather gloves and stand 
in front of a wall, pissing off the Fates 
and whoever else owns that wall. Whoever owns it   
means less than the dry, fallen leaves of eucalyptus   
blown crackling over tar and concrete 
and sounding, when you shut your eyes, like every tree   
bursting into leaf for the first time, speeded-up 
like the first minute of the world.

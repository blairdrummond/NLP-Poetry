“Burnished,” when applied to limbs,
 refers you to furniture, or wood
 at least, a hint the skin has been burned
 beyond the human, & then beyond.
  
 Necessary for the removal of skin
 from a burnished limb is an implement
 sharper rather than duller, wieldy
 & willing to dig without displacement.
  
 The scrape of flint on a burnished limb
 —if you say “arm” you must mean it—
 resembles, no doubt, a chisel (of iron?)
 that furls what’s before it, away.
  
 The point of whatever has been lost
 between the stasis of the burnished limb
 & its movement away from the rest
 of what you have identified as skin,
  
 the skin of a burnished limb,
 is to bring to bear the thought of bone
 & how it relates or, better, responds
 to its covering uncurling from it

flake by flake & amassing, forceless,
on the floor, the floor you will describe
as cement or concrete, at least
rug- and wood-less, the wood being

the skin of the burnished limb,
until the skin is just another piece
of your household furniture.

dans le simple appareil D’une beauté qu’on vient d’arracher au sommeil.
Smoothed by sleep and ruffled by your dreams   
The surface of the little lake 
Fed by unconscious tributary streams,   
Unbroken by the breezes nightmares make,   
Like your face looks fathomless and seems   
Bottomless till light or noises wake. 
You move and murmur and almost awake. 

I admire but do not wish to enter, 
Like any wanderer beside 
Moonlit water in midwinter 
Who as a simulacrum for the tide 
Casting a pebble into the calm centre   
Watches the circles spread from side to side.   
I wait for you and morning at your side. 

Such sources feed the mirror of your mind,   
I dare not touch the surface of your sleep.   
But to love by ignorance resigned, 
Infatuated guardian, I keep 
Watch beside a fountain where I find   
No image, for images too deep, 
Above your breathing regular and deep.

Concord Hymn 
Jack Spicer 
1925-1965

U.S., Western
Nature, Seas, Rivers, & Streams

Imagery, Simile

Your joke
Is like a lake
That lies there without any thought
And sees
Dead seas
The birds fly
Around there
Bewildered by its blue without any thought of water
Without any thought
Of water.

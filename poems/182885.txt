title : Paean to Place

                                        And the place 
                                        was water             
                                                                                                             
Fish 
      fowl 
            flood 
      Water lily mud 
My life 

in the leaves and on water 
My mother and I 
                      born 
in swale and swamp and sworn 
to water 

My father 
thru marsh fog 
      sculled down 
            from high ground 
saw her face 

at the organ 
bore the weight of lake water 
      and the cold— 
he seined for carp to be sold 
that their daughter 

might go high 
on land 
      to learn 
Saw his wife turn 
deaf 

and away 
She 
      who knew boats 
            and ropes 
no longer played 




She helped him string out nets 
for tarring 
      And she could shoot 
            He was cool 
to the man 

who stole his minnows 
by night and next day offered 
      to sell them back 
            He brought in a sack 
of dandelion greens 

if no flood 
No oranges—none at hand 
      No marsh marigold 
            where the water rose 
He kept us afloat 




I mourn her not hearing canvasbacks 
their blast-off rise 
      from the water 
            Not hearing sora 
rails’s sweet 

spoon-tapped waterglass- 
descending scale- 
      tear-drop-tittle 
            Did she giggle 
as a girl? 




His skiff skimmed 
the coiled celery now gone 
      from these streams 
            due to carp 
He knew duckweed 

fall-migrates 
toward Mud Lake bottom 
      Knew what lay 
            under leaf decay 
and on pickerel weeds 

before summer hum 
To be counted on: 
      new leaves 
            new dead 
leaves 




He could not 
—like water bugs— 
      stride surface tension 
            He netted 
loneliness 

As to his bright new car 
my mother—her house 
      next his—averred: 
            A hummingbird 
can’t haul 

Anchored here 
in the rise and sink 
      of life— 
            middle years’ nights 
he sat 

beside his shoes 
rocking his chair 
      Roped not “looped 
            in the loop 
of her hair” 




I grew in green 
slide and slant 
      of shore and shade 
            Child-time—wade 
thru weeds 

Maples to swing from 
Pewee-glissando 
      sublime 
            slime- 
song 

Grew riding the river 
Books 
      at home-pier 
            Shelley could steer 
as he read 




I was the solitary plover 
a pencil 
      for a wing-bone 
From the secret notes 
I must tilt 

upon the pressure 
execute and adjust 
      In us sea-air rhythm 
“We live by the urgent wave 
of the verse” 




Seven year molt 
for the solitary bird 
      and so young 
Seven years the one 
dress 

for town once a week 
One for home 
      faded blue-striped 
as she piped 
her cry 




Dancing grounds 
my people had none 
      woodcocks had— 
      backland- 
air around 

Solemnities 
such as what flower 
      to take 
      to grandfather’s grave 
unless 

water lilies— 
he who’d bowed his head 
      to grass as he mowed 
      Iris now grows 
on fill 

for the two 
and for him 
      where they lie 
      How much less am I 
in the dark than they?    




Effort lay in us 
before religions 
      at pond bottom 
            All things move toward 
the light 

except those 
that freely work down 
      to oceans’ black depths 
            In us an impulse tests 
the unknown 




River rising—flood 
Now melt and leave home 
      Return—broom wet 
            naturally wet 
Under 

soak-heavy rug 
water bugs hatched— 
      no snake in the house 
            Where were they?— 
she 

who knew how to clean up 
after floods 
      he who bailed boats, houses 
            Water endows us 
with buckled floors 

You with sea water running 
in your veins sit down in water 
      Expect the long-stemmed blue 
            speedwell to renew 
itself 




O my floating life 
Do not save love 
      for things 
            Throw things 
to the flood 

ruined 
by the flood 
      Leave the new unbought— 
            all one in the end— 
water 

I possessed 
the high word: 
      The boy my friend 
            played his violin 
in the great hall 




On this stream 
my moonnight memory 
      washed of hardships 
            maneuvers barges 
thru the mouth 

of the river 
They fished in beauty 
      It was not always so 
            In Fishes 
red Mars 

rising 
rides the sloughs and sluices 
      of my mind 
            with the persons 
on the edge

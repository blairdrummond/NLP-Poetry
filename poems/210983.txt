title : Flirtation

After all, there’s no need 
to say anything 

at first. An orange, peeled 
and quartered, flares 

like a tulip on a wedgewood plate 
Anything can happen. 

Outside the sun 
has rolled up her rugs 

and night strewn salt 
across the sky. My heart 

is humming a tune 
I haven’t heard in years! 

Quiet’s cool flesh— 
let’s sniff and eat it. 

There are ways 
to make of the moment 

a topiary 
so the pleasure’s in 

walking through.

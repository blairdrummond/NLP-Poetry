title : We grow accustomed to the Dark - (428)

author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
We grow accustomed to the Dark - 
 When Light is put away -
 As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp 
 To witness her Good bye -
  
 A Moment - We uncertain step 
 For newness of the night -
 Then - fit our Vision to the Dark - 
 And meet the Road  - erect - 
  
 And so of larger - Darknesses -
 Those Evenings of the Brain -
 When not a Moon disclose a sign -
 Or Star - come out - within -
  
 The Bravest - grope a little -
 And sometimes hit a Tree 
 Directly in the Forehead -
 But as they learn to see -
  
 Either the Darkness alters -
 Or something in the sight 
 Adjusts itself to Midnight -
 And Life steps almost straight.

title : Small Kingdom

author : Samuel Menashe

text : 
In their doorways women sit sewing
By the good light of afternoon
And nothing is beyond knowing
Though the sun shall go down soon

A shepherdess near a bramble ditch
And the Princess in the Alcazar
Keep the same precise stitch
And they both can see far

And when the knell tolls
All are wondering whoâ€”
If it is a lady, many bells
For a beggar, one will do

Poems for Weddings

Rhymed Stanza, Syllabic

She that but little patience knew, 
From childhood on, had now so much 
A grey gull lost its fear and flew 
Down to her cell and there alit, 
And there endured her fingers' touch 
And from her fingers ate its bit. 

Did she in touching that lone wing 
Recall the years before her mind 
Became a bitter, an abstract thing, 
Her thought some popular enmity: 
Blind and leader of the blind 
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie? 

When long ago I saw her ride 
Under Ben Bulben to the meet, 
The beauty of her country-side 
With all youth's lonely wildness stirred, 
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet 
Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird: 

Sea-borne, or balanced in the air 
When first it sprang out of the nest 
Upon some lofty rock to stare 
Upon the cloudy canopy, 
While under its storm-beaten breast 
Cried out the hollows of the sea.

title : After the Gentle Poet Kobayashi Issa

text : 
New Year’s morning— 
everything is in blossom!   
   I feel about average. 

   A huge frog and I   
staring at each other,   
   neither of us moves. 

   This moth saw brightness   
in a woman’s chamber— 
   burned to a crisp. 

   Asked how old he was   
the boy in the new kimono   
   stretched out all five fingers. 

   Blossoms at night,   
like people 
   moved by music 

   Napped half the day;   
no one 
   punished me! 

Fiftieth birthday: 

   From now on,   
It’s all clear profit,   
   every sky. 

   Don’t worry, spiders,   
I keep house   
   casually. 

   These sea slugs,   
they just don’t seem   
   Japanese. 

Hell: 

   Bright autumn moon;   
pond snails crying   
   in the saucepan.

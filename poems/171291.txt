title : A Woman Speaks

author : Audre Lorde

text : 
Moon marked and touched by sun   
my magic is unwritten 
but when the sea turns back 
it will leave my shape behind.   
I seek no favor 
untouched by blood 
unrelenting as the curse of love   
permanent as my errors 
or my pride 
I do not mix 
love with pity 
nor hate with scorn 
and if you would know me 
look into the entrails of Uranus   
where the restless oceans pound. 

I do not dwell 
within my birth nor my divinities   
who am ageless and half-grown   
and still seeking 
my sisters 
witches in Dahomey 
wear me inside their coiled cloths   
as our mother did 
mourning. 

I have been woman 
for a long time 
beware my smile 
I am treacherous with old magic   
and the noon's new fury 
with all your wide futures   
promised 
I am 
woman 
and not white.

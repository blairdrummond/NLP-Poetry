title : The End of Summer

Sweet smell of phlox drifting across the lawn—
an early warning of the end of summer. 
August is fading fast, and by September 
the little purple flowers will all be gone.

Season, project, and vacation done. 
One more year in everybody’s life. 
Add a notch to the old hunting knife 
Time keeps testing with a horny thumb.

Over the summer months hung an unspoken 
aura of urgency. In late July
galactic pulsings filled the midnight sky
like silent screaming, so that, strangely woken,

we looked at one another in the dark,
then at the milky magical debris
arcing across, dwarfing our meek mortality. 
There were two ways to live: get on with work,

redeem the time, ignore the imminence
of cataclysm; or else take it slow,
be as tranquil as the neighbors’ cow
we love to tickle through the barbed wire fence 
(she paces through her days in massive innocence, 
or, seeing green pastures, we imagine so).

In fact, not being cows, we have no choice.
Summer or winter, country, city, we
are prisoners from the start and automatically, 
hemmed in, harangued by the one clamorous voice.

Not light but language shocks us out of sleep 
ideas of doom transformed to meteors 
we translate back to portents of the wars 
looming above the nervous watch we keep.

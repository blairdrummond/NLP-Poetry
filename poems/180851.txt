title : "I wish I could remember that first day"

author : Christina Rossetti

text : 
Era gia l’ora che volge il desio.  – Dante Ricorro al tempo ch’io vi vidi prima. – Petrarca 
I wish I could remember that first day, 
    First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
    If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
    So blind was I to see and to foresee,
    So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
    A day of days! I let it come and go
    As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
    First touch of hand in hand – Did one but know!

Couplet

Here lies, to each her parents' ruth, 
Mary, the daughter of their youth; 
Yet all heaven's gifts being heaven's due, 
It makes the father less to rue. 
At six months' end she parted hence 
With safety of her innocence; 
Whose soul heaven's queen, whose name she bears, 
In comfort of her mother's tears, 
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train: 
Where, while that severed doth remain, 
This grave partakes the fleshly birth; 
Which cover lightly, gentle earth!

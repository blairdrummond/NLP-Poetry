Seems lak to me de stars don't shine so bright,   
Seems lak to me de sun done loss his light,   
Seems lak to me der's nothin' goin' right, 
      Sence you went away. 

Seems lak to me de sky ain't half so blue,   
Seems lak to me dat eve'ything wants you,   
Seems lak to me I don't know what to do, 
      Sence you went away. 

Seems lak to me dat eve'ything is wrong,   
Seems lak to me de day's jes twice ez long,   
Seems lak to me de bird's forgot his song, 
      Sence you went away. 

Seems lak to me I jes can't he'p but sigh,   
Seems lak to me ma th'oat keeps gittin' dry,   
Seems lak to me a tear stays in ma eye, 
      Sence you went away.

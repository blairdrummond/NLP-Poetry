After great pain, a formal feeling comes - (372) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Nature, Living, Sorrow & Grieving, The Body



After great pain, a formal feeling comes - 
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs - 
The stiff Heart questions 'was it He, that bore,' 
And 'Yesterday, or Centuries before'? 

The Feet, mechanical, go round - 
A Wooden way 
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought - 
Regardless grown, 
A Quartz contentment, like a stone - 

This is the Hour of Lead - 
Remembered, if outlived, 
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow - 
First - Chill - then Stupor - then the letting go -

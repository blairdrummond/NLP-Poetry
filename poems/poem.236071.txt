My Grave 
Ella Wheeler Wilcox 
1850-1919


Living, Death

Sonnet

If, when I die, I must be buried, let 
No cemetery engulph me -- no lone grot, 
Where the great palpitating world comes not, 
Save when, with heart bowed down and eyelids wet, 
It pays its last sad melancholy debt 
To some outjourneying pilgrim. May my lot 
Be rather to lie in some much-used spot, 
Where human life, with all its noise and fret, 
Throbs on about me. Let the roll of wheels, 
With all earth's sounds of pleasure, commerce, love, 
And rush of hurrying feet surge o'er my head. 
Even in my grave I shall be one who feels 
Close kinship with the pulsing world above; 
And too deep silence would distress me, dead.

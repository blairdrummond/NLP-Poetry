text : 
Aship, reel in fountainhead 
enclosure of roses 
skies indigo, gold moon 

Omphalos triumphant 
“only connect” 
end, point of beginning 

of old, apotheosis 
chandelier fond du lac 
cross (mortal) hid boundary 

compass beyond confines 
music of the spheres solved, 
mosaic of Cosmos 

snowflakes lit darkest sea, 
bowsprit the deeps 
bound white antipodes 

such conflagration of souls 
Dawn in Erewhon, 
corporeal cornucopia 








one being, surround in bloom 
flow essential seed 
portal system Milky Way 

as Unmoved Mover under orders 
axis mundi, ascend scale 
organism omnipotent 

poised in flesh, 
awake horns psaltery 
Fanfare for the Common Man 

mind set razor an edge, 
blood fulfill final ablution 
fire purify baton 

Oompapah! to lead the band 
anystray orchestra 
knows who destination 

core of the universe 
(so rings redwood of eons) 
gospel sentience 








Lo! allegro non troppo 
remake mankind, 
a joyous noise into the void 

“from going to and fro 
in the earth, and from walking 
up and down in it” 

as speech arc Simulacrum, O 
chorus us Homo Sapiens 
in a major key! 

tools, consonant & vowel 
to fashion a voice 
commensurate wheel of time 

Origins great aorta 
leaved from the wrist up, but 
yet to attain the skies 

all arrowed a rainbow midair, 
ad astra per aspera 
countdown for Lift Off

title : Morning

author : Billy Collins

text : 
Why do we bother with the rest of the day, 
the swale of the afternoon, 
the sudden dip into evening,

then night with his notorious perfumes, 
his many-pointed stars?

This is the best—
throwing off the light covers,
feet on the cold floor,
and buzzing around the house on espresso—

maybe a splash of water on the face, 
a palmful of vitamins—
but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,

dictionary and atlas open on the rug,
the typewriter waiting for the key of the head, 
a cello on the radio,

and, if necessary, the windows—
trees fifty, a hundred years old 
out there,
heavy clouds on the way
and the lawn steaming like a horse 
in the early morning.

title : A Black Man Talks of Reaping

author : Arna Bontemps

text : 
I have sown beside all waters in my day. 
I planted deep, within my heart the fear 
that wind or fowl would take the grain away. 
I planted safe against this stark, lean year.   

I scattered seed enough to plant the land 
in rows from Canada to Mexico 
but for my reaping only what the hand 
can hold at once is all that I can show. 

Yet what I sowed and what the orchard yields 
my brother's sons are gathering stalk and root; 
small wonder then my children glean in fields 
they have not sown, and feed on bitter fruit.

title : III Mon. May [1734] hath xxxi days.

author : Benjamin Franklin

text : 
Wedlock, as old Men note, hath likened been, 
Unto a publick Crowd or common Rout; 
Where those that are without would fain get in, 
And those that are within would fain get out. 
Grief often treads upon the Heels of Pleasure, 
Marry’d in Haste, we oft repent at Leisure; 
Some by Experience find these Words misplac’ed, 
Marry’d at Leisure, they repent in Haste.

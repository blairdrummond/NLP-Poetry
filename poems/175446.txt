title : The Little Walls Before China

A courtier speaks to Ch’in Shih-huang-ti, ca. 210 B.C.
Highness, the former walls were helpless. They 
stood alone in the middle of small fields 
protecting nothing. A single peasant’s holding 
engulfed each one as it ran briefly, straight 
from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous steps 
of broken stone at both ends. Only head-high, 
without the towers, gates and towns of your great wall, 
they stuck where they were, never rising over hills 
or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy masonry 
and a mystery: who built them, how long ago, 
what for? They seemed to have no role but balking 
the reaper and the ox; their bases made 
islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild flowers 
and shrubs sprouted. 

                               So all the people praise you 
for burying such walls and their memory 
in your vast one, which joins them, stretching far 
beyond where they once crumbled to hold your Empire: 
a wall which therefore can never have an end 
but has to go on extending itself forever. 
How useful, how cogent your wall is: a pale 
for the civilized, a dike against the wild people 
outside, who trade their quiet human blood 
for the rage of gods, tearing men to pieces, 
throwing them, watching them fall. In burying 
those little walls, Lord, you have covered our shame 
at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty works 
were so pointless, or so pitiably useless. 
Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures? 
So that some human work would rise over the flats 
and weather till it seemed not human? Only 
so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks: 
docile-seeming, yet sullenly opposed 
to use, and when compelled, only half serving, 
reserving from the functions that we give them 
a secret and idle self. The peasants would make 
lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they served 
for this alone. 

                        Now scholars, Lord, are saying 
the gods are not bulls and cows. That in ancient times 
we herded these animals to keep from starving 
and going naked, and so came the old custom 
of thinking them gods—from dependence. In my youth, 
I know, the peasants said just the opposite. 
Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow 
were gathered to be adored more easily, 
till people noticed how they let themselves 
be driven and penned. Next came the first murders 
against these gods, and the careful observation 
that they stood to be killed. And so their cult became 
contempt of beings that would live with us 
and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we began 
to breed them. That is why, the farmer says, 
cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, cherished 
with labour that makes him their slave, and that is why 
in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with fear, 
with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks into 
stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted meat, 
getting children, his house closed up with snow, 
himself awake as if he slept, living 
as if he had already died, and rich, happy 
as if he were a buried worm. 

                                           Is God, 
then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of cattle? 
Myself, I don’t like to wonder anymore. 
I only hope lifelong service earns what I ask: 
the command of some far bastion on your wall 
where it curves out into the unsettled wastes 
beyond any field, and the barrenness inside 
is indistinguishable from that without. 
This is the reward and end of life I want: 
to be a point, though infinitely small 
and far from you, in that wide circle centred 
on your great self. I see myself arriving 
to take charge of my troops. I look down from the tower: 
bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast restless 
stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast, 
the cold wind’s hissing. Year after year the same, 
waiting for an assault that never comes, 
straining to glimpse our naked enemies 
creeping blended with their stony soil: nothing 
but legend, it may be. Maybe a morning 
will rise when, waking, I find that I’ve forgotten 
which way is north, and can’t tell if I am turned 
outward to danger or inward, Highness, to you. 
The sun invisible, a murky light diffused 
throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so long 
no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight 
endlessly east and west: what clue will there be 
which way to face my people for the attack? 
It will be crucial then to show no doubt. 
My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.

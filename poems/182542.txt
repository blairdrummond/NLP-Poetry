title : Sent with a Flower-Pot Begging a Slip of Geranium

author : Christian Milne

text : 
I’ve sent my empty pot again
   To beg another slip;
The last you gave, I’m grieved to tell
   December’s frost did nip.

I love fair Flora and her train
   But nurse her children ill;
I tend too little, or too much;
   They die from want of skill.

I blush to trouble you again,
   Who’ve served me oft before;
But, should this die, I’ll break the pot,
   And trouble you no more.

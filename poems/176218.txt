title : Deeply Morbid

author : Stevie Smith

text : 
Deeply morbid deeply morbid was the girl who typed the letters 
Always out of office hours running with her social betters   
But when daylight and the darkness of the office closed about her 
Not for this ah not for this her office colleagues came to doubt her 
It was that look within her eye 
Why did it always seem to say goodbye? 

Joan her name was and at lunchtime   
Solitary solitary 
She would go and watch the pictures   
In the National Gallery 
All alone all alone 
This time with no friend beside her   
She would go and watch the pictures   
All alone. 

Will she leave her office colleagues 
Will she leave her evening pleasures 
Toil within a friendly bureau 
Running later in her leisure? 
All alone all alone 
Before the pictures she seems turned to stone. 

Close upon the Turner pictures   
Closer than a thought may go   
Hangs her eye and all the colours   
Leap into a special glow 
All for her, all alone 
All for her, all for Joan. 

First the canvas where the ocean   
Like a mighty animal 
With a really wicked motion   
Leaps for sailors’ funeral 

Holds her panting. Oh the creature   
Oh the wicked virile thing 
With its skin of fleck and shadow   
Stretching tightening over him. 
Wild yet captured wild yet captured   
By the painter, Joan is quite enraptured. 

Now she edges from the canvas   
To another loved more dearly   
Where the awful light of purest   
Sunshine falls across the spray,   
There the burning coasts of fancy   
Open to her pleasure lay. 
All alone, all alone 
Come away, come away 
All alone. 

Lady Mary, Lady Kitty 
The Honourable Featherstonehaugh   
Polly Tommy from the office 
Which of these shall hold her now?   
Come away, come away 
All alone. 

The spray reached out and sucked her in   
It was a hardly noticed thing   
That Joan was there and is not now 
(Oh go and tell young Featherstonehaugh)   
Gone away, gone away   
All alone. 

She stood up straight 
The sun fell down 
There was no more of London Town   
She went upon the painted shore   
And there she walks for ever more   
Happy quite 
Beaming bright 
In a happy happy light 
All alone. 

They say she was a morbid girl, no doubt of it   
And what befell her clearly grew out of it   
But I say she’s a lucky one 
To walk for ever in that sun 
And as I bless sweet Turner’s name 
I wish that I could do the same.

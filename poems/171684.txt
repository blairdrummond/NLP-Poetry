title : My Shoes

author : Charles Simic

text : 
Shoes, secret face of my inner life:   
Two gaping toothless mouths, 
Two partly decomposed animal skins   
Smelling of mice nests. 

My brother and sister who died at birth   
Continuing their existence in you, 
Guiding my life 
Toward their incomprehensible innocence. 

What use are books to me 
When in you it is possible to read   
The Gospel of my life on earth 
And still beyond, of things to come? 

I want to proclaim the religion 
I have devised for your perfect humility   
And the strange church I am building   
With you as the altar. 

Ascetic and maternal, you endure: 
Kin to oxen, to Saints, to condemned men,   
With your mute patience, forming 
The only true likeness of myself.

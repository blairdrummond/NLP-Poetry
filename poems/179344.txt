title : Hullo

author : Wendy Videlock

text : 
The word, the stone,
 the ringing phone,
 the part of me
 that wants to be alone,

 the vow of silence
 in the reeds;
 God descends
 in ravenese.

 The vinegar tasters
 dip their fingers,
 make their faces:
 stoic, bitter,

 strangely sweet.
 The seeker leaves
 for Bangladesh,
 the prophets check

 for signs of theft,
 the singers sing
 for what is left.
 The children breathe.

 Come of age.
 Search the faces
 for a taste of
 what's to come:

 the widening road,
 the row your boat,
 he choked with weeds,
 the rabbit hole.

 This holding on.

 The word, the stone,
 the ringing phone.
 The part of we
 that answers when alone.

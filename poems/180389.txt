title : Pastoral

author : Bei Dao

text : 
wolves of music weave their way at a run 
hawthorns wheeze with clandestine laughter 

turning a new leaf, tide's out 
young ship-captains high up on balconies 
look far away through telescopes 

east and west 
a single fruit cut into halves 

beneath a tree grown from the pit I once spit out 
I've hung nets to 
trap birds, and waited how many years

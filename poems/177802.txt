text : 
Who knows but that Meriwether Lewis’s   
lost diaries might turn up yet 
packed in a can in some cramped ex-midden   
dug up a thousand years from now,   
that elegant, exfoliate style 
continue on up the Missouri, into sadness 
and disrepute, the suicide in a hotel in Tennessee   
no more important now than the bundle   
of grasses my friend made out in the woods   
yesterday and gave to me after a meeting   
in which she confessed she’s afraid of everything   
that’s coming. The past I don’t mind, she said,   
and laughed as if that was something.

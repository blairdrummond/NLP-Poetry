title : Winter Journal: Wind Thumbs through Woods

author : Emily Wilson

text : 
slant hand of beech leaves 
shag of oaks before water 
When did you go missing from me? 
That passage between limb and slipped skin 
gouged hickories, the ermine-bright birch 
through all that is traveling slopeward 
       circleting leaf through branch weave 
       corymbs of curled leaves 
       lone cedar document rising 
Through trees that far land moves descant 
the old rusts and pastes undershined 
Don’t you ever think this is so strange? 
the sibilant drift of dried leaves 
the coming down all to some shambles 
the encroachments on the innermost things 
Don’t you feel how everything is strained beyond 
       certain remembering? 
The limbs break their fragile whisks into 
The sky is a shroud pulled up over 
Each leaf of the beech has its wisdom held fast 
its little death ship 
I cannot wake up from inside 
       this burrow into fundaments of leaves 
The cold drills down into the stone 
the almost-extracted green 
the bird cloaked up under the ribs 
the dull gleams

title : Where They Lived

author : Marjorie Saiser

text : 
One last time I unlock 
the house where they lived 

and fought and tried again: 
the air of the place, 

carpet with its unchanging green, 
chair with its back to me. 

On the TV set, the Christmas cactus 
has bloomed, has spilled its pink flowers 

down its scraggly arms 
and died, drying into paper. 

At the round oak table, 
ghosts lean toward one another, 

almost a bow, before rising, 
before ambling away.

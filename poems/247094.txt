title : The Immigrant's Song

text : 
Let us not speak of those days 
when coffee beans filled the morning 
with hope, when our mothers' headscarves 
hung like white flags on washing lines. 
Let us not speak of the long arms of sky 
that used to cradle us at dusk. 
And the baobabs—let us not trace 
the shape of their leaves in our dreams, 
or yearn for the noise of those nameless birds 
that sang and died in the church's eaves. 
Let us not speak of men, 
stolen from their beds at night. 
Let us not say the word
                                            disappeared.
Let us not remember the first smell of rain. 
Instead, let us speak of our lives now—
the gates and bridges and stores.
And when we break bread
in cafés and at kitchen tables
with our new brothers,
let us not burden them with stories
of war or abandonment.
Let us not name our old friends
who are unravelling like fairy tales
in the forests of the dead.
Naming them will not bring them back.
Let us stay here, and wait for the future
to arrive, for grandchildren to speak
in forked tongues about the country
we once came from.
Tell us about it, they might ask.
And you might consider telling them 
of the sky and the coffee beans, 
the small white houses and dusty streets. 
You might set your memory afloat 
like a paper boat down a river. 
You might pray that the paper 
whispers your story to the water, 
that the water sings it to the trees, 
that the trees howl and howl 
it to the leaves. If you keep still 
and do not speak, you might hear 
your whole life fill the world 
until the wind is the only word.

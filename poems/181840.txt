title : Tiger Butter

author : Diane Glancy

text : 
Is it only when you’re little 
you know tigers live in your closet— 
one with your shoes on his two ears, 
another with your umbrella tied to his tail; 
the rest wearing your red coat 
and blue trousers with the red buttons? 
Is it only when you’re little 
the dustballs have mountainous shadows 
in the crack of light under the door? 
Or is it also NOW you fear that tigers will eat you— 
when you wake in the middle of the night 
and don’t know where you are, 
nor remember how far you’ve come. 
Your nose hurts like a plowed field, 
your fingers stiff— 
Then somehow, you remember what you’ve accomplished. 
The sewing is finished— 
The red buttons threaded to the blue pants 
and the little coat with its sleeves. 
And you know you have given them to the tigers 
(so they won’t eat you). 
But they chased themselves around a tree 
and melted into butter. 
NOW you can pick up your coat and trousers, 
your shoes and umbrella. 
Soon, even, you can start your car and go— 
The promise of dawn already 
on the face 
of the clock-radio.

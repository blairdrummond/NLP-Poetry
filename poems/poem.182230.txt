The Place for No Story

Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals



The coast hills at Sovranes Creek; 
No trees, but dark scant pasture drawn thin 
Over rock shaped like flame; 
The old ocean at the land's foot, the vast 
Gray extension beyond the long white violence; 
A herd of cows and the bull 
Far distant, hardly apparent up the dark slope; 
And the gray air haunted with hawks: 
This place is the noblest thing I have ever seen. No imaginable 
Human presence here could do anything 
But dilute the lonely self-watchful passion.

As you came from the holy land
         Of Walsingham,
Met you not with my true love
         By the way as you came?

   "How shall I know your true love,
         That have met many one,
I went to the holy land,
         That have come, that have gone?"

   She is neither white, nor brown,
         But as the heavens fair;
There is none hath a form so divine
         In the earth, or the air.

"Such a one did I meet, good sir,
         Such an angelic face,
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear
         By her gait, by her grace."

She hath left me here all alone,
         All alone, as unknown,
Who sometimes did me lead with herself,
         And me loved as her own.

"What's the cause that she leaves you alone,
         And a new way doth take,
Who loved you once as her own,
         And her joy did you make?"

I have lov'd her all my youth;
         But now old, as you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
         From the withered tree.

Know that Love is a careless child,
         And forgets promise past;
He is blind, he is deaf when he list,
         And in faith never fast.

His desire is a dureless content,
         And a trustless joy:
He is won with a world of despair,
         And is lost with a toy.

Of womenkind such indeed is the love,
         Or the word love abus'd,
Under which many childish desires
         And conceits are excus'd.

But true love is a durable fire,
         In the mind ever burning,
Never sick, never old, never dead,
         From itself never turning.

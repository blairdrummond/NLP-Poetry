title : He Said Turn Here

text : 
and then Tony showed us the lake 
where he had thrown some of his sadness last summer   
and it had dissolved like powder   
so he thought maybe the lake could take   
some of the radiant, aluminum kind   
he had been making lately. 
And it did. 
It was a perfect lake, 
none of the paint had chipped off, 
no bolts showing, the arms that Dante   
and Virgil would have to hack through   
not even breaking the surface.   
Mumbling Italian to itself, 
it had climbed down two wooden stairs 
back to the beach now that the rains were done. 
How strange to be water so close to the ocean 
yet the only other water you get to talk to   
comes from the sky. Maybe this is why   
it seems so willing to take on 
Tony’s sadness which sometimes corrodes   
his friends, which is really 
many different sadnesses, smaller   
and smaller, surrounded by more   
and more space, each a world and   
at its core an engine like a bee   
inside a lily, like buzzing inside   
the bee. It seems like nothing   
could change its color although   
we couldn’t tell what color it was,   
it kept changing. In the summer, 
Tony says he comes down early each day 
and there’s no one around so the lake 
barely says a thing when he dives in 
and once when his kitchen was on fire in Maine   
and he was asleep, the lake came and bit his hand,   
trying to drag him to safety   
and some nights in New Mexico,   
he can hear it howling, 
searching for him in the desert   
so we’re glad Tony has this lake 
and we promise to come back in August 
and swim with him across,   
maybe even race.

Scintillas of the anatomical
 on the vines, buds opening—
 make me a figure 
 for the woken.
  
 On the vines, buds opening—
 blue, little throats.
 For the woken,
 this different tin sky.
  
 Blue, little throats
 speak to me in the right voice.
 This different tin sky,
 the playground thawing.
  
 Speak to me in the right voice,
 only clean, sweeter.
 The playground thawing
 into its primary colors.
  
 Only clean, sweeter,
 briary as honeysuckle,
 into their primary colors
 the words come: bitter, astral.
  
 Briar—as honeysuckle,
 as attic webs, constellated
 into their primary colors.
 White, or whiter.
  
 The words comes: bitter, astral.
 Make me a figure,
 blue little throats, 
 scintillas of the anatomical.

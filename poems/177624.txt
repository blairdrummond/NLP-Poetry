Here is a genial congregation, 
well fed and rosy with health and appetite, 
robust children in tow. They have come 
and all the generations of them, to be fed, 
their old ones too who are eligible now 
for a small discount, having lived to a ripe age. 
Over the heaped and steaming plates, one by one, 
heads bow, eyes close; the blessings are said. 

Here there is good will; here peace 
on earth, among the leafy greens, among the fruits 
of the gardens of America's heartland. Here is abundance, 
here is the promised 
land of milk and honey, out of which 
a flank of the fatted calf, thick still 
on its socket and bone, rises like a benediction 
over the loaves of bread and the little fishes, belly-up in butter.

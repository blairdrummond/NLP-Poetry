text : 
There are times when all the chutzpa I 
can muster isn't enough, fug and bluster 
all I can do, and damned if it doesn't 
just stand there, legs straddling 
a berm of washboard dust-ruts 
and in late noon sun stare me 
blue in the face: lord, we could almost 
trade places, my back strained 
by the weight of those great bone wings, 
my tongue itching for lily root. 
And musk, lord, the pheromones, 
a day so sweet with elderberry's too rank 
fume I could die twice over snuffing. 
While the truck mumbles and a trout spanks 
the cooler, I almost outdo myself. 
But reason, that too-convenient shortcut, 
creeps back, if only so far: the rest as we say 
is silence, dust and the sputter of flies 
and when lumbering to go it pauses 
and throws me its last worst look 
its sorrow is Christ's, dewlap 
jeweled, a beatitude of moss.

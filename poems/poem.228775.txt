Rhymed Stanza, Series/Sequence

Calm is the morn without a sound, 
         Calm as to suit a calmer grief, 
         And only thro' the faded leaf 
The chestnut pattering to the ground: 

Calm and deep peace on this high wold, 
         And on these dews that drench the furze. 
         And all the silvery gossamers 
That twinkle into green and gold: 

Calm and still light on yon great plain 
         That sweeps with all its autumn bowers, 
         And crowded farms and lessening towers, 
To mingle with the bounding main: 

Calm and deep peace in this wide air, 
         These leaves that redden to the fall; 
         And in my heart, if calm at all, 
If any calm, a calm despair: 

Calm on the seas, and silver sleep, 
         And waves that sway themselves in rest, 
         And dead calm in that noble breast 
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.

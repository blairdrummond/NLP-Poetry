Sonnet

Not marble nor the gilded monuments 
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, 
But you shall shine more bright in these contents 
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time. 
When wasteful war shall statues overturn, 
And broils root out the work of masonry, 
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn 
The living record of your memory. 
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity 
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room 
Even in the eyes of all posterity 
That wear this world out to the ending doom. 
    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise, 
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

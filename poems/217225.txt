title : For Micha's Mother, Who Signs

author : Robert A. Fink

text : 
It is not poetry you fear, but poets, 
their indelible brand 
of words. How will your daughter 
escape the mark men hanged 
young women for in Salem? 
I am nothing more than a teacher, 
like you. See, I have removed 
my shoes and socks. I am rolling 
my trousers above my ankles. 
No cloven hooves. Long feet and toes 
like you and your beautiful daughter. 

It is language that has won 
her over, earth-bound words 
walking orderly across the page 
like children holding to 
the rope attached to your wrist, 
teacher and students 
traversing the noisy street 
at the crosswalk, with the light 
of your fingers composing 
the line your children read, 
each syllable's afterimage trailing 
your quick passage of hands 
conducting the boys and girls 
safely from one curb to the other.

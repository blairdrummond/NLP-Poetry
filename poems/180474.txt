title : The Pump

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
There was always a lizard 
Or a frog around the pump, 
Waiting for a little extra water 
Or a butterfly to light. 

Jimmy said the pump gave him the worms. 
I got the worms under the slick boards. 
The pump would bite you in the winter. 
It got hold of Jimmy and wouldnâ€™t let go. 

The blades of Johnson grass were tall 
And sharp around the pump stand. 
I had to hoe them all the time 
Nobody filled the prime jar, though. 

One time, I cut the tongue 
Out of a Buster Brown shoe 
And gave it to the pump. 
It made a good sucker washer. 

Sometimes the pump seemed like Jesus. 
I liked bathing buck naked 
Under the pump, 
Not in a goddamn washtub.

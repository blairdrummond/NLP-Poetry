For old Billy Dugan, shot in the ass in the Civil War, my father said.
The old wound in my ass 
has opened up again, but I 
am past the prodigies
of youth’s campaigns, and weep
where I used to laugh
in war’s red humors, half
in love with silly-assed pains
and half not feeling them. 
I have to sit up with 
an indoor unsittable itch 
before I go down late
and weeping to the storm-
cellar on a dirty night
and go to bed with the worms.
So pull the dirt up over me 
and make a family joke 
for Old Billy Blue Balls,
the oldest private in the world
with two ass-holes and no
place more to go to for a laugh
except the last one. Say:
The North won the Civil War
without much help from me 
although I wear a proof 
of the war’s obscenity.

Couplet

The nicest child I ever knew 
Was Charles Augustus Fortescue. 
He never lost his cap, or tore 
His stockings or his pinafore: 
   In eating Bread he made no Crumbs, 
   He was extremely fond of sums, 
To which, however, he preferred 
The Parsing of a Latin Word-- 
He sought, when it was within his power, 
For information twice an hour, 
And as for finding Mutton-Fat 
Unappatising, far from that! 
He often, at his Father's Board, 
Would beg them, of his own accord, 
To give him, if they did not mind, 
The Greasiest Morsels they could find-- 
His Later Years did not belie 
The Promise of his Infancy. 
   In Public Life he always tried 
   To take a judgement Broad and Wide; 
In Private, none was more than he 
Renowned for quiet courtesy. 
He rose at once in his Career, 
And long before his Fortieth Year 
Had wedded Fifi, Only Child 
Of Bunyan, First Lord Aberfylde. 
He thus became immensely Rich, 
And built the Splendid Mansion which 
Is called The Cedars, Muswell Hill, 
Where he resides in affluence still, 
To show what everybody might 
Become by SIMPLY DOING RIGHT.

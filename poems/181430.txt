When the mule balked, he hit him 
sometimes with the flat of a hand 
upside the head; more often 
the stick he carried did its angry trick. 
The mule’s job was to power the press, 
iron on iron that wrung the sugar 
out of cane, circling under the coarse 
beam attached to his shoulders and neck. 
That mule of my childhood 
was black, remained blackly obedient 
as round and round he made himself 
the splintered hand of a clock, the groan 
and squeak of machinery chewing 
the reedy stalks to pulp, each second 
delivering another sweet thin drop 
into the black pot at the center. 

He hit him with a rag, old headrag, 
but the animal winced only with the thrash 
of a cane stalk itself—he squinted 
under the rule of that bamboo. 
The sun was another caning 
on his black-hot flesh. He was slow 
as the blackstrap syrup the boiled sugar made, 
so true to the circle he dragged 
we hardly saw him. We loved the rustling 
house of green cane, blind in that field 
of tropical grasses whose white plumes 
announced the long season’s wait. 
We yearned for the six-foot stem, the eventual 
six pieces the machete sliced 
at the joints, then the woody exterior 
peeled back lengthwise with a blade. 
It was a black hand we waited for, his job 
to lay bare the grainy fiber we chewed. 
That juice on our tongues 
was his sweetness at work. 
Chester was his name, he kept the mule.

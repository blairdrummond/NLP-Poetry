Kind Are Her Answers

Love, Infatuation & Crushes, Unrequited Love, Break-ups & Vexed Love



   Kind are her answers,
   But her performance keeps no day;
   Breaks time, as dancers
   From their own music when they stray:
   All her free favors
And smooth words wing my hopes in vain.
O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
   Can true love yield such delay,
   Converting joy to pain?

   Lost is our freedom,
   When we submit to women so:
   Why do we need 'em,
   When in their best they work our woe?
   There is no wisdom
Can alter ends, by Fate prefixed.
O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
   Never were days yet called two,
   But one night went betwixt.

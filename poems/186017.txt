title : Nothing to Do

author : James Ephraim McGirt

text : 
The fields are white;
   The laborers are few;
Yet say the idle:
   There’s nothing to do.

Jails are crowded;
   In Sunday-schools few;
We still complain:
   There’s nothing to do.

Drunkards are dying—
   Your sons, it is true;
Mothers’ arms folded
   With nothing to do.

Heathens are dying;
   Their blood falls on you;
How can you people
   Find nothing to do?

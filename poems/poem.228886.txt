Rhymed Stanza

I walk'd the other day, to spend my hour, 
       Into a field, 
Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield 
       A gallant flow'r; 
But winter now had ruffled all the bow'r 
       And curious store 
       I knew there heretofore. 

Yet I, whose search lov'd not to peep and peer 
       I' th' face of things, 
Thought with my self, there might be other springs 
       Besides this here, 
Which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year; 
       And so the flow'r 
       Might have some other bow'r. 

Then taking up what I could nearest spy, 
       I digg'd about 
That place where I had seen him to grow out; 
       And by and by 
I saw the warm recluse alone to lie, 
       Where fresh and green 
       He liv'd of us unseen. 

Many a question intricate and rare 
       Did I there strow; 
But all I could extort was, that he now 
       Did there repair 
Such losses as befell him in this air, 
       And would ere long 
       Come forth most fair and young. 

This past, I threw the clothes quite o'er his head; 
       And stung with fear 
Of my own frailty dropp'd down many a tear 
       Upon his bed; 
Then sighing whisper'd, "happy are the dead! 
       What peace doth now 
       Rock him asleep below!" 

And yet, how few believe such doctrine springs 
       From a poor root, 
Which all the winter sleeps here under foot, 
       And hath no wings 
To raise it to the truth and light of things; 
       But is still trod 
       By ev'ry wand'ring clod. 

O Thou! whose spirit did at first inflame 
       And warm the dead, 
And by a sacred incubation fed 
       With life this frame, 
Which once had neither being, form, nor name; 
       Grant I may so 
       Thy steps track here below, 

That in these masques and shadows I may see 
       Thy sacred way; 
And by those hid ascents climb to that day, 
       Which breaks from Thee, 
Who art in all things, though invisibly! 
       Shew me thy peace, 
       Thy mercy, love, and ease, 

And from this care, where dreams and sorrows reign, 
       Lead me above, 
Where light, joy, leisure, and true comforts move 
       Without all pain; 
There, hid in thee, shew me his life again, 
       At whose dumb urn 
       Thus all the year I mourn.

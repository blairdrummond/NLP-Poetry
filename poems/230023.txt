title : Danse Russe

author : William Carlos Williams

text : 
If I when my wife is sleeping 
and the baby and Kathleen 
are sleeping 
and the sun is a flame-white disc 
in silken mists 
above shining trees,— 
if I in my north room 
dance naked, grotesquely 
before my mirror 
waving my shirt round my head 
and singing softly to myself: 
“I am lonely, lonely. 
I was born to be lonely, 
I am best so!” 
If I admire my arms, my face, 
my shoulders, flanks, buttocks 
against the yellow drawn shades,— 

Who shall say I am not 
the happy genius of my household?

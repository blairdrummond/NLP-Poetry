How fares it with the happy dead? 
         For here the man is more and more; 
         But he forgets the days before 
God shut the doorways of his head. 

The days have vanish'd, tone and tint, 
         And yet perhaps the hoarding sense 
         Gives out at times (he knows not whence) 
A little flash, a mystic hint; 

And in the long harmonious years 
         (If Death so taste Lethean springs), 
         May some dim touch of earthly things 
Surprise thee ranging with thy peers. 

If such a dreamy touch should fall, 
         O turn thee round, resolve the doubt; 
         My guardian angel will speak out 
In that high place, and tell thee all.

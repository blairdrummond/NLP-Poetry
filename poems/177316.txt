title : Poem to Some of My Recent Poems

author : James Tate

text : 
My beloved little billiard balls, 
my polite mongrels, edible patriotic plums,   
you owe your beauty to your mother, who   
resembled a cyclindrical corned beef   
with all the trimmings, may God rest   
her forsaken soul, for it is all of us   
she forsook; and I shall never forget 
her sputtering embers, and then the little mound. 
Yes, my little rum runners, she had defective   
tear ducts and could weep only iced tea.   
She had petticoats beneath her eyelids.   
And in her last years she found ball bearings   
in her beehive puddings, she swore allegiance   
to Abyssinia. What should I have done?   
I played the piano and scrambled eggs.   
I had to navigate carefully around her brain’s   
avalanche lest even a decent finale be forfeited. 
And her beauty still evermore. You see, 
as she was dying, I led each of you to her side, 
one by one she scorched you with her radiance. 
And she is ever with us in our acetylene leisure. 
But you are beautiful, and I, a slave to a heap of cinders.

title : I’ll Open the Window

author : Anna Swir

text : 
Our embrace lasted too long. 
We loved right down to the bone.   
I hear the bones grind, I see   
our two skeletons. 

Now I am waiting 
till you leave, till 
the clatter of your shoes 
is heard no more. Now, silence. 

Tonight I am going to sleep alone   
on the bedclothes of purity. 
Aloneness 
is the first hygienic measure.   
Aloneness 
will enlarge the walls of the room,   
I will open the window 
and the large, frosty air will enter,   
healthy as tragedy. 
Human thoughts will enter 
and human concerns, 
misfortune of others, saintliness of others.   
They will converse softly and sternly. 

Do not come anymore.   
I am an animal   
very rarely.

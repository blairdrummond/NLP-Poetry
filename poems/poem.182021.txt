The Cats Will Know 
Cesare Pavese 
1908-1950

Italy




Rain will fall again 
on your smooth pavement, 
a light rain like 
a breath or a step. 
The breeze and the dawn 
will flourish again 
when you return, 
as if beneath your step. 
Between flowers and sills 
the cats will know. 

There will be other days, 
there will be other voices. 
You will smile alone. 
The cats will know. 
You will hear words 
old and spent and useless 
like costumes left over 
from yesterday's parties. 

You too will make gestures. 
You'll answer with words-- 
face of springtime, 
you too will make gestures. 

The cats will know, 
face of springtime; 
and the light rain 
and the hyacinth dawn 
that wrench the heart of him 
who hopes no more for you-- 
they are the sad smile 
you smile by yourself. 

There will be other days, 
other voices and renewals. 
Face of springtime, 
we will suffer at daybreak.

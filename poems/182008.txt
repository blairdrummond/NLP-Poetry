title : The Exorcism

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
It was homemade and primitive,   
like pulling a tooth with a string 
and a slamming door, like taking out 
an appendix by kerosene light 
where dogs wandered in and out 
the dirt-floored room. 
Nothing for the pain that 
everyone wanted to examine,   
the twisted heart they thought 
they could shout back into place. 

Moaning and fluttering their fleshy hands 
on the wind, on the wail of the soul possessed,   
they certified her in a manner Inquisitional,   
frantic when she held to the grip of darkness,   
grimly determined to wait the thing out,   
something learned from movie sheriffs,   
white hats ghostly in the moonlight. 

When she would not answer (though they 
conjured her by heaven and by the all 
mighty names they knew), they laid hands 
on her and shouted down the well of her eyes. 
Many tongues twisted in their mouths when 
she went, leaving behind only   
the smallest tooth of wickedness.

title : Planting the Sand Cherry

author : Ann Struthers

Today I planted the sand cherry with red leaves—   
and hope that I can go on digging in this yard,   
pruning the grape vine, twisting the silver lace   
on its trellis, the one that bloomed   
just before the frost flowered over all the garden.   
Next spring I will plant more zinnias, marigolds,   
straw flowers, pearly everlasting, and bleeding heart.   
I plant that for you, old love, old friend,   
and lilacs for remembering.   The lily-of-the-valley    
with cream-colored bells, bent over slightly, bowing   
to the inevitable, flowers for a few days, a week.   
Now its broad blade leaves are streaked with brown   
and the stem dried to a pale hair.   
In place of the silent bells, red berries   
like rose hips blaze close to the ground.   
It is important for me to be down on my knees,   
my fingers sifting the black earth,   
making those things grow which will grow.   
Sometimes I save a weed if its leaves   
are spread fern-like, hand-like,   
or if it grows with a certain impertinence.   
I let the goldenrod stay and the wild asters.   
I save the violets in spring.   People who kill violets   
will do anything.

I.
  
 Dusk, thus:
 a shirt drops,
  
 the bellybutton rune
 showing.
  
 Clouds are soaked,
 the sea now
  
 iron, muscle-heavy.
 The pond begins
  
 reflecting on astronomy.
 The fruit wait.
  
 The furniture
 call back their atoms.
  
 The tree asks for
 its leaves.
  
  
 II.
  
 Winter brought into the room
 is the whisk of holly.
  
 The purse is a hare limp
 on the table, its eye
 gone amber.
  
 The birdcage is the work
 I am after: bold-barred,
 so no bird leaves.
  
 The celadon throat, the iceberg
 teeth, the matted grass
 of an armpit . . .
   
 A pear, or maybe a stone,
 the chilled shoulder shifts under
 cover, not persuaded
 into similitude.
  
  
 III.
  
 In the snail-tracked sky,
 the mineral grains, a dozen eyes.
  
 You tell me thread
 is for seam and hem, not the mica
 bead-stitched on the dark.
  
 You refuse to have the shards
 the broom gathered
 be the moon, seen as aftermath.
  
 But like the thimble, I have no guile.
  
 So let your window
 open to the rain coming down,
 drumming on the hidden shells.
  
  
 IV.
  
 Black cherries.
 Glass of milk on a tablecloth.
 An arm of bread.
  
 The coins.
 Green scarab beetle.
 The compact’s sleeping mirror.
  
 The fig branch.
 The sundial.
 The harlequin leaves.
  
  
 V. 
  
 Votive-light evening,
 cipher ridden.
  
 The marsh air, and my finger
 in places.
  
 Among the lesser constellations,
 the fractured
  
 kite, the anemone.
 The geese thread-pulled
  
 into the hard sleep.
 The clothespin, the gold
  
 in your hair.
 The seeds spread
  
 are a flung field.
 I sleep on stone, you on moss.
  
  
 VI.
  
 The red-haired figure
 in the station, the man selling
 carnations. The scarecrow
  
 landscape, the suitcases
 getting heavier with every stop.
 Those served as props.
  
 I dreamed we each played a part.
  
 One of us was given to say:
 I wanted your distance whispered down
 small enough for this room.
  
 And one to say:
 I saw you always just a little
 out of reach, with white hair.
  
  
 VII.
  
 A fish-scale moon:
 who doesn’t want

to be left used
 windsock-hollow?
  
 Now for morning:
 the lit wick
  
 of each grass-blade,
 the saplings
  
 like legs of deer,
 the four walls
  
 verifying the house,
 and the slip
  
 of last night’s chive
 in your teeth.

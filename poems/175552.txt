The Reverse
Studious of Ease, and fond of humble Things, 
Below the Smiles, below the Frowns of Kings: 
Thanks to my Stars, I prize the Sweets of Life, 
No sleepless Nights I count, no Days of Strife. 
I rest, I wake, I drink, I sometimes love, 
I read, I write, I settle, or I rove; 
Content to live, content to die unknown, 
Lord of myself, accountable to none.

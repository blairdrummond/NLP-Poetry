title : You

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
Sometimes in our sleep we touch 
The body of another woman 
And we wake up 
And we know the first nights 
With summer visitors 
In the three storied house of our childhood. 
Whatever we remember, 
The darkest hair being brushed 
In front of the darkest mirror 
In the darkest room.

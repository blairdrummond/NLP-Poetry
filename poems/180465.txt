title : Friend of the Enemy

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
The yolk went down my leg 
Like a beautiful snail without a shell, 
Went down the hill 
To the skillet of water, to the nymphflies, 
Into the lips of pond minnows, 
Down the long belly of the gar â€“ the hellbenders 
Having dived and lost, then into 
The paw of the lame panther 
Who loped back to her lair with it. 
As for the white, it stayed with me, 
Mark of the beast, birth, and trade.

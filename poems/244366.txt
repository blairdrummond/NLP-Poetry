title : The History of Red

First
 there was some other order of things
 never spoken
 but in dreams of darkest creation.
  
 Then there was black earth,
 lake, the face of light on water.
 Then the thick forest all around
 that light,
 and then the human clay
 whose blood we still carry
 rose up in us
 who remember caves with red bison
 painted in their own blood,
 after their kind.
  
 A wildness
 swam inside our mothers,
 desire through closed eyes,
 a new child
 wearing the red, wet mask of birth,
 delivered into this land
 already wounded,
 stolen and burned
 beyond reckoning.
  
 Red is this yielding land
 turned inside out
 by a country of hunters
 with iron, flint and fire.
 Red is the fear
 that turns a knife back
 against men, holds it at their throats,
 and they cannot see the claw on the handle,
 the animal hand
 that haunts them
 from some place inside their blood.
  
 So that is hunting, birth,
 and one kind of death.
 Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.
 Red was the infinite fruit
 of stolen bodies.
 The doctors wanted to know
 what invented disease
 how wounds healed
 from inside themselves
 how life stands up in skin,
 if not by magic.
  
 They divined the red shadows of leeches
 that swam in white bowls of water:
 they believed stars
 in the cup of sky.
 They cut the wall of skin
 to let
 what was bad escape
 but they were reading the story of fire
 gone out
 and that was a science.
  
 As for the animal hand on death’s knife,
 knives have as many sides
 as the red father of war
 who signs his name
 in the blood of other men.
  
 And red was the soldier
 who crawled
 through a ditch
 of human blood in order to live.
 It was the canal of his deliverance.
 It is his son who lives near me.
 Red is the thunder in our ears
 when we meet.
 Love, like creation,
 is some other order of things.
  
 Red is the share of fire
 I have stolen
 from root, hoof, fallen fruit.
 And this was hunger.
  
 Red is the human house
 I come back to at night
 swimming inside the cave of skin
 that remembers bison.
 In that round nation
 of blood
 we are all burning,
 red, inseparable fires
 the living have crawled
 and climbed through 
in order to live
 so nothing will be left
 for death at the end.
  
 This life in the fire, I love it.
 I want it,
 this life.

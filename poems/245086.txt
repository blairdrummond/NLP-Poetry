title : Robinson Walks Museum Mile

text : 
the ideal city building itself in his brain.
 Is this mile magnificent? He’s lived here
  
 a while, but the mile feels unreal. Robinson’s
 training himself to act blasé. Do museums
  
 amuse me? Yes, but not today. Would he
 like to be in one? Of course. Why not?
  
 An object of value with canvas wings,
 an unchanging face in a gilt frame, arranged—
  
 thoughtless, guilt-free, & preserved
 for eternity. Robinson doesn’t want to be
  
 exceptional. He knows he is. He wants to be
 perceived exceptional. Trains plunge by, steam
  
 rising from the grates. Sing, muse! of a man
 ill-met at the Met. A man on his lunch break,
  
 heading for a heartbreak, a break-up with Time.
 A break-up with time? Feeling filled with ice,
  
 the way you chill a glass, Robinson passes
 the National Academy. He craves a sense
  
 of belonging, not to always be longing. To be
 standing in a doorway, incredibly kissable,
  
 not waiting at the four-way, eminently missable.
 Is this mile magnanimous? He wants it
  
 unanimous: that this is his kind of town—
 up & down & including Brooklyn. The sky
  
 is clearing, but the isolation sticks.
 Robinson’s not sure what a camera obscura
  
 is for, but he thinks he should have
 his portrait done with one. Faces
  
 blur by as he heads toward the Frick.
 Something used to photograph the obscure.

title : One Cow, Two Moos

author : J. Patrick Lewis

text : 
We used to have a single cow,
We called her Mrs. Rupple. 
But she got struck by a lightning bolt,
And now we have a couple. 

She's walking sort of funny now,
Oh pity her poor calf. 
Old Mrs. Rupple gives no milk,
She gives us half-and-half.

title : Grandmother Speaks of the Old Country

author : Lola Haskins

text : 
That year there were many deaths in the village. 
Germs flew like angels from one house to the next 
and every family gave up its own. Mothers 
died at their mending. Children fell at school. 
Of three hundred twenty, there were eleven left. 
Then, quietly, the sun set on a day when no one 
died. And the angels whispered among themselves. 
And that evening, as he sat on the stone steps, 
your grandfather felt a small wind on his neck 
when all the trees were still. And he would tell us 
always, how he had felt that night, on the skin 
of his own neck, the angels, passing.

author : Minnesota Ice Train J. P. White

text : 
Some men who are at least fifty-five 
wake up in the night to touch their sex 
like patting the family dog on the head. 
Others rise to pace the square of   their den 
as if  called to guard duty. Still others 
peer back at me from their bedroom windows 
as if  on lookout for some lost shipment 
to arrive from Bitterroot, Montana. 

I uncurl in bed listening for the 3 AM train 
to whip through Wayzata, hugging the lake 
so close I imagine it could skip the hot rails 
and skid across the ancestral ice toward me, 
an ice train come to ferry me home or away 
from my encircling command or back to some 
earlier time when I too was more fiercely 
racing the night, my body clamorous thumping, 
the windows rattling, the length of me 
moon-drenched, snow falling, sparks raking 
my wheels, one more town flown through.

title : Banana Trees

author : Joseph Stanton

text : 
They are tall herbs, really, not trees, 
though they can shoot up thirty feet 
if all goes well for them. Cut in cross 

section they look like gigantic onions, 
multi-layered mysteries with ghostly hearts. 
Their leaves are made to be broken by the wind, 

if wind there be, but the crosswise tears 
they are built to expect do them no harm. 
Around the steady staff of the leafstalk 

the broken fronds flap in the breeze 
like brief forgotten flags, but these 
tattered, green, photosynthetic machines 

know how to grasp with their broken fingers 
the gold coins of light that give open air 
its shine. In hot, dry weather the fingers 

fold down to touch on each side-- 
a kind of prayer to clasp what damp they can 
against the too much light.

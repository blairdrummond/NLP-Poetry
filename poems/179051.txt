title : Dancers Exercising

author : Amy Clampitt

text : 
Frame within frame, the evolving conversation   
is dancelike, as though two could play   
at improvising snowflakes’ 
six-feather-vaned evanescence, 
no two ever alike. All process 
and no arrival: the happier we are, 
the less there is for memory to take hold of,   
or—memory being so largely a predilection   
for the exceptional—come to a halt   
in front of. But finding, one evening   
on a street not quite familiar, 
inside a gated 
November-sodden garden, a building   
of uncertain provenance, 
peering into whose vestibule we were   
arrested—a frame within a frame,   
a lozenge of impeccable clarity— 
by the reflection, no, not 
of our two selves, but of 
dancers exercising in a mirror, 
at the center 
of that clarity, what we saw 
was not stillness 
but movement: the perfection 
of memory consisting, it would seem,   
in the never-to-be-completed. 
We saw them mirroring themselves,   
never guessing the vestibule 
that defined them, frame within frame,   
contained two other mirrors.

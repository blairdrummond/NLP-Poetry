text : 
This prairie holds us 
with its plainness. 
An ugly wife. 
We would not stay but children comfort us 
and we need this flatness. 

On our table 
a carp with a tumor 
on its lip, 
larva eating its side. 

An old man laughs, 
one silver tooth 
in his head 
like a galvanized 
watertank. 

We are driven back 
into the land, 
our raccoon faces 
banded around the eyes 
with motorcycle goggles. 
Every car we had 
rusting in the yard. 

We saddle the buffalo 
and say we are captives. 
This barrenness holds 
us down like a wife.

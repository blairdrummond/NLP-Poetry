title : Honorary Jew

author : John Repp

text : 
The first year, I grated potatoes, chopped onions 
& watched. The second year, I fed all but the eggs 

into the machine & said I'll do the latkes & did, 
my pile of crisp delights borne to the feast by the wife 

who baffled me, our books closed, banter hushed,   
money useless in the apartment—house, my in-laws called it, 

new-wave thump at one end, ganja reek at the other— 
in which she'd knelt to tell the no one who listened 

no more no      no more no     a three-year-old mouthing 
the essential prayer. The uncle made rich by a song 

stacked three & dug in, talking critics & Koch— 
everyone crunching now, slathering applesauce, slurping tea— 

talking Rabin & Mehitabel, radio & Durrell, 
how a song is a poem or it isn't a song 

& vice-versa. Done, he pointed a greasy finger 
at me, said You can't be a goy. You—I say it 

for all to hear—are an honorary Jew!  
which, impossible dream, my latkes lived up to 

for five more years. Then the wailing.   
Then the dust.

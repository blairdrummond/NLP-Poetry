title : The Pilot in the Jungle

I 

Machine stitched rivets ravel on a tree 
Whose name he does not know. Left in the sky,   
He dangles from a silken cumulus 
(Stork’s bundle upside down 
On the delivering wind) and sees unborn   
Incredible jungles of the lizard’s eye: 
Dark fern, dark river, a shale coliseum   
Mountained above one smudgepot in the trees   
That was his surreal rug on metered skies   
And slid afire into this fourth dimension   
Whose infinite point of meeting parallels   
He marks in ultra-space, suspended from   
The chords of fifty centuries 
Descending to their past—a ripping sound   
That snags him limb by limb. He tears and falls   
Louder than any fruit dropped from the trees,   
And finds himself in mud on hands and knees. 


II 

The opened buckle frees him from his times.   
He walks three paces dressed in dripping fleece   
And tears it off. The great bird of his chute   
Flaps in the trees: he salvages its hide 
And starts a civilization. He has a blade,   
Seventeen matches, his sheepskin, and his wits.   
Spaceman Crusoe at the wreck of time, 
He ponders unseen footprints of his fear.   
No-eyes watch his nothing deep in nowhere. 


III 

He finds the wreck (the embers of himself)   
Salvages bits of metal, bakelite, glass— 
Dials twisted from himself, his poverty. 
Three hours from time still ticking on his wrist   
The spinning bobbins of the time machine   
Jam on an afternoon of Genesis 
And flights of birds blow by like calendars   
From void to void. Did worlds die or did he?   
He studies twisted props of disbelief 
Wondering what ruin to touch. He counts his change   
(“Steady now, steady ...”) flips heads or tails and sees   
The coin fall into roots. An omen? (“Steady ...”)   
He laughs (a nerve’s slow tangling like a vine)   
Speaks to himself, shouts, listens, hears a surf   
Of echo rolling back to strand him there   
In tide pools of dead time by caves of fear,   
And enters to himself, denned in his loss,   
Tick-tick, a bloodbeat building on his wrist,   
Ratcheting down the dead teeth of a skull   
(The fossil of himself) sucked out of sight   
Past heads and tails, past vertebrae and gill   
To bedrocks out of time, with time to kill.

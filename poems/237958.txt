text : 
Mankind,

    Surrender a fancied dream of birth.
    Accept science of recent years.
    To date, Africa marks first form of man; 
    here in dust most recent proof lies.
    History here emerges bone by bone.

    Dig—dig—dig.
    May Africa reward the search
    if only through eroded bones.
    Fit them together; date them. 
    Shape the skeleton of earliest man.

    This is history.
    Sing another song in vain.
    In vain contrive a different tune.
    Dust will prevail.
    It always does.

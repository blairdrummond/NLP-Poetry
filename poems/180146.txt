title : The Crossing

author : Ruth Moose

text : 
The snail at the edge of the road   
inches forward, a trim gray finger   
of a fellow in pinstripe suit.                                 
He’s burdened by his house       
that has to follow   
where he goes.  Every inch,   
he pulls together   
all he is,                                                 
all he owns,                                                       
all he was given.                                          

The road is wide                                                       
but he is called                                                                
by something                                                      
that knows him                                                                  
on the other side.

text : 
I won’t quote a word,
 but that notable double-crossing chess game
 reveals trouble in the desert,
 trouble in the lineage, trouble in the choices,
 trouble in the allegory.
  
 What more to say about the Father of everything
 from the inevitable, suspicious, atheist
 daughter
 watching the claim made around the one—
 the beautiful, longed-for, pensive son.
  
 They are all male singletons:
 one A, one I and one One
 (undercounting various brothers
 who do not matter in the tally;
  
  
 nor enumerating most sisters,
 though they certainly existed).
  
 Single, except for the One who sent an
 androgyne messenger
 who rammed the ram into the thicket,
 who filled the curly ewe,
 who took her mewling newborn sheep.
  
 Thereupon the regime of human sacrifice
 was declared theologically finished.
 But not politically and ideologically finished.
  
 Clear enough?

title : The Medium

author : Robin Blaser

text : 
it is essentially reluctance  the language
a darkness, a friendship, tying to the real
but it is unreal

the clarity desired, a wish for true sight,
all tangling

‘you’ tried me, the everyday which 
cuaght me, turning the house

in the wind, a lovecraft  the political
was not my business  I could not look

without seeing the decay, the shit poured
on most things, by indifference, the personal

power which is simply that,     demanding a friend
take dullness out of the world  (he doesn’t know
his lousy emptiness)                      I slept
in a fire    on my book bag, one dried wing

of a white moth     the story is of a man
who lost his way in the holy wood

because the way had never been taken without
at least two friends,  one on each side,

and I believe my dream said one of the others
always led     now left to acknowledge,

he can’t breathe, the darkness bled
the white wing,     one     of the body

of the moth that moved him, of the other
wing,     the language is bereft

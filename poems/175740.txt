The large man in the Budweiser tee 
with serpents twining on his arms 
has leukemia. It doesn’t seem right 
but they’ve told him he won’t die for years 
if he sticks with the treatment. 
He’s talking about his years in the foundry, 

running a crane on an overhead track in the mill. 
Eight hours a day moving ingots into rollers. 
Sometimes without a break 
because of the bother of getting down. 
Never had an accident. 
Never hurt anyone. He had that much control. 

His problem is that electricity 
arced through his body and accumulated. 
When he got down at the end of a shift 
he could squeeze a forty-watt light bulb 
between thumb and finger and make it flare. 
All the guys came around to see that.

Is dead serious about this one, having rehearsed it for two weeks 
they bring it right into the Odd Fellows Meeting Hall. 
Riding the backs of the Trojan Women, 
In Euripides’ great wake they are swept up, 

But the women of the chorus, in black stockings and kerchiefs, 
Stand up bravely to it, shawled arms thrash 
In a foam of hysterical voices shrieking, 
Seaweed on the wet flanks of a whale, 

For each town has its Cassandra who is a little crazy, 
Wed to some mystery or other and therefore painfully sensitive, 
Wiser than anyone but no one listens to her, these days the terror 
Reaches its red claws into back ward and living room alike, 

For each town has its Andromache who is too young, 
With snub nose and children just out of school 
Even she cannot escape it, from the bombed city she is led out 
Weeping among the ambulances, 

And each community has its tart, its magical false Helen 
Or at least someone who looks like her, in all the make-up she can muster, 
The gorgeous mask of whatever quick-witted lie will keep her alive 
At least a little while longer, on the crest of the bloody wave, 

That dolorous mountain of wooden ships and water 
In whose memory the women bring us this huge gift horse, 
This raging animal of a play no one dares to look in the eye 
For fear of what’s hidden there: 

Small ragdoll figures toppling over and over 
From every skyscraper and battlement hurtling 
Men and women both, mere gristle in the teeth of fate. 
Out over the sea of the audience our numb faces 

Are stunned as Andromache’s, locked up there on the platform 
Inside Euripides’ machine the women sway and struggle 
One foot at a time, up the surging ladder 
Of grief piled on grief, strophe on antistrophe, 

In every century the same, the master tightens the screws, 
Heightens the gloss of each bitter scene 
And strikes every key, each word rings out 
Over our terrified heads like a brass trumpet, 

For this gift is an accordion, the biggest and mightiest of all, 
As the glittering lacquered box heaves in and out, 
Sigh upon sigh, at the topmost pitch a child 
Falls through midnight in his frantically pink skin. 

As the anguished queen protests, the citizens in the chorus wail 
Louder and louder, the warriors depart 
Without a glance backwards, these captains of the world’s death 
Enslaved as they are enslavers, in a rain of willess atoms 

anonymity takes over utterly: as the flaming city falls 
On this bare beach, in the drab pinewood hall 
The Reading Club packs up to go; scripts, coffee cups, black stockings, 
Husbands and wives pile into the waiting cars 

Just as we expect, life picks up and goes on 
But not art: crouched back there like a stalled stallion 
Stuffed in its gorgeous music box is the one gift 
That will not disappear but waits, but bides its time and waits 

For the next time we open it, that magical false structure 
Inside whose artifice is the lesson, buried alive, 
Of the grim machinations of the beautiful that always lead us 
To these eternally real lamentations, real sufferings, real cries.

title : Is My Team Ploughing

author : A. E. Housman

text : 
“Is my team ploughing, 
   That I was used to drive 
And hear the harness jingle 
   When I was man alive?” 

Ay, the horses trample, 
   The harness jingles now; 
No change though you lie under 
   The land you used to plough. 

“Is football playing 
   Along the river shore, 
With lads to chase the leather, 
   Now I stand up no more?” 

Ay the ball is flying, 
   The lads play heart and soul; 
The goal stands up, the keeper 
   Stands up to keep the goal. 

“Is my girl happy, 
   That I thought hard to leave, 
And has she tired of weeping 
   As she lies down at eve?” 

Ay, she lies down lightly, 
   She lies not down to weep: 
Your girl is well contented. 
   Be still, my lad, and sleep. 

“Is my friend hearty, 
   Now I am thin and pine, 
And has he found to sleep in 
   A better bed than mine?” 

Yes, lad, I lie easy, 
   I lie as lads would choose; 
I cheer a dead man’s sweetheart, 
   Never ask me whose.

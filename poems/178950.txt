title : The Mothering Blackness

author : Maya Angelou

text : 
She came home running 
       back to the mothering blackness   
       deep in the smothering blackness 
white tears icicle gold plains of her face   
       She came home running 

She came down creeping 
       here to the black arms waiting 
       now to the warm heart waiting 
rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face   
       She came down creeping 

She came home blameless 
       black yet as Hagar’s daughter 
       tall as was Sheba’s daughter 
threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face   
       She came home blameless

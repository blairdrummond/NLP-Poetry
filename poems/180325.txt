title : The Lost Land

author : Eavan Boland

text : 
I have two daughters. 

They are all I ever wanted from the earth. 

Or almost all. 

I also wanted one piece of ground: 

One city trapped by hills. One urban river. 
An island in its element. 

So I could say mine. My own. 
And mean it. 

Now they are grown up and far away 

and memory itself 
has become an emigrant, 
wandering in a place 
where love dissembles itself as landscape: 

Where the hills 
are the colours of a child's eyes, 
where my children are distances, horizons: 

At night, 
on the edge of sleep, 

I can see the shore of Dublin Bay. 
Its rocky sweep and its granite pier. 

Is this, I say 
how they must have seen it, 
backing out on the mailboat at twilight, 

shadows falling 
on everything they had to leave? 
And would love forever? 
And then 

I imagine myself 
at the landward rail of that boat 
searching for the last sight of a hand. 

I see myself 
on the underworld side of that water, 
the darkness coming in fast, saying 
all the names I know for a lost land: 

Ireland. Absence. Daughter.

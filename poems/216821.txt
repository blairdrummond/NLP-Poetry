title : Arrowhead

author : Robert Pack

text : 
    Where two streams joined, we met 
By accident, sitting upon an outcropping of rock 
With only the intent of watching 
Water flow beneath unwinding water. 
    Facing up-stream, she held a flower 
To the sun as I leaned back and found 
An arrowhead inside a crevice, which lay there 
As if someone had left it by intent 
As an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water 
Swirling upon stone and thus 
Transform the accident of meeting her—
Ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand—
Into stark fact as obdurate as rock. 
    Could I have called, "Look at this arrowhead 
I just found here!" Would she have thought 
"An accident, that's credible,"
Or feared that my intent was sinister, 
And that the implication of the arrowhead, 
Unlike the radiant white flower or 
The two streams merging into faster water, 
Casting up colored spume, 
Had been contrived by me, certain as rock 
That forms by geologic laws? 
    She had to know an arrowhead 
Is humanly designed with the intent to kill, 
Though now it's harmless as a flower 
Decorating someone's hair, 
Or water organized into a garden fountain. 
An arrowhead can now be used 
As an adornment for a necklace 
Like a flower in a painting where a stream 
Leaps past a light-reflecting rock 
With nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident. 
    And so our accidental meeting on the rock 
Flowed by, a flower cast upon the water 
With intent unknown, and all 
That's left now is the arrowhead.

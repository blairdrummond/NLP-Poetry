I know a little what it is like, once here at high tide   
Stranded, for them to be so attached to the bottom’s   
Sarcophagus lids, up to their brown green gold wine   
Bottle necks in the prevailing booze, riding, as far   
As we can see, like a picnic on a blanket. 

Whatever plucks them from below the red horizon 
Like snapped pulleys and ropes for the pyramidal effort 
Of the moon, they come in, they come through the breakers,   
Heaps of hair, writing across the beach a collapsed   
Script, signers of a huge independence. 

Melville thought them pure, bitter, seeing the fog-sized   
Flies dancing stiff and renaissance above. But I   
Have eaten nori and dulse, and to have gone deep   
Before being cast out leaves hardly a taste of loneliness.   
And I take in their iodine.

text : 
More than the beetles turned russet, 
sunset, dragging their shield, more than 
the crickets who think it’s evening all afternoon,   
it’s the bees I love this time of year. 

Sated, maybe drunk, who’ve lapped at the hips   
of too many flowers for one summer but   
still must go on hunting, one secret 
closing, another ensuing, picking 

lock after lock, rapping the glass, 
getting stuck in a puddle of dish soap,   
almost winter, almost dark, reading far past   
the last paragraph into the back blank page, 

acknowledgments, and history of type.   
I think when my head finally cracks 
out will come one of those ravening scouts   
autumnal with hunger beyond any sipping, 

swallowing, beyond the hive’s teeming   
factory’s needs. I think maybe then,   
when I’m dying like a bug in a puddle   
of dish soap, I’ll be relieved, 

my wings wet capes and not working,   
antennae slicked back and not working,   
eye that sees the ruby above going out, 
eye that sees the ruby within getting brighter 

as I drag myself to a tomato ripening   
on the window sill, reddest, softest   
island of my last planet, last aureola,   
stinger waving and useless. I’ll wait then, 

while air from the north rushes gulf air,   
a tree indicating wildly, each leaf woke   
in orange outcry. It won’t be suffering,   
exactly. Rain coming, then gone, a chill 

that means all my barbarous kind are alone   
and perishing, our unrecognizable young   
buried and waiting, bodies of fire becoming   
bodies of air. I don’t think there’s any way 

to prepare.

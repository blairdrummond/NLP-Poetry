title : Fried Beauty

Glory be to God for breaded things—   
   Catfish, steak finger, pork chop, chicken thigh,   
         Sliced green tomatoes, pots full to the brim   
With french fries, fritters, life-float onion rings,   
    Hushpuppies, okra golden to the eye,   
            That in all oils, corn or canola, swim   

Toward mastication’s maw (O molared mouth!);   
    Whatever browns, is dumped to drain and dry   
             On paper towels’ sleek translucent scrim,   
These greasy, battered bounties of the South:   
                            Eat them.

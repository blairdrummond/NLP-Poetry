When the wind clipped 
the whitecaps, and the flags 
came down before they shredded, 
we knew it was no norâ€™easter. 
The Blue Nose ferry stayed 
on course, west out of Yarmouth, 
while 100 miles of fog 
on the Bay blew away. 

The Captain let us stand 
on the starboard bridge 
and scan a jagged range. 
Shearwaters skimmed the peaks 
while storm petrels hunted valleys 
that slowly filled with gold. 
Alberto blew out in the Atlantic. 
We came back to earth 
that for days might tip and sway 
and cast us back to sea.

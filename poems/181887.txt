text : 
The Baltic Sea froze in 1307. Birds flew north 
From the Mediterranean in early January. 
There were meteor storms throughout Europe. 

On the first day of Lent 
Two children took their own lives: 
Their bodies 
Were sewn into goatskins 
And were dragged by the hangman’s horse 
The three miles down to the sea. 
They were given a simple grave in the sand. 

The following Sunday, Meister Eckhart 
Shouted that a secret word 
Had been spoken to him. He preached 

That Mary Magdalene 
Sought a dead man in the tomb 
But, in her confusion, found 
Only two angels laughing. . . 

This was a consequence of her purity 

And her all too human grief. 
The Baltic Sea 
Also froze in 1303— 
Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry.

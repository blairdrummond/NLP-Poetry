text : 
When you take the lost road 
You come to the snow 
And when you find the snow 
You get down on your hands and knees 
Like a sick dog 
That’s been eating the grasses of graveyards 
For twenty centuries. 

When you take the lost road 
You find woman 
Who has no fear of light 
Who can kill two cocks at once 
Light which has no fear of cocks 
And cocks who can’t call in the snow. 

You find lovers who’ve been listening 
For the same roosters to sing 
For twenty centuries 
Roosters that have swallowed stones 
Out of each other’s tracks 
But have never met 
Anywhere on the road. 

When you take the lost road 
You find the bright feathers of morning 
Laid out in proportion to snow and light 
And when the snow gets lost on the road 
Then the hot wind might blow from the south   
And there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries 
And everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again. 

When you get lost 
You come to the moon in the field 
The light all lovers soil 
The sheet no one leaves clean 
The light cocks are afraid to cross 
The same moon woman danced under 
For twenty centuries 
With blood on her face. 

When you get lost on the road 
You run into the dead 
Who have broken down stones 
In their throats for twenty centuries 
I saw two little crazy boys crying 
Because it was morning 
And when morning comes it comes 
In the morning and never at night. 

I saw two security police taking out a man’s balls 
And I saw two little crazy boys 
Crying by the road who wouldn’t go away 
But two has never been a number 
Because it’s only legal to pass one at a time 
It’s only a drum you can carry but you can’t beat 
It’s the evidence they need to make you disappear.

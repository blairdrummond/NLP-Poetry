Rhymed Stanza

Soft falls the shower, the thunders cease!
And see the messenger of peace
      Illumes the eastern skies;
Blest sign of firm unchanging love!
While others seek the cause to prove,
      That bids thy beauties rise.

My soul, content with humbler views,
Well pleased admires thy varied hues,
      And can with joy behold
Thy beauteous form, and wondering gaze
Enraptured on thy mingled rays
      Of purple, green, and gold.

Enough for me to deem divine
The hand that paints each glowing line;
      To think that thou art given
A transient gleam of that bright place
Where Beauty owns celestial grace,
      A faint display of Heaven!

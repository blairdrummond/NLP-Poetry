title : All Afternoon

author : Charles Tomlinson

text : 
All afternoon the shadows have been building 
A city of their own within the streets, 
Carefully correcting the perspectives 
With dark diagonals, and paring back 
Sidewalks into catwalks, strips of bright 
Companionways, as if it were a ship 
This counter-city. But the leaning, black 
Enjambements like ladders for assault 
Scale the façade and tie them to the earth, 
Confounding fire-escapes already meshed 
In slatted ambiguities. You touch
The sliding shapes to find which place is which 
And grime a finger with the ash of time
That blows through both, the shadow in the shade 
And in the light, that scours each thoroughfare 
To pit the walls, rise out of yard and stairwell 
And tarnish the Chrysler’s Aztec pinnacle.

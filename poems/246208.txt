title : Swim, Girl, Swim

for Gertrude Ederle
As Europe woke from sleep,
Young Trudy Ederle
At Cap Gris Nez in France
Dived into a daunting sea.

Many had tried to make
This superhuman swimâ€”
Thirty-five punishing miles.
Chances, at best, were slim.

When Fury found the waves,
Far from the western shore,
Her trainer shouted, "Let's turn back!"
But Trudy cried, "What for?"

Under an English moon,
The celebration began
After the fastest crossing
By woman or by man.

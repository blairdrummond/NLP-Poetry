title : This Room

author : John Ashbery

text : 
The room I entered was a dream of this room. 
Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine. 
The oval portrait 
of a dog was me at an early age. 
Something shimmers, something is hushed up. 

We had macaroni for lunch every day 
except Sunday, when a small quail was induced 
to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things? 
You are not even here.

title : The Jew and the Rooster Are One

author : Gerald Stern

text : 
After fighting with his dead brothers and his dead sisters 
he chose to paint the dead rooster of his youth, 
thinking God wouldn’t mind a rooster, would he?—or thinking 
a rooster would look good in a green armchair 
with flecks of blood on his breast and thighs, his wings 
resting a little, their delicate bones exposed, a 
few of the plumes in blue against the yellow 
naked body, all of those feathers plucked 
as if by a learned butcher, and yet the head 
hanging down, the comb disgraced, the mouth 
open as if for screaming, the right front chair leg, 
seen from a certain angle, either a weapon 
or a strong right arm, a screaming arm, the arm 
of an agitator; and yet at the same time the chair 
as debonair as any, the brown mahogany 
polished, the carving nineteenth century, the velvet 
green, an old velour, as if to match 
the plumes a little, a blue with a green. No rabbi 
was present, this he knew, and no dead butcher 
had ever been there with his burnished knife 
and his bucket of sand; this was the angry rooster 
that strutted from one small house to another, that scratched 
among the rhubarb, he is the one who stopped 
as if he were thinking, he is upside down now 
and plucked. It looks as if his eye can hardly 
contain that much of sorrow, as if it wanted 
to disappear, and it looks as if his legs 
were almost helpless, and though his body was huge 
compared to the armchair, it was only more 
horrible that way, and though his wings were lifted 
it wasn’t for soaring, it was more for bedragglement 
and degradation. Whatever else there was 
of memory there had to be revenge in there, 
even revenge on himself, for he had to be 
the rooster, though that was easy, he was the armchair 
too, and he was the butcher, it was a way 
to understand, there couldn’t be another, he had to 
paint like that, he has to scrape the skin 
and put the blotches on, and though it was 
grotesque to put a dead rooster in an armchair 
his table could have been full, or he just liked 
the arrangement, or he was good at painting a chair 
and it was done first—although I doubt it—or someone 
brought him the bird—a kind of gift—for food was 
cheap then, and roosters were easy to cook; but it was 
more than anything else a kind of Tartar, 
a kind of Jew, he was painting, something 
that moved from Asia to Europe, something furious, 
ill and dreamy, something that stood in the mud 
beside a large wooden building and stared at a cloud, 
it was so deep in thought, and it had tears 
in a way, there was no getting around that kind 
of thinking even if he stood in the middle of the room 
holding his paintbrush like a thumb at arm’s length 
closing one of his eyes he still was standing 
in the mud shrieking, he still was dying for corn, 
he still was golden underneath his feathers 
with freckles of blood, for he was a ripped-open Jew, 
and organs all on show, the gizzard, the liver, 
for he was a bleeding Tartar, and he was a Frenchman 
dying on the way to Paris and he was 
tethered to a table, he was slaughtered.

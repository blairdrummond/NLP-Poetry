text : 
What a fuckup you are.    
What dumbshit you do.    
Your father's voice    
still whispers in you,    
    
despite the joys    
that sweeten each day.    
Your Genius it isn't    
until, dying away,    
    
it worms back through    
the sparkling dream    
where you drown him    
in an inch-deep stream:    
    
your knee in his back,    
your strength on his skull,    
it begins singing    
praise for your skill.

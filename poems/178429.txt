title : The Paris Mouse

author : Sandra M. Gilbert

text : 
hunched over the greasy 
burner on the stove 
was noir, as in 

film noir, as in 
cauchemar, 
as in le nuit 

not blanche but 
noir, the dream you can’t 
wake up from, meaning she 

was a mouse fatale, 
licking the old oil 
glued to the old 

cooktop, feasting 
in her tiny hunched-up 
sewer life 

on fats & proteins for her 
bébés all atremble in their 
rotting poubel nest, 

so when I screamed my piercing 
Anglo-Imperial scream of 
horror & betrayal— 

not my stove, not my traces of 
pot au feu— 
she leaped, balletic, over 

the sink, the fridge, the lave-vaiselle, 
& back to the cave & the trash she 
scuttled, grim as a witch 

in La Fontaine 
who has to learn 
the lesson we 

all must learn: 
Reality is always sterner  
than pleasures of the nighttime burner.

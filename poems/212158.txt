title : Chinese New Year

author : Lynda Hull

text : 
The dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows 
   pasted with colored squares, past the man 
who leans into the phone booth’s red pagoda, past 
   crates of doves and roosters veiled 

until dawn. Fireworks complicate the streets 
   with sulphur as people exchange gold 
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts 
   who linger, needy even in death. I am 

almost invisible. Hands could pass through me 
   effortlessly. This is how it is 
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows 
   untranslatable as the shop signs, 

the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle 
   in the stairwell, the corridor where 
the doors are blue months ajar. Hands 
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon 

of a face. For hours the soft numeric 
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts 
down the hallway where languid Mai trails 
   her musk of sex and narcotics. 

There is no grief in this, only the old year 
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing 
in my hand beneath the lightbulb’s electric jewel. 
   Between voices and fireworks 

wind works bricks to dust—hush, hush— 
   no language I want to learn. I can touch 
the sill worn by hands I’ll never know 
   in this room with its low table 

where I brew chrysanthemum tea. The sign 
   for Jade Palace sheds green corollas 
on the floor. It’s dangerous to stand here 
   in the chastening glow, darkening 

my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest 
   of my life widening away from me, waiting 
for the man I married to pass beneath 
   the sign of the building, to climb 

the five flights and say his Chinese name for me. 
   He’ll rise up out of the puzzling streets 
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where 
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle 

the whole district is waiting for, like 
   some benevolent arrest—the moment 
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve 
   each bad bet, every sly mischance, 

the dalliance of hands. They turn in lamplight 
   the way I turn now. Wai Min is in the doorway. 
He brings fish. He brings lotus root. 
   He brings me ghost money.

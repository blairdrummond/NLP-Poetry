title : What Is the Field?

author : Leila Wilson

text : 
The field is filled   
with what we see 
without sleep. 
Never completely   
closed, it quickly erodes   
when tilled before rain.   

If clogged with boulders 
it won’t be razed 
and once burdened 
cannot quicken 
under flocks. 

The field reveals 
glint and holds 
leaning, pulls 
twist from taut 
knots of buds. 

We watch the field   
for stirring, wait   
for stems to spring   
back from sparrows. 

We hope for a swell   
in its middle so   
we can say we saw   
the sway that comes 
from noticing.   

Water meanders 
to prairie potholes,   
throws cordgrass 
into switchbacks 
as we push past   
bramble and scare   
a whistling wheel 
of geese into air. 

The field draws 
hawks and sides 
of trains, cradles 
pools from storms 
where ducks plumb 
for water snails.   

We trample light   
between us, 
no way to lope 
in parting the swales. 
We must flatten   
to fill the space 
with all the rolling 
wrapped up in us.   

Before home,   
the gabled barn   
across the road 
throws the brightest 
rise we’ve ever seen 
the field try on.   

The field is not 
in rows, is not   
a faded saw-songed 
croon. It pushes green 
a mist above mud, 
shows how we make do. 

We wonder 
what we’re not   
in the field. 
What scours, cuts, 
or knocks. 
If we could stay 
and still feel full 
the low line rounding   
out a spread 
of subtle slope.

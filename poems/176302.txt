title : The Worm

author : Ralph Bergengren

text : 
When the earth is turned in spring 
The worms are fat as anything. 

And birds come flying all around 
To eat the worms right off the ground. 

They like the worms just as much as I 
Like bread and milk and apple pie. 

And once, when I was very young, 
I put a worm right on my tongue. 

I didn't like the taste a bit, 
And so I didn't swallow it. 

But oh, it makes my Mother squirm 
Because she thinks I ate that worm!

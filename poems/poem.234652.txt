A Shropshire Lad 53: The lad came to the door at night

Love, Heartache & Loss



The lad came to the door at night, 
    When lovers crown their vows, 
And whistled soft and out of sight 
    In shadow of the boughs. 

'I shall not vex you with my face 
    Henceforth, my love, for aye; 
So take me in your arms a space 
    Before the east is grey. 

'When I from hence away am past 
    I shall not find a bride, 
And you shall be the first and last 
    I ever lay beside.' 

She heard and went and knew not why; 
    Her heart to his she laid; 
Light was the air beneath the sky 
    But dark under the shade. 

'Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast 
    Seems not to rise and fall, 
And here upon my bosom prest 
    There beats no heart at all?' 

'Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock, 
    You should have felt it then; 
But since for you I stopped the clock 
    It never goes again.' 

'Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips 
    Wet from your neck on mine? 
What is it falling on my lips, 
    My lad, that tastes of brine?' 

'Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear, 
    For when the knife has slit 
The throat across from ear to ear 
    'Twill bleed because of it.'

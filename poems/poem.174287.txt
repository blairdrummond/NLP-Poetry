Sonnet

This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect
         God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she
         Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee.
Unto God's will she brought devout respect,
Profound simplicity of intellect,
         And supreme patience. From her mother's knee
         Faithful and hopeful; wise in charity;
Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect.

So held she through her girlhood; as it were
         An angel-water'd lily, that near God
                Grows and is quiet. Till, one dawn at home,
She woke in her white bed, and had no fear
         At all,?yet wept till sunshine, and felt aw'd:
                Because the fulness of the time was come.

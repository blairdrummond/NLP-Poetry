title : My Father’s False Teeth

author : Richard Garcia

text : 
I take my dinners alone,
 in my room, but I can still
 hear them through the door,
 my father’s false teeth
 clicking like a wooden gate
 with a metal latch, swinging
 open, swinging closed.
 In a water glass at night
 they float like an exhibit
 in formaldehyde
 of a stillborn child.
 The nightlight shining
 through the glass—
a spelunker’s flashlight
 in an underwater cave
 illuminating the fossilized
 toothed beak of a fierce bird
 now extinct. My father’s 
 false teeth, when he tries
 to spit in the toilet, fall in.
 Only my hand is small enough 
 to reach underwater
 into the hole and pull them
 out from the pipe
 where they are wedged
 sideways, slightly open.
 Sometimes a woman expels
 from her womb something
 that is all hair and teeth.
 George Washington
 was said to always dine alone.
 His teeth were made of wood, 
 whalebone, and mastodon ivory.
 My father’s false teeth, God’s
 first clumsy attempt at wings:
 two imprints of a horse’s hooves
 in red clay, hinged together,
 ringed with small square bones,
 too heavy to ever fly.
 My father’s false teeth
 in the click of computer keys
 in the tick tick of the eucalyptus
 outside the window
 as it twists out of its skin
 that falls on the pavement
 like sheets of parchment.
 A faraway splash in the middle
 of the night, I sit up in bed, startled—
 it was George Washington throwing
 something across the Delaware,
 not a coin, but his teeth.

There is no noisier place than the suburbs, 
someone once said to me 
as we were walking along a fairway, 
and every day is delighted to offer fresh evidence: 

the chainsaw, the leaf-blower blowing 
one leaf around an enormous house with columns, 
on Mondays and Thursdays the garbage truck 
equipped with air brakes, reverse beeper, and merciless grinder. 

There’s dogs, hammers, backhoes 
or serious earthmovers if today is not your day. 
How can the birds get a peep 
or a chirp in edgewise, I would like to know? 

But this morning is different, 
only a soft clicking sound 
and the low talk of two workmen working 
on the house next door, laying tile I am guessing. 

Otherwise, all quiet for a change, 
just the clicking of tiles being handled 
and their talking back and forth in Spanish 
then one of them asking in English 

“What was her name?” and the silence of the other.

As if by saying “morning” on January 8th 
the light would be set forward 
along the megalophonous shore 

Was there anything else you wanted to know 
about the body where I belong 
how the torso is cut off from a waving arm 

by the yellow space in the background 
and how the head has been put on wrong 
or not wrong. Each looked into the water 

and was frightened by a different thing 
of his or her own making 
One was frightened by stripes 

and the other by a turtle 
even though I knew it wouldn’t bite 
but would take me for a ride 

It was the time when the phone always rings 
to dissolve the mediating scene 
in which a phone always rings 

to help us with our counting 
I say hello to the lateral darkness 
who answers guardedly 

in painted fragments. The drop of a hat 
If the shoe fits. A thin bird flaps 
before it sits. Who answers noiselessly 

Hans Memling is watching from my matchbox 
where the serpent lives 
This is his nest

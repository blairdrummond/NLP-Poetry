title : Love Recidivus

author : Lisa Barnett

text : 
Whatever it may be, we may suppose 
it is not love, for love must leave its trace 
like contraband seized and displayed in rows; 
is not sufficient reason to erase 

the careful lives we have so far lived throughâ€” 
there is no call for us to undermine 
the walls we've built; no need to think anew 
of all the chains and choices that define 

us still. And yet for all our fine intent 
a single touch ignites the night and tries 
resolve past all resisting. What we meant 
before we mean again; fidelities 

have yet been known to shift and come undone 
and all good reasons fail us, one by one.

title : Ultima Thule

A little candlewax on the thumbnail, liquid   
at first, slipping, then stalled to an ice-hood.   
Another layer, another, and the child lies back,   
his thumb a hummock, his small knuckle   
buckled with cracks. 

No snow yet, but 
the last white meadows of switchwort and saxifrage 
mimic it. Already the bears brush back 
through the dwarf willows—Hubbart Point, Cape Henrietta Maria, 
the bay's deep arc flattening, lessening 
as land extends through the fast-ice and the seam 
of open leads stretches, withdraws. 

They have come for the pack floes, for the slow 
rafting. And repeat on their white faces, the boy thinks,   
the low strokes of the borealis: violet mouths,   
madder blue at the eyelids. Perhaps he will walk   
to the shoreline—no shore, of course, just miles   
of land-fast ice stretched over water, stretched out   
to water, the line where each begins 

a filament, a vapor. By then the bears will be 
sailors, or, far to the north, stalled in their waxy sleep.   
He yawns, looks down at his slipper, his floormat   
of braided fleece. By then the lights 
will be thicker, greens and magentas flashing, rolling in 

at times like fog. To go where nothing lives. 
He turns, settles. To extend a little breath 
out over that ice—the white, cumbersome bodies   
migrating in reverse with the others, dragging   
between them a lifeline, plump and intricate, 

like a net, like purse seiners dragging a cork net,   
its great arc spiraling, tighter, tighter, 
now green in those lights, now blue, now   
pink as the boy's ear, 
where all night a line of cold 
traces the rim, the lobe, 
circles down, chills, and recedes.

You can never tell 
By the looks of a frog 
How high it can leap, 
Said her Auntie Ott. 
Haley's hair flips up and down 
As she moves in her hard shoes, 
Her leather coat for winter 
Is lengthy and sways, some stains 
Mottling the bottom— 

Elegant windows in decline 
That at one time 
One could climb through, 
French imitation 
Nailed shut for decades. In shadow 
Pigeons peck in dirty snow 
Massed against the closest wall. 
What her hair will look like someday, 
She surmises. But otherwise 
Isn't troubled by the future. 
Don't walk like a duck, 
Men don't like it, said Auntie Ott. 
Not necessarily, responded her grandmother, 
As she brushed a crumb onto a saucer— 
Playing cards, stories of earlier poverty. 
As a girl she pretended 
To be as worried as they 
Whether Bobby would be drafted 
And killed in the war. 
Maybe she's important in art 
Or decoration, supposes the student 
Adjusting his pack— 
As the light changes, he steps out 
But she banks around the corner 
Behind him, purseless, gloveless, 
Passing a restaurant, a coin store, 
A key shop—owners staring over the street 
Wishing they were younger. 
Or lived in an earlier time. 
Which is partly the fault 
Of late winter. Clittering ice 
In trees of Veteran's Park. . . 
Lightly swinging her arms now, 
Heading uphill, growing distant, 
Like a figure studied 
In Auntie Ott's Utrillo print— 
Stick-like, scarecrow-like— 
To her right, a converted house 
Looking vaguely like a shrunken 
Monticello. . . Cream-colored barriers 
Of plowed snow as sun sprays 
More volume. . . A moment of deception 

There's not much that can be done, 
Said the city, when the oaks 
Were removed for curb repair. 
The dome fell off the theatre. 
A policeman peering east, frozen. 
Just as the museum is shuttered 
Next to the blank bowling alley 
(which is our other perspective). 
Haley has never felt trapped, 
Though the possibilities, occasionally, 
Have skirted about like sparrows. 
A jet crosses the sky. 
Followed by its vibration. 
What she found sustaining 
She learned in college. 
Where she goes is no one's business 
Either. 
Neither is she worshipped 
And adored—Auntie Ott 
Would be dismayed. 
Though not entirely

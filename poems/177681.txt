title : A Poem about Baseballs

author : Denis Johnson

text : 
for years the scenes bustled   
through him as he dreamed he was   
alive. then he felt real, and slammed 

awake in the wet sheets screaming   
too fast, everything moves 
too fast, and the edges of things   
are gone. four blocks away 

a baseball was a dot against   
the sky, and he thought, my   
glove is too big, i will 

drop the ball and it will be   
a home run. the snow falls   
too fast from the clouds,   
and night is dropped and 

snatched back like a huge 
joke. is that the ball, or is 
it just a bird, and the ball is 
somewhere else, and i will 
miss it? and the edges are gone, my 

hands melt into the walls, my   
hands do not end where the wall   
begins. should i move 
forward, or back, or will the ball 

come right to me? i know i will   
miss, because i always miss when it 
takes so long. the wall has no   
surface, no edge, the wall 

fades into the air and the air is   
my hand, and i am the wall. my   
arm is the syringe and thus i 

become the nurse, i am you,   
nurse. if he gets 
around the bases before the   
ball comes down, is it a home 

run, even if i catch it? if we could   
slow down, and stop, we 
would be one fused mass careening   
at too great a speed through 
the emptiness. if i catch 

the ball, our side will 
be up, and i will have to bat,   
and i might strike out.

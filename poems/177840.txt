title : A Poem on the Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy

author : Nikki Giovanni

text : 
Trees are never felled . . . in summer . . . Not when the fruit . . .   
is yet to be borne . . . Never before the promise . . . is fulfilled . . .   
Not when their cooling shade . . . has yet to comfort . . . 

Yet there are those . . . unheeding of nature . . . indifferent to   
ecology . . . ignorant of need . . . who . . . with ax and sharpened   
saw . . . would . . . in boots . . . step forth damaging . . . 

Not the tree . . . for it falls . . . But those who would . . . in 
summer’s heat . . . or winter’s cold . . . contemplate . . . the   
beauty . . .

Under this Luxemburg of heaven,   
upright capstan, 
                         small eagles. . . . 
is the port of N.Y. . . . .          

gilders, stampers, pen makers, goldbeaters, 

apprehensions of thunder   
                      speed 
                           the whore   
                      indifference   
                           son 
                      glioma 

Tammany, McCoy, 
the bonze doors of the Guarantee Trust,   
the copper spandrels. 

Orangerie and game room 
with Old English tall twisted   
stem engraved goblets 
and Royal Copenhagen porcelain. 

A mutton fat jade 
Chien Lung 
                bowl 
a toilet bottle 
                        amethyst 
stopper & monogram shield. 

A technical display. 
You bought a perfume bottle 
and a Chinese shawl. 
Susannah set a headstone in St. Paul. 

I’m inside waiting for a surprise 
I’m in love with the girl on the Wabash   
I’m alone with a hand in my hand   
and a pair of wonderful eyes 

but I’m blue 
I have to speak   
I want to do   
I want to see 
the sights obscure me 
the facts secure me 

The Maine sails out to sea 
the undertaker drives to Hartford 

Yesterday the ducks flew in a mackerel sky.   
I had the allotropes of vision, 
something historical at the controls 
of North America, 
heavyweight and metaphorical. 

What are the facts? 
they swept the city hall today 
they set the lathe dogs   
trimmed the tool posts   
scraped the bearings   
shellacked the knots,   
they set the capital   
upon the shaft. 

Somebody has to drive the spikes   
pitch the gears 
oil the cams 
somebody has to kill the whisky   
somebody has to speak 

What are the facts?

Inland is 
the goat in open field.   
The milk is marketed.   
Attend our table. 

The sand 
             and fluorspar 
and the soda ash 
make a blue 
                  aventurine glass   
for this city, 
                      a lion rampant 
on his hind feet, royally   
clawing, tail whipped up.

come, great city, 
give us that old-time vaudeville 

”During the water-movement 
of the French horns 
and the lovelace of a violin 
a wire from my girl, 
`I love you but I need a deposit.‘ 
Even the ventriloquist’s dummy laughed   
after we combed his pretty red hair   
and set him on his tricycle.“ 

Do you know the story of Sal?   
She was a lonely little gal 
with the lovelight in her eyes 
and Mr. H. H. at the ivories 
and she was happy (honest to God) 

In the season of Romain effects   
and synthetic American lights 
she drove into a California suburb   
in a high-compression gull-line Suiza   
rolling her Klieg eyes 
like revolving doors 

whereupon the jackass   
full of animal gas 
floated blissfully 
into the dance 
of the seven veils, 
yakking, ‘I have that   
funny feeling again,   
it must be love.’ 

Commentary: nothing 
so marks the copulative man 
as a corkscrew and a bottle opener. 

Question: 
Could you stand an old man   
to a cup of coffee? 
It’s hard walking 
with this silver plate 
in my head. 

Come, great city, 
                           you have full powers   
of attorney to protect your friends.

Immigrants from Warsaw 
move into a furnished room   
close to the stores 
under St. Chrysostom’s carillon   
with a porcelain pitcher 
and bath and hand towels 
on the bed rails. 
A new sign appears 
in the ground-floor window: 
Smocking, Hemstitching, Rhinestone Setting 

Our hour from here 
                            a loggia 
above the pepper trees   
a tiny cascade and vines   
above the bath house   
men and women driving   
on the fairway, laughing 

surrounded by Galloway   
pottery, garden furniture   
and white daisies.

When the light sprang from the sea, blowing,   
the window sintered and blew like Venus   
revealing my tenderness 
                                    and many minds   
the way a night shot 
discovers a beast drinking 
and my responsibilities 
                                    eating me 
as dogs eat gizzard. 

I saw the city 
                      changed 
set up like laboratory glassware,   
amines of herring brine, 
the malic acid of the sea buckthorn,   
glass-enclosed prescription balance,   
steel and agate, Fabrik Koln 
a physics clear as alcohol, 
La Vita Nuova, I hardly knew. 

Creditors dined at the Cliquot Club,   
they read the papers, trade changed.   
Their horses died, the big-bellied;   
their dogs slept in the steam heat. 

An ambulance with modest   
glass doors and a silver cross   
keeps night watch: 

                            A surgeon.   
Delicate nickel-plated 
instruments are laid on trays. 

Illuminated on the operating table 
                            naked glassblowers,   
gunsmiths, barbers, clerks, importers,   
old men from hotels, pink and tailored,   
naphtha-smelling Irish priests,   
cravat-and-boy face of the movie usher,   
Frankel, Shmulik, Old Country watchmakers 

then a white horse in the park, 
cigars and politics. 
The city wrapped in cellophane, 
an act-born eggshape 
                               twisted like Ugolino 

one sea-water, 
                      one circulatory system   
of man observing his magnificent urea.

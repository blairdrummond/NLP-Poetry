title : And like a Dying Lady, Lean and Pale

author : Percy Bysshe Shelley

text : 
And like a dying lady, lean and pale,
Who totters forth, wrapp'd in a gauzy veil,
Out of her chamber, led by the insane
And feeble wanderings of her fading brain,
The moon arose up in the murky East,
A white and shapeless massÂ—

title : At the Altar

author : Eleanor Ross Taylor

text : 
That bag you packed me
 when you sent me
 to the universe—
 camp after camp I’ve opened it
 debating whether to unpack—
         Not yet, not yet—
 Why did I feel so much in it
 was dangerous on the playground,
 too good for everyday,
 feel those splendid fireworks
 hazardous to institutions,
 unmannerly to etiquette,
 so that, time after time,
 I found myself saying
        Not yet?
  
 At each new place I faced it,
 it suggested,
 Here spread out your things,
 put on this coat,
 open this bottle—
        No, not yet . . .
 sometimes throwing something out,
 giving things away,
 lightening my load. . . .
  
 The more I pull out,
 the more it seems, some days,
 is left inside,
 the heavier it is.
  
 Sometimes I think this package
 is almost a door
 the opening of which
 careening across heaven
 could be fatal.
  
 Some days now I wonder if I’ll ever
 dare face my given garments—
 permanently wrinkled,
 surely out of date—
 your travel-thought
 wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt—
 till I’ve absorbed it,
 like those stitches that dissolve
 in an incision
 where something’s been removed.

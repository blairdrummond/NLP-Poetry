title : Old Woman With Protea Flowers, Kahalui Airport

author : Kathleen Flenniken

text : 
She wears the run-down slippers of a local   
and in her arms, five rare protea   
wrapped in newsprint, big as digger pine cones.   
Our hands can’t help it and she lets us touch.   
Her brother grows them for her, upcountry.   
She’s spending the day on Oahu   
with her flowers and her dogs.   Protea   
for four dogs’ graves, two for her favorite.   
She’ll sit with him into the afternoon   
and watch the ocean from Koolau.   
An old woman’s paradise, she tells us,   
and pets the flowers’ soft, pink ears.

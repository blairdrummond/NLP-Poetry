title : Alla Breve Loving

author : C. D. Wright

text : 
Three people drinking out of the bottle 
in the living room.
A cold rain. Quiet as a mirror.

One of the men
stuffs his handkerchief in his coat, 
climbs the stairs with the girl. 
The other man is left sitting

at the desk with the wine and the headache, 
turning an old Ellington side 
over in his mind. And over.

He held her like a saxophone 
when she was his girl.
Her tongue trembling at the reed.

The man lying next to her now 
thinks of another woman. 
Her white breath idling

before he drove off.
He said something about a spell, 
watching the snow fall on her shoulders.

The musician
crawls back into his horn, 
ancient terrapin
at the approach of the wheel.

A Colonial Custom
Bathsheba came out to the sun, 
Out to our walled cherry-trees; 
The tears adown her cheek did run, 
Bathsheba standing in the sun, 
Telling the bees. 

My mother had that moment died; 
Unknowing, sped I to the trees, 
And plucked Bathsheba's hand aside; 
Then caught the name that there she cried 
Telling the bees. 

Her look I never can forget, 
I that held sobbing to her knees; 
The cherry-boughs above us met; 
I think I see Bathsheba yet 
Telling the bees.

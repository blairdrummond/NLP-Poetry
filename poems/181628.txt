title : Night

author : Michael Hofmann

text : 
It's all right   
Unless you're either lonely or under attack.   
That strange effortful 
Repositioning of yourself. Laundry, shopping,   
Hours, the telephone—unless misinformed— 
Only ever ringing for you, if it ever does.   
The night—yours to decide, 
Among drink, or books, or lying there. 
On your back, or curled up. 

An embarrassment of poverty.

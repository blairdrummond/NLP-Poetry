title : A Poet’s Poem

author : Brenda Shaughnessy

text : 
If it takes me all day, 
I will get the word freshened out of this poem. 

I put it in the first line, then moved it to the second, 
and now it won’t come out. 

It’s stuck. I’m so frustrated, 
so I went out to my little porch all covered in snow 

and watched the icicles drip, as I smoked 
a cigarette.

Finally I reached up and broke a big, clear spike 
off the roof with my bare hand. 

And used it to write a word in the snow. 
I wrote the word snow. 

I can’t stand myself.

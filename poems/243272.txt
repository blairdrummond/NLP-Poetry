title : Seeding an Alphabet

author : Emily Warn

text : 
To invent the alef-beit,
 decipher the grammar of crows,
 read a tangle of bare branches
 with vowels of the last leaves
 scrawling their jittery speech
 on the sky’s pale page.
  
 Choose a beginning.
 See what God yields and dirt cedes
 when tines disturb fescue, vetch, and sage,
 when your hand dips grain from a sack,
 scattering it among engraved furrows.
  
 Beyond the hill, a plume of dust
 where oxen track the hours.
 Does God lead or follow or scout?
 To answer, count to one again and again:
 a red maple leaf and a yellow maple leaf
 that wind rifles and rain shines until they let go,
 blazing their scripted nothingness on air.

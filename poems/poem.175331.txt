Ballad

There was once a little animal,
      No bigger than a fox,
And on five toes he scampered
      Over Tertiary rocks.
They called him Eohippus,
      And they called him very small,
And they thought him of no value --
      When they thought of him at all;
For the lumpish old Dinoceras
      And Coryphodon so slow
Were the heavy aristocracy
      In days of long ago.

Said the little Eohippus,
      "I am going to be a horse!
And on my middle finger-nails
      To run my earthly course!
I'm going to have a flowing tail!
      I'm going to have a mane!
I'm going to stand fourteen hands high
      On the psychozoic plain!"

The Coryphodon was horrified,
      The Dinoceras was shocked;
And they chased young Eohippus,
      But he skipped away and mocked.
Then they laughed enormous laughter,
      And they groaned enormous groans.
And they bade young Eohippus
      Go view his father's bones.
Said they, "You always were as small
      And mean as now we see,
And that's conclusive evidence
      That you're always going to be.
What! Be a great, tall, handsome beast,
      With hoofs to gallop on?
Why! You'd have to change your nature! 
      Said the Loxolophodon.
They considered him disposed of,
      And retired with gait serene;
That was the way they argued
      In "the early Eocene".
There was once an Anthropoidal Ape,
      Far smarter than the rest,
And everything that they could do
      He always did the best;
So they naturally disliked him
      And they gave him shoulders cool,
And when they had to mention him
      They said he was a fool.

Cried this pretentious Ape one day,
      "I'm going to be a man!
And stand upright, and hunt, and fight,
      And conquer all I can!
I'm going to cut down forest trees,
      To make my houses higher!
I'm going to kill the Mastodon!
      I'm going to make a fire!"

Loud screamed the Anthropoidal Apes
      With laughter wild and gay;
They tried to catch that boastful one,
      But he always got away.
So they yelled at him in chorus,
      Which he minded not a whit;
And they pelted him with cocoanuts,
      Which didn't seem to hit.
And then they gave him reasons
      Which they thought of much avail,
To prove how his preposterous
      Attempt was sure to fail.
Said the sages, "In the first place,
      The thing cannot be done!
And, second, if it could be,
      It would not be any fun!
And, third, and most conclusive,
      And admitting no reply,
You would have to change your nature!

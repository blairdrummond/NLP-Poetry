Love Is A Sickness Full of Woes

Love, Desire, Infatuation & Crushes



Love is a sickness full of woes,
   All remedies refusing;
A plant that with most cutting grows,
   Most barren with best using.
      Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighting cries,
      Heigh ho!

Love is a torment of the mind,
   A tempest everlasting;
And Jove hath made it of a kind
   Not well, not full, nor fasting.
      Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighing cries,
      Heigh ho!

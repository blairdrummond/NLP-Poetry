title : Between Hallowe'en and Bonfire Night

author : Roddy Lumsden

text : 
Just then, encountering my ruddy face    
in the grand piano's cold black craquelure,    
it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon    
dipping up over the roofs of the Tenderloin.    
    
Only when I have done with the myths—    
the inner spill that triggers us to flame,    
breasts so sensitive a moment's touch             
will call down fever; the dark sea-lane    
    
between limbic squall and the heart's harbour—    
will I picture you, just beyond innocence,    
lying stripped by a thrown-wide window,    
letting the cool breeze covet your ardour.

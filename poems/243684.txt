title : Blues for Alice

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
When you get in on a try you never learn it back
 umpteen times the tenth part of a featured world
 in black and in back it’s roses and fostered nail
 bite rhyme sling slang, a song that teaches without
 travail of the tale, the one you longing live
 and singing burn
  
 It’s insane to remain a trope, of a rinsing out
 or a ringing whatever, it’s those bells that . . .
 and other riskier small day and fain would be
 of the soap a sky dares
  
                                                but we remand,
 that we a clasp of the silence you and I, all of
 tiny sphering rates back, I say to told wall, back
 and back and leave my edge, and add an L
  
 Night is so enclosed we’ll never turn its page
 its eye, can be mine will be yours, to see all the people
 the underneath livid reaching part and past of the lying buildings
 the overreacher stops and starts, at in his head, in
 in her rhythm
 that knowledge is past all of us, so we flare and tap
 and top it right up, constant engage and flap in on
 keeping pace, our whelming rift, and soil and gleam
 and give back the voice, like those eary dead
  
 Step down off our whelm lessons and shortly fired
 enter the bristle strum of Corrosion Kingdom
 where the last comes by first ever ring, every
 race through that tunnel of sun drop and pencil
 in the margins of a flare, of higher wish than dare,
 the stroked calmings of a line will spin and chime
 in blue quicks of a dream blues, the chores
 of those whispering gone crenulations
  
 To meet a care is to dial redeem
 and we limp in the time sound balms
 so out of kilter is my name in the sun, and I win
 in the moon and you sing in that other spelling of win
 the way a blue is never singular

title : Marco Polo at Finisterre

author : Matthew Brenneman

text : 
For R. L. B.
For all the far-flung continents he'd crossed, 
Revealing lands they found beyond belief; 
For all the roads that lay behind him, lost 
In caverns of some atavistic grief 

He'd carried with him since he was a boy; 
For all the years, he should be weary now. 
How then could he explain this welling joy, 
A old man on a wintry beach? Or how 

It seemed the wind bore perfumes of a whole 
New wilderness, a lush and green Brazil 
Over the dim horizon of his soul, 
Farther than memory, beyond his will, 

Where even now, in vibrant canopies, 
The twilight songs of bird to hidden bird 
Rose up in wild, untutored harmonies 
More lovely for their never being heard.

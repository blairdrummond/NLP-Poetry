What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's crying with all her might and main,
 And she won't eat her dinner--rice pudding again--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 I've promised her dolls and a daisy-chain,
 And a book about animals--all in vain--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain;
 But, look at her, now she's beginning again!
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
   
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 I've promised her sweets and a ride in the train,
 And I've begged her to stop for a bit and explain--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain,
 And it's lovely rice pudding for dinner again!--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?

﻿﻿Help me come up with a strategy to get through this white noise. — U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney,   November 2001
Are we on the ground now? Ally cells and I said operations. 
 We cleared 50% of a wonderful friend and enduring opposition. 
 Take the solid. 
 Louder. 
 We clearly are loud. We are the postal system. 
 No evidence has been information. 
 Attacking the caves. Are you on the ground enduring? 
 A wonderful friend ramped it up. 
 You ought to open your mail. 
 Opposition element: the air. The talents work with precision. 
 84%. The population attacking the caves, the talents work with the
 caves and tunnels. 
 Hiding in caves, wavering in caves and hiding in mosques. 
 A wonderful friend on the ground. 
 Freedom I said: the enduring ally cells. 
 Interested in the view, in our aid sensitivities. 
 50% to the front of our effort adding that 80% are willing to play. 
 Independent oper-oppo-sition forces that are rosy. 
 So make assumptions on the ground. Are we on the ground now? 
 Can be more than air. The target. The air liaison.
 Campaign with the bombing and entirely happy. 
 Attacking the leaflets. 
 We keep working hiding in hiding in caves
 and cowering in cowering in cowering in caves
 and I could say confidential areas. 
 The mosques and rest efforts are mad. 
 Execution in the targeting of democracy. 
 Those risks culti-targeting to minimize the individual. 
 An obligation to the spirit of enterprise. 
 A war of roundup freezing worldwide, and proceeding on course. 
 Training facilities, proceeding on course, freezing their guided
 munitions. 
 A population is tons of struggle against evil. 
 A civilized world of innocents in the mud, an enemy that’s on the 
 ground for there is no neutral ever. No neutral homeland. 
 For the first time first time first time in history
 ordinary busi-security bioterror
 to defend enemies with the no-ness of life. 
 Confident in destruction / complete and cause / certain of the rightness
 of this time / in the right / man the victories / to comment for a freer
 world history / committee of evil / defeat the forces / we will fight and 
 great coalition wherever they are an era of over flight right against
 terror basing global terror the global trade and lives of our world improve / 
 the modern alliance / I like citizens / but rather than the dust settle it
 could mean / as acknowledged / the carpet bombs precision bombs / as
 long as 23 months and I said go to America on alert / get a softball to 
 school if you work / take your child / game this afternoon / game or a 
 soccer to the president’s going to go to the game / the fight/ our new
 baseball game / to help us in our task / force will sign terrorists tracking
 American citizens / to protect level warriors / the decibel from these
 shadows / open your mail louder

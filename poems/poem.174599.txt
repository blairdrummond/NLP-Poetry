Rhymed Stanza, Series/Sequence

Dark house, by which once more I stand 
         Here in the long unlovely street, 
         Doors, where my heart was used to beat 
So quickly, waiting for a hand, 

A hand that can be clasp'd no more-- 
         Behold me, for I cannot sleep, 
         And like a guilty thing I creep 
At earliest morning to the door. 

He is not here; but far away 
         The noise of life begins again, 
         And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain 
On the bald street breaks the blank day.

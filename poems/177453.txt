In the day’s mirror 
you see a tall black man.   
Fingers of gold cattail 
tremble, then you witness 
the rope dangling from 
a limb of white oak. 
It’s come to this. 
You yell his direction, 
the wind taking   
your voice away. 
You holler his mama’s name   
& he glances up at the red sky.   
You can almost   
touch what he’s thinking,   
reaching for his hand 
across the river. 
The noose pendulous 
over his head,   
you can feel him   
grow inside you,   
straining to hoist himself,   
climbing a ladder   
of air, your feet   
in his shoes.

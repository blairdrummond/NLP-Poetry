title : The Trespasser

text : 
When last we came this pleasant way
The hedgerows blossomed, high and hard, 
And blue with shade the violets lay
In every cherry-lightened yard.

Now, in commemorative rain, 
I walk the quiet way alone, 
And there are violets again 
As blue as I have ever known.

Useless to barricade the flesh
To splendid branch and flower-row: 
I see the cherry, flaked and fresh, 
And smell the violet as I go

Perplexed past wetted flowerbed 
And boxwood glimmering into leaf, 
Companionless, disquieted, 
And fearfully as any thiefâ€”

Smarting of some sacrilege 
Too profligate to understand, 
As one who disavows a pledge 
And treads repudiated land.

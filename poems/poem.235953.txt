[At Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]
What of this house with massive walls 
   And small-paned windows, gay with blooms? 
A quaint and ancient aspect falls 
   Like pallid sunshine through the rooms. 

Not this new country's rush and haste 
   Could breed, one thinks, so still a life; 
Here is the old Moravian home, 
   A placid foe of worldly strife. 

For this roof covers, night and day, 
   The widowed women poor and old, 
The mated without mates, who say 
   Their light is out, their story told. 

To these the many mansions seem 
   Dear household fires that cannot die; 
They wait through separation dark 
   An endless union by and by. 

Each window has its watcher wan 
   To fit the autumn afternoon, 
The dropping poplar leaves, the dream 
   Of spring that faded all too soon. 

Upon the highest window-ledge 
   A glowing scarlet flower shines down. 
Oh, wistful sisterhood, whose home 
   Has sanctified this quiet town! 

Oh, hapless household, gather in 
   The tired-hearted and the lone! 
What broken homes, what sundered love, 
   What disappointment you have known! 

They count their little wealth of hope 
   And spend their waiting days in peace, 
What comfort their poor loneliness 
   Must find in every soul's release! 

And when the wailing trombones go 
   Along the street before the dead 
In that Moravian custom quaint, 
   They smile because a soul has fled.

I think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing
 how we go from day to day
 with no money. How do we
 do it, friends ask, suspecting
 we really have some stash
 stacked away somewhere.
 But we certainly do not
 and we also do not know
 how we do it either.
 You sure are lucky,
 some of our friends say. I am
 none too sure of that though,
 as I wait for the winning
 lottery numbers to be announced
 on CKLW. Thursday in Detroit
 is the day of dreams. We have
 been dreaming of a place
 in the country lately and I’m
 none too sure that is very healthy.
 And speaking of health that’s
 also been a problem that probably
 has something to do with no money,
 since we’ve all been sick lately,
 taking turns politely of course.
 Could you bring me some more
 tea one of us will ask,
 and the other will.
 In between the coughing and
 worrying our thoughts
 have often turned to crime.
 We seriously wonder how we can
 get away with a bundle with
 as little risk as possible.
 Last week we took our last
 $12 out of the bank
 and noticed how much more
 they had there though
 we had none. Of course
 we wouldn’t rob that bank,
 they know us there
 as the ones who bring
 the rolls of pennies in.
 And just yesterday they
 fish-eyed us for trying
 to cash our son’s xmas bond
 from his grandparents
 after only one month.
 So we wouldn’t try to rob that bank,
 but I do know of one up north
 that may be possible. . .
 I know this just seems like
 romantic dreaming
 but I practically make a career
 of reading detective stories,
 and God knows, I have no other.
 Anyway if the right opportunity
 comes along, we are more
 than ready to meet it.
 But this is a time of waiting,
 the I Ching says, though it does
 not say how we are to eat
 while waiting. And soon
 we will have another mouth to feed—
 Ann now in her seventh month,
 and that is often in our thoughts.
 Besides all that we are both
 over thirty, artist and poet,
 still waiting to cross the great water.
 Meanwhile, day after day,
 there is still Detroit
 to be dealt with — a small pond
 says our friend Snee.
 Big fish we used to answer him,
 but that was a while back.
 Now we think maybe Lake Erie
 is the great water referred to
 in the I Ching, and if we wait
 long enough we can
 walk across — to Buffalo
 or Cleveland. In a healthy person,
 says the philosopher, self-pity
 can be a forerunner to action:
 once the problem is seen clearly,
 a solution may be found at hand.
 And as I said, I think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing.

title : What’s Written on the Body

He will not light long enough 
for the interpreter to gather 
the tatters of his speech. 
But the longer we listen 
the calmer he becomes. 
He shows me the place where his daughter 
has rubbed with a coin, violaceous streaks 
raising a skeletal pattern on his chest. 
He thinks he’s been hit by the wind. 
He’s worried it will become pneumonia. 
In Cambodia, he’d be given 
a special tea, a prescriptive sacrifice, 
the right chants to say. But I 
know nothing of Chi, of Karma, 
and ask him to lift the back of his shirt, 
so I may listen to his breathing. 
Holding the stethoscope’s bell I’m stunned 
by the whirl of icons and script 
tattooed across his back, their teal green color 
the outline of a map which looks 
like Cambodia, perhaps his village, a lake, 
then a scroll of letters in a watery signature. 
I ask the interpreter what it means. 
It’s a spell, asking his ancestors 
to protect him from evil spirits— 
she is tracing the lines with her fingers— 
and those who meet him for kindness. 
The old man waves his arms and a staccato 
of diphthongs and nasals fills the room. 
He believes these words will lead his spirit 
back to Cambodia after he dies. 
I see, I say, and rest my hand on his shoulder. 
He takes full deep breaths and I listen, 
touching down with the stethoscope 
from his back to his front. He watches me 
with anticipation—as if awaiting a verdict. 
His lungs are clear. You’ll be fine, 
I tell him. It’s not your time to die. 
His shoulders relax and he folds his hands 
above his head as if in blessing. 
Ar-kon, he says. All better now.

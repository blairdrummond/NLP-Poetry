To a Reason 
Arthur Rimbaud 
1854-1891

France


Prose Poem, Symbolist

					
					A tap of your finger on the drum releases all sounds and initiates the new harmony.      A step of yours is the conscription of the new men and their marching orders.     You look away: the new love!     You look back,--the new love!     "Change our fates, shoot down the plagues, beginning with time," the children sing to you. "Build wherever you can the substance of our fortunes and our wishes," they beg you.     Arriving from always, you'll go away everywhere.

Sonnet

Grief dies like joy; the tears upon my cheek 
Will disappear like dew. Dear God! I know 
Thy kindly Providence hath made it so,
And thank thee for the law. I am too weak 
To make a friend of Sorrow, or to wear, 
With that dark angel ever by my side
(Though to thy heaven there be no better guide), 
A front of manly calm. Yet, for I hear
How woe hath cleansed, how grief can deify,
So weak a thing it seems that grief should die, 
And love and friendship with it, I could pray, 
That if it might not gloom upon my brow, 
Nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now,
No grief of mine should ever pass away.

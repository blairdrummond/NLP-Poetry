August, goldenrod blowing. We walk   
into the graveyard, to find 
my grandfather’s grave. Ten years ago   
I came here last, bringing 
marigolds from the round garden   
outside the kitchen. 
I didn’t know you then. 
                                  We walk 
among carved names that go with photographs 
on top of the piano at the farm: 
Keneston, Wells, Fowler, Batchelder, Buck.   
We pause at the new grave 
of Grace Fenton, my grandfather’s   
sister. Last summer 
we called on her at the nursing home,   
eighty-seven, and nodding 
in a blue housedress. We cannot find   
my grandfather’s grave. 
                                  Back at the house 
where no one lives, we potter   
and explore the back chamber 
where everything comes to rest: spinning wheels,   
pretty boxes, quilts, 
bottles, books, albums of postcards.   
Then with a flashlight we descend   
firm steps to the root cellar—black,   
cobwebby, huge, 
with dirt floors and fieldstone walls,   
and above the walls, holding the hewn   
sills of the house, enormous 
granite foundation stones. 
Past the empty bins 
for squash, apples, carrots, and potatoes, 
we discover the shelves for canning, a few 
pale pints 
of tomato left, and—what 
is this?—syrup, maple syrup   
in a quart jar, syrup 
my grandfather made twenty-five   
years ago 
for the last time. 
                           I remember 
coming to the farm in March 
in sugaring time, as a small boy. 
He carried the pails of sap, sixteen-quart   
buckets, dangling from each end   
of a wooden yoke 
that lay across his shoulders, and emptied them   
into a vat in the saphouse   
where fire burned day and night   
for a week. 
                Now the saphouse   
tilts, nearly to the ground,   
like someone exhausted 
to the point of death, and next winter 
when snow piles three feet thick   
on the roofs of the cold farm, 
the saphouse will shudder and slide   
with the snow to the ground. 
                                          Today 
we take my grandfather’s last   
quart of syrup 
upstairs, holding it gingerly, 
and we wash off twenty-five years   
of dirt, and we pull 
and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,   
dried rubber gasket, and dip our fingers 
in, you and I both, and taste 
the sweetness, you for the first time, 
the sweetness preserved, of a dead man   
in the kitchen he left 
when his body slid 
like anyone’s into the ground.

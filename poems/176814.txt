title : Two Old Crows

author : Vachel Lindsay

text : 
Two old crows sat on a fence rail. 
Two old crows sat on a fence rail, 
Thinking of effect and cause, 
Of weeds and flowers, 
And nature's laws. 
One of them muttered, one of them stuttered, 
One of them stuttered, one of them muttered. 
Each of them thought far more than he uttered. 
One crow asked the other crow a riddle. 
One crow asked the other crow a riddle: 
The muttering crow 
Asked the stuttering crow, 
“Why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle? 
Why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle?” 
“Bee-cause,” said the other crow, 
“Bee-cause, 
B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause.” 

Just then a bee flew close to their rail:— 
“Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZ.” 
And those two black crows 
Turned pale, 
And away those crows did sail. 
Why? 
B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause. 
B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause. 
“Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZ.”

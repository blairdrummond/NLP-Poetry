Come slowly - Eden! (205) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Nature, Religion, Living



Come slowly - Eden! 
Lips unused to Thee - 
Bashful - sip thy Jessamines - 
As the fainting Bee - 

Reaching late his flower, 
Round her chamber hums - 
Counts his nectars - 
Enters - and is lost in Balms.

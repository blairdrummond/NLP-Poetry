               (A Pantoum)
Of making many books there is no end, 
   Though myriads have to deep oblivion gone; 
Each day new manuscripts are being penned, 
   And still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on. 

Though myriads have to deep oblivion gone, 
   New volumes daily issue from the press; 
And still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on-- 
   The prospect is disheartening, I confess. 

New volumes daily issue from the press; 
   My pile of unread books I view aghast. 
The prospect is disheartening, I confess; 
   Why will these modern authors write so fast? 

My pile of unread books I view aghast--
   Of course I must keep fairly up to date-- 
Why will these modern authors write so fast? 
   They seem to get ahead of me of late. 

Of course I must keep fairly up to date; 
   The books of special merit I must read; 
They seem to get ahead of me of late, 
   Although I skim them very fast indeed. 

The books of special merit I must read; 
   And then the magazines come round again; 
Although I skim them very fast indeed, 
   I can't get through with more than eight or ten. 

And then the magazines come round again! 
   How can we stem this tide of printer's ink? 
I can't get through with more than eight or ten-- 
   It is appalling when I stop to think. 

How can we stem this tide of printer's ink? 
   Of making many books there is no end. 
It is appalling when I stop to think 
   Each day new manuscripts are being penned!

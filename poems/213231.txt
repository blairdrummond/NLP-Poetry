title : Onions

How easily happiness begins by   
dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter   
slithers and swirls across the floor   
of the sauté pan, especially if its   
errant path crosses a tiny slick 
of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions. 

This could mean soup or risotto   
or chutney (from the Sanskrit 
chatni, to lick). Slowly the onions   
go limp and then nacreous 
and then what cookbooks call clear,   
though if they were eyes you could see 

clearly the cataracts in them. 
It’s true it can make you weep 
to peel them, to unfurl and to tease   
from the taut ball first the brittle,   
caramel-colored and decrepit 
papery outside layer, the least 

recent the reticent onion 
wrapped around its growing body,   
for there’s nothing to an onion 
but skin, and it’s true you can go on   
weeping as you go on in, through   
the moist middle skins, the sweetest 

and thickest, and you can go on   
in to the core, to the bud-like,   
acrid, fibrous skins densely   
clustered there, stalky and in- 
complete, and these are the most   
pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare 

and rage and murmury animal   
comfort that infant humans secrete.   
This is the best domestic perfume.   
You sit down to eat with a rumor 
of onions still on your twice-washed   
hands and lift to your mouth a hint 

of a story about loam and usual   
endurance. It’s there when you clean up   
and rinse the wine glasses and make   
a joke, and you leave the minutest   
whiff of it on the light switch, 
later, when you climb the stairs.

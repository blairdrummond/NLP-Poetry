Sonnet

My spirit is too weak--mortality 
   Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, 
   And each imagined pinnacle and steep 
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die 
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. 
   Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep 
   That I have not the cloudy winds to keep 
Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye. 
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain 
   Bring round the heart an undescribable feud; 
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, 
   That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude 
Wasting of old time--with a billowy main-- 
   A sun--a shadow of a magnitude.

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
I was so sick last night I   
Didn’t hardly know my mind. 
So sick last night I 
Didn’t know my mind. 
I drunk some bad licker that   
Almost made me blind. 

Had a dream last night I   
Thought I was in hell.   
I drempt last night I   
Thought I was in hell. 
Woke up and looked around me— 
Babe, your mouth was open like a well. 

I said, Baby! Baby! 
Please don’t snore so loud.   
Baby! Please! 
Please don’t snore so loud. 
You jest a little bit o’ woman but you   
Sound like a great big crowd.

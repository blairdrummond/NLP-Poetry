What is desire 
But the hardwire argument given 
To the mind’s unstoppable mouth. 

Inside the braincase, it’s I 
Want that fills every blank. And then the hand 
Reaches for the pleasure 

The plastic snake offers. Someone says, Yes, 
It will all be fine in some future soon. 
Definitely. I’ve conjured a body 

In the chair before me. Be yourself, I tell it. 
Here memory makes you 
Unchangeable: that shirt, those summer pants. 

That beautiful face. 
That tragic beautiful mind. 
That mind’s ravenous mouth 

That told you, This isn’t poison 
At all but just what the machine needs. And then, 
The mouth closes on its hunger. 

The heart stops.

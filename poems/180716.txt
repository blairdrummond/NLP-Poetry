title : Ode I, 5: To Pyrrha

author : Horace

text : 
What slender youth, bedew’d with liquid odors, 
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave, 
             Pyrrha? For whom bind’st thou 
             In wreaths thy golden hair, 
Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he 
Of faith and changed gods complain, and seas 
             Rough with black winds, and storms 
             Unwonted shall admire! 
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold, 
Who, always vacant, always amiable 
             Hopes thee, of flattering gales 
             Unmindful. Hapless they 
To whom thou untried seem’st fair. Me, in my vow’d 
Picture, the sacred wall declares to have hung 
             My dank and dropping weeds 
             To the stern god of sea.

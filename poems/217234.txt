text : 
Forgiving the living is hard 
enough, shrugging away all the wounds 
delivered with kisses and curses, 
the thousand and one petty slights 
that bled me to an albino shade, 
that shadow me even in dreams. 

But the dead are altogether 
another matter, not easily to be 
enlightened and quite beyond regretting 
anything (as far as we can tell) 
and most likely indifferent to 
our common currency of tears. 

And so it is that pissing on your grave 
doesn't please me as much as it ought to. 
Now that you have passed beyond 
all blaming and shaming, what can I do 
but rise and proclaim sincere admiration 
when my turn comes around to speak?

Lord she’s gone done left me done packed / up and split   
and I with no way to make her 
come back and everywhere the world is bare 
bright bone white    crystal sand glistens 
dope death dead dying and jiving drove 
her away made her take her laughter and her smiles   
and her softness and her midnight sighs— 

Fuck Coltrane and music and clouds drifting in the sky   
fuck the sea and trees and the sky and birds 
and alligators and all the animals that roam the earth   
fuck marx and mao fuck fidel and nkrumah and   
democracy and communism fuck smack and pot   
and red ripe tomatoes fuck joseph fuck mary fuck   
god jesus and all the disciples fuck fanon nixon   
and malcolm fuck the revolution fuck freedom fuck   
the whole muthafucking thing 
all i want now is my woman back 
so my soul can sing

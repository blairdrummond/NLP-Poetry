dust, leaves twirling
 whirlpool
 up off road
 under wheels
 undercarriage
 automotive    winds
 turning,    lifting
 giving force to such
 delicate    particles
 ends attached in former
 position to branch
 soft paper thin petal-
 like reds and golds
 much as the mane swings
 blows back    from higher
 plane winds    Percheron    gold
 mane    that red Percheron
 on the right
 the north side
 you’ve seen her
 in the early morning
 when it’s snowing she
 raises her dignity
 laughing at motorists
 distressed by ice
 and Pueblo patrol cars
 we catch in peripheral
 focus    signal    turn the
 halogens off and on
 on and off    until
 they code the signal
 distress signal
 approaching tribal police
 traffic trap
 commuting    the
 35 mph racket
 through Nambe
 Pojoaque turn    50
 Tesuque Bingo/Pull-Tabs
 long before the lodge
 turned stone    near Camel Rock
 before the Congested Area in
 approach to the
 “City of the Oldest Catholic Church in North America”
 we convey these
 danger signs    to
 local yokels    perhaps even
 tourists    if we’re in the mood
 consideration
 strange nation
 neither of us belong
 though    we do stay
 in close    proximity to
 these other    Native peoples
 very different than where we
 come from    still the same
 only    sometimes    though
 they know the patrol
 man he’s their cousin
 all of theirs
 they know this whirl
 these leaves    rising now
 before our heated grill
 Chevy 4x    ’91
 they know the Percheron
 she steals the scenery easily
 with her laughter and turn
 pitching hoof and tail
 in mockery    indispensable humor
 she takes this morning
 under gray the shade of nickel
 to cloud the stress enabling
 me to speak to you of 
 beauty

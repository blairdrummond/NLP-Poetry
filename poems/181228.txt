text : 
Barbed wires on rusted nails can’t hold 
lone bulls at home when they smell pasture. 
They thrust their bone skulls under barbs, 
tongues quivering for a taste of strange 

and shove until the post gives way. Days later, 
we find wires sagging, reset the post, 
and tighten bent wires like a fiddle 
and rope the worn-out bull, 

wishing there was only a fence 
between us and our heart’s desire. 
But something with spurs and a rope 
would find us, cursing and yelling on horseback, 

cutting us from escape down arroyos, 
dragging us frothing and wild-eyed 
back to the sun-bleached yellow range, 
the same whirlpool of buzzards.

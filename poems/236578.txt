title : Laughing Time

author : William Jay Smith

It was laughing time, and the tall Giraffe
Lifted his head, and began to laugh:

Ha! Ha!    Ha! Ha!

And the Chimpanzee on the gingko tree
Swung merrily down with a Tee Hee Hee:

Hee! Hee!    Hee! Hee!

“It’s certainly not against the law!”
Croaked Justice Crow with a loud guffaw:

Haw! Haw!    Haw! Haw!

The dancing Bear who could never say “No”
Waltzed up and down on the tip of his toe:

Ho! Ho!    Ho! Ho!

The Donkey daintily took his paw,
And around they went:  Hee-Haw! Hee-Haw!

Hee-Haw!    Hee-Haw!

The Moon had to smile as it started to climb;
All over the world it was laughing time!

Ho! Ho!    Ho! Ho!    Hee-Haw!    Hee-Haw!
Hee! Hee!    Hee! Hee!    Ha! Ha!    Ha! Ha!

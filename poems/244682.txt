text : 
Someone said you were dead
 it’s not that I didn’t care
 You were not bacterial
 You were not frozen water in winter
 You were not a hairbrush broken by hair
 You were a treasure of gold in the world-toilet
 For you appraised the world of grains
 And flung the earth to the earth
 The good wine is mixed with the bad wine,
 come to the wine jar’s lips and let’s unmix it
 Poor people only have one soul
 but you and I have two
 let’s go on vacation to Mexico or Rome
 Everybody returns home
 How should old people associate with young people?
 Shut up—Be like a compass. The King
 has erased your name from the book of speech

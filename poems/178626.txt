title : Moss

author : Bruce Guernsey

text : 
How must it be 
to be moss, 
that slipcover of rocks?— 
imagine, 

greening in the dark, 
longing for north, 
the silence 
of birds gone south. 

How does moss do it, 
all day 
in a dank place 
and never a cough?— 

a wet dust 
where light fails, 
where the chisel 
cut the name.

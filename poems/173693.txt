title : The Negro Speaks of Rivers

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
I’ve known rivers: 
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. 

My soul has grown deep like the rivers. 

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. 
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. 
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it. 
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset. 

I’ve known rivers: 
Ancient, dusky rivers. 

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

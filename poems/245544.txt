Numanah, Grandfather, grant me the grace
 of a new song far from this lament
 of lame words and fossils of a losing game.
 No more flat pebbles skimmed between the wetness
 of tongue and thigh and eye again!
 I never asked to be the son of a stained mattress
 who contemplated venison stew and knew
 the shame hidden in grease clouds stuck to the wall
 behind the woodstove where Grandmother cooked.
 I only wanted to run far, so far from Indian land.
 And, God damn it, when I was old enough I did.
 I loitered in some great halls of ivy
 and allowed the inquisition of education:
 electric cattle prods placed lovingly
 to the lobes of my earth memories.
 I carried the false spirit force of sadness
 wrapped in a brown sack in the pocket
 of a worn, tweed coat.
 In junkie alleyways I whispered of forgotten arrows
 in the narrow passages of my own discarded history.
 Then, when I was old enough
 I ran back to Indian land.
 Now I’m thinking of running from here.

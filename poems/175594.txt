text : 
And a tenth part of Okeanos is given to dark night 
   a tithe of the pure water    under    earth 
so that the clear fountains pour from rock face, 
   tears stream from the caverns and clefts, 
   down-running, carving woundrous ways in basalt resistance,   
   cutting deep as they go into layers of time-layerd 
         Gaia where She sleeps— 

the cold water, the black rushing gleam, the   
   moving down-rush, wash, gush out over   
   bed-rock, toiling the boulders in flood,   
   purling in deeps, broad flashing in falls— 

And a tenth part of bright clear Okeanos 
   his circulations— mists, rains, sheets, sheathes— 
   lies in poisonous depths, the black water. 

Styx    this carver of caverns beneath us is.   
Styx    this black water,    this down-pouring. 

The well is deep.    From its stillness   
   the words our voices speak      echo.   
   Resonance follows resonance. 
   Waves of this sounding come up to us. 

   We draw the black water, pure and cold.   
   The light of day is not as bright   
   as this crystal flowing. 

Three thousand years we have recited its virtue   
   out of Hesiod. 
                                                    Is it twenty-five thousand   
since the ice withdrew from the lands    and we 
came forth from the realm of caverns where 
the river beneath the earth    we knew 
      we go back to. 
Styx pouring down in the spring from its glacial remove,   
      from the black ice. 

Fifty million years—from the beginning of what we are— 
      we knew the depth of this well to be. 

      Fifty million years deep    —but our knowing deepens   
            —time deepens— 
                                     this still water 

we thirst for      in dreams we dread.

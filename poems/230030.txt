title : Salvation

text : 
Finally, I gave up on obeisance, 
and refused to welcome 
either retribution or the tease 

of sunny days. As for the can’t-be- 
seen, the sum-of-all-details, 
the One—oh, when it came 

to salvation I was only sure 
I needed to be spared 
someone else’s version of it. 

The small prayers I devised 
had in them the hard sounds 
of split and frost. 

I wanted them to speak 
as if it made sense to speak 
to what isn’t there 

in the beaconless dark. 
I wanted them to startle 
by how little they asked.

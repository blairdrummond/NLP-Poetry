title : Weaponry

text : 
I used an arrow to kill the spider.   
I used a steamroller to flatten the worm.   

For the ants I called in an air strike.   
Bee that found its way in through the screen:   

blowtorch.   
The mammals were easier—   

a bucket of water for submerging the cat,   
a poisoned word thrown to the dog.   

For love, only a kitchen match. That   
and a stove leaking gas   

and waiting until the dinner   
was good and burned.

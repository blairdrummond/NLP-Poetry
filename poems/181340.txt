text : 
The tortoise walks on tiptoe in June, 
the month of his ardors.
Buttery light, distant thunder
in the month of my ardors.
                                                              _
 
Flailing boughs, coral lime 
in the wind and verdure. 
Then silence, dark creamy 
shadows in nighttime verdure. 
                                                              _
 
The moon traversing the garden,
florals made of a blush or a breath, 
nightbirds with a little lump
of insect under their tongues, breath 
                                                              _
 
of clover, grassy, spiced, 
and all of it rinsed of emotion. 
The leaden nymph by the gate. 
All, all rinsed of emotion. 
                                                              _
 
By what bough are the fireflies 
hidden, and the stars? 
The night’s leavings in daylight 
lie hidden like the stars.

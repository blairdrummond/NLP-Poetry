title : jesus knew

unlike you and I jesus knew he’d die 

some days a headache woke him it 

lingered nothing terrible but the word 

hung around his temples like this 

soul everyone wants but can’t find jesus 

knew he’d die he just didn’t know how 

& that bothered him sometimes & then 

he’d do one of his little bootleg tricks 

what the hell, didn’t hurt anyone 

didn’t make anyone disappear for- 

ever but the tricks stopped working he forgot 

why he did them & what for he confused 

a story about a guy named jesus 

with a story about a father he never knew 

& it all began to hang like a motheaten coat 

pulled out of a trunk on shaky days hey let’s 

return to the scene of the fucken tragedy at least 

we all know how it turns out instead of this end- 

less uncertainty hey let’s sell our souls a few 

more times no one’s really counting (those 

little papers you trade for your sins, 

what do you call them? anyone? no?) 

—anyway—jesus this jesus that 

god of nickel god of dime 

right, the real jesus he was lost he walked in- 

to the desert not far really his friends his 

disciples he told them he’d come back 

like us he said this every time he left but jesus 

never said wait never pointed to the sky 

never claimed he’d rise again never asked us to eat 

his flesh jesus never asked anything as far 

as I can tell he got tired everyday & then slept 

sometimes okay sometimes un- 

bearable, the dreams, the father 

pointing a finger at everyone a finger we can’t 

even look at.

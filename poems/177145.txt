title : Recitation

author : Scott Cairns

text : 
He did not fall then, blind upon a road,   
nor did his lifelong palsy disappear.   
He heard no voice, save the familiar, 

ceaseless, self-interrogation 
of the sore perplexed. The kettle steamed   
and whistled. A heavy truck downshifted 

near the square. He heard a child calling,   
and heard a mourning dove intone its one   
dull call. For all of that, his wits remained 

quite dim. He breathed and spoke the words he read.   
If what had been long dead then came alive,   
that resurrection was by all appearances 

metaphorical. The miracle arrived 
without display. He held a book, and as he read   
he found the very thing he’d sought. Just that. 

A life with little hurt but one, the lucky gift   
of a raveled book, a kettle slow to heat,   
and time enough therefore to lift the book 

and find in one slight passage the very wish   
he dared not ask aloud, until, that is,   
he spoke the words he read.

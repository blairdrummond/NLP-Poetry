The seas has made a wall for its defence 
of falling water. Those whose impertinence 
leads them to its moving ledges 
it rejects. Those who surrender 
it will with the next wave drag under. 

Sand is the beginning and the end 
of our dominion. 

The way to the dunes is easy. 
The shelving sand is stiffened in the rain 
and loosened again in the sun’s fingers. 
Children, lustful of the glistening hours 
drink and are insatiate. Wind under the eyelids, 
confusion walling their ears, their bodies glow 
in the cold wash of the beach. 
                                              And after, 
they walk with rigid feet the planked street of the town.   
They miss the slipping texture of the sand 
and a sand pillow under the hollow instep.   
They are unmoved by fears 
that breed in darkening kitchens at sundown 
following storm, and they rebel 
against cold waiting in the wind and rain 
for the late sail. 

                           Did you, as I, 
condemn the coastal fog and long for islands 
seen from a sail’s shadow? 
                                        The dunes lie 
more passive to the wind than water is.   
This, then, the country of our choice. 

It is infertile, narrow, prone   
under a dome of choral sound:   
water breaking upon water. 

Litter of bare logs in the drift— 
the sea has had its sharp word with them. 
Wild roses, wild strawberries cover the dune shoulder   
It is a naked restless garden that descends   
from the crouched pine 
to shellfish caught in flat reflecting sands. 

We lose the childish avarice of horizons. The sea ends   
against another shore. The cracked ribs of a wreck   
project from the washed beach. 
Under the shell-encrusted timbers 
dripping brine 
plucks at the silence of slant chambers 
opening seaward. What moving keel remembers   
such things as here are buried under sand? 

The transitory ponds and smooth bar slide 
easily under the advancing tide,   
emerging with the moon’s   
turning. 
            Clear lagoons 
behind the shattered hulk, thin   
movements of sea grass on the dune rim 
bending against cloud, these things are oursI 
Submissive to the sea and wind,   
resistful of all else, sand 
is the beginning and the end   
of our dominion.

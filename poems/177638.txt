title : Opera Bouffe

author : Philip Gross

text : 
The count of cappuccino, 
the marquise of meringue, 
all the little cantuccini...
and what was the song they sang? 

Oh, the best of us is nothing   
but a sweetening of the air,   
a tryst between the teeth and tongue: 
we meet and no one’s there   

though the café’s always crowded   
as society arrives 
and light glints to and fro between   
the eyes and rings and knives. 

We’ll slip away together,   
perfect ghosts of appetite,   
the balancing of ash on fire 
and whim—the mating flight 

of amaretti papers,   
my petite montgolfiere,   
our lit cage rising weightless   
up the lift shaft of the air.   

So the count of cappuccino, 
the marquise of not much more,
consumed each other’s hunger. 
Then the crash. And then the war.

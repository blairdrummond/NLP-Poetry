title : Better or Worse

I. 

Daily, the kindergarteners   
passed my porch. I loved   
their likeness and variety,   
their selves in line like little   
monosyllables, but huggable— 
I wasn't meant 

to grab them, ever, 
up into actual besmooches or down   
into grubbiest tumbles, my lot was not   
to have them, in the flesh. 
Was it better or worse to let 
their lovability go by untouched, and just   
watch over their river of ever- 
inbraiding relations? I wouldn't 
mother them or teach. We couldn't be   
each other's others; maybe, 
at removes, each other's each. 

   II. 

Each toddler had a hand-hold on 
a loop of rope, designed to haul 
the whole school onward   
in the sidewalk stream— 
like pickerel through freshets, 
at the pull of something else's will, the children 
spun and bobbled, three years old and four 
(or were they little drunken Buddhas, 
buoyant, plump?). They looked 
now to the right, now to the sky, and now 
toward nothing (nothing was too small)— 
they followed a thread of destination, 
chain of command, order of actual rope that led 

to what? Who knew? 

For here and now in one child's eye there was a yellow truck, 
and in another's was a burning star; but from my own perspective, 
overhead, adult, where trucks and suns had lost their luster,   
they were one whole baby-rush toward 
a target, toward the law 
of targets, fledge 
in the wake of an arrowhead; 

a bull's-eye bloomed, a red   
eight-sided sign. What   
did I wish them? 
Nothing I foresaw.

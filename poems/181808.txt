title : Elegy to the Sioux

The vase was made of clay 
With spines of straw 
For strength. The sunbaked vase 
Soaked in a deep blue dye for days. The events in this wilderness, 
Portrayed in the round of the vase, 

Depend on shades of indigo against 
The masked areas of the clay, a flat pearl color 
To detail the big sky and snow... 

This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful: 
A bugle skips through notes: 

We view it all somehow from the center of the field 
And there are scattered groups of cavalry. Some of these 
Men were seasoned by civil war. Their caps are blue. 
Their canteens are frozen. The horses shake their heads 
Bothered by beads of ice, the needles of ice 
Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads. 

The long, blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches 
Of the horses. The ammunition wagons 
Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather... 

Beyond the wagons, farther even, into the woods 
There is a sloping streambed. This is 
The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood. 
From here through the bare trees there’s 
A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field: 

A valet is holding a bowl of cherries—archetype and rubric, 
A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color 
Which will flow through the woods in early December. 

An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth, unattended 
In the deep wash inside the woods. She knew the weather 

Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees 
To the earth to make a roof. 
The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth. Her legs spread, 
He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce. No stars 
Show through! But on the vase that belonged to a President 
There are countless stars above the soldiers’ campfires... 

With rawhide her feet are tied high in the spruce 
And her right hand is left loose as if she were about 
To ride a wild stallion 
                            to its conclusion in a box canyon. 

President Grant drinks bourbon from his boot. The Sioux 
Cough in their blankets... 

It snowed an hour more, and then the moon appeared. The 
                  unborn infant, 
Almost out on the forest floor, buckled and lodged. It died. 
Its mother died. Just before she closed her eyes 
She rubbed snow up and down inside of her bare thighs. 

In the near field an idle, stylish horse raised one leg 
To make a perfect right angle. Just then a ghost of snow formed 
Over the tents of the soldiers, 

It blows past the stylish, gray horse, 
Unstopped it moves through woods, up the streambed, 
And passes into the crude spruce shelter, into the raw open 
Woman, her legs raised into sky— 
Naked house of snow and ice! This gust of wind 

Spent the night within the woman. At sunrise, it left her mouth 
Tearing out trees, keeping the owls from sleep; it was angry now 
And into the field it spilled, into the bivouac of pony soldiers 
Who turned to the south, who turned back to the woods, who became 

Still. Blue all over! If there is snow still unspooling in the mountains 
Then there is time yet for the President to get his Indian vase 
And to fill it with bourbon from his boot and to put flowers into it: 
The flowers die in a window that looks out on a cherry tree 
Which heavy with fruit drops a branch: 
                                                            
                                                       torn to its very heartwood 
By the red clusters of fruit, the branch fell 
Like her leg and foot 
Out of the sky into Montana...

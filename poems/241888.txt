title : Grass

author : Joyce Sidman

text : 
I grow in places
others can’t,
 
where wind is high
and water scant.
 
I drink the rain,
I eat the sun;
 
before the prairie winds
I run.
 
I see, I sprout,
I grow, I creep,
 
and in the ice
and snow, I sleep.
 
On steppe or veld
or pampas dry,
 
beneath the grand,
enormous sky,
 
I make my humble,
bladed bed.
 
And where there’s level ground,
 I spread.

title : Lint

It doesn’t bother me to have 
lint in the bottoms of pant pockets; 
it gives the hands something to do, 
especially since I no longer hold 
shovel, hod, or hammer 
in the daylight hours of labor 
and haven’t, in fact, done so 
in twenty-five years. A long time 
to be picking lint from pockets. 
Perhaps even long enough to have 
gathered sacks full of lint 
that could have been put  
to good use, maybe spun into yarn 
to knit a sweater for my wife’s 
Christmas present, or strong thread 
whirled and woven into a tweedy jacket. 
Imagine entering my classroom 
in a jacket made from lint. 
Who would believe it? 
Yet there are stranger things— 
the son of a bricklayer with hands 
so smooth they’re only fit 
for picking lint.

title : Driving West in 1970

author : Robert Bly

text : 
My dear children, do you remember the morning
 When we climbed into the old Plymouth
 And drove west straight toward the Pacific?

 We were all the people there were.
 We followed Dylan's songs all the way west.
 It was Seventy; the war was over, almost;

 And we were driving to the sea.
 We had closed the farm, tucked in
 The flap, and were eating the honey

 Of distance and the word "there."
 Oh whee, we're gonna fly 
 Down into the easy chair. We sang that

 Over and over. That's what the early
 Seventies were like. We weren't afraid.
 And a hole had opened in the world.

 We laughed at Las Vegas.
 There was enough gaiety
 For all of us, and ahead of us was

 The ocean. Tomorrow's 
 The day my bride's gonna come.
 And the war was over, almost.

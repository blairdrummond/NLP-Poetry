title : Ghetto Funeral

author : Charles Reznikoff

text : 
Followed by his lodge, shabby men stumbling over the 
    cobblestones,   
and his children, faces red and ugly with tears, eyes and 
    eyelids red, 
in the black coffin in the black hearse the old man. 

No longer secretly grieving 
that his children are not strong enough to go the way he 
    wanted to go 
and was not strong enough.

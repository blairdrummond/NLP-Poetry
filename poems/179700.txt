title : Into Death Bravely

author : Jimmy Santiago Baca

text : 
Winter 
throws his great white shield 
on the ground, 
breaking thin arms of twisting branches, 
and then howls 
on the north side of the Black Mesa 
a deep, throaty laughter. 
Because of him 
we have to sell our cattle 
that rake snow for stubble. 
Having lived his whole life 
in a few weeks, 
slow and pensive he walks away, 
dragging his silver-stream shield 
down branches 
and over the ground, 
he keeps walking slowly away 
into death 
bravely.

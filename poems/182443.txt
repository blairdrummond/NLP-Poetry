title : Primer For Blacks

author : Gwendolyn Brooks

Blackness 
is a title, 
is a preoccupation, 
is a commitment Blacks 
are to comprehend— 
and in which you are 
to perceive your Glory. 

The conscious shout 
of all that is white is 
“It’s Great to be white.” 
The conscious shout 
of the slack in Black is 
"It's Great to be white." 
Thus all that is white 
has white strength and yours. 

The word Black 
has geographic power, 
pulls everybody in: 
Blacks here— 
Blacks there— 
Blacks wherever they may be. 
And remember, you Blacks, what they told you— 
remember your Education: 
“one Drop—one Drop 
maketh a brand new Black.” 
         Oh mighty Drop. 
______And because they have given us kindly 
so many more of our people 

Blackness 
stretches over the land. 
Blackness— 
the Black of it, 
the rust-red of it, 
the milk and cream of it, 
the tan and yellow-tan of it, 
the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it, 
the “olive” and ochre of it— 
Blackness 
marches on. 

The huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride 
is to Comprehend, 
to salute and to Love the fact that we are Black, 
which is our “ultimate Reality,” 
which is the lone ground 
from which our meaningful metamorphosis, 
from which our prosperous staccato, 
group or individual, can rise. 

Self-shriveled Blacks. 
Begin with gaunt and marvelous concession: 
YOU are our costume and our fundamental bone. 
       
      All of you— 
      you COLORED ones, 
      you NEGRO ones, 
those of you who proudly cry 
      “I’m half INDian”— 
      those of you who proudly screech 
      “I’VE got the blood of George WASHington in MY veins” 
      ALL of you— 
            you proper Blacks, 
      you half-Blacks, 
      you wish-I-weren’t Blacks, 
      Niggeroes and Niggerenes. 


      You.

title : The Rain

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
All night the sound had
 come back again,
 and again falls
 this quiet, persistent rain.
  
 What am I to myself
 that must be remembered,
 insisted upon
 so often? Is it
  
 that never the ease,
 even the hardness,
 of rain falling
 will have for me
  
 something other than this,
 something not so insistent—
 am I to be locked in this
 final uneasiness.
  
 Love, if you love me,
 lie next to me.
 Be for me, like rain,
 the getting out
  
 of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-
 lust of intentional indifference.
 Be wet
 with a decent happiness.

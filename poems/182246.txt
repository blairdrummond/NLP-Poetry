Of Mina-sarpilili-anda II, 
the only surviving record 
is this splendid bas-relief in which 
he presses the neck of his Hittite foe 
beneath one battle-shod foot 
while minions shoulder the spoils 
of a conquered city. 

                                                                   In fact 
there was no war that year; a bored stone-carver 
was looking for preferment. He received 
an allowance of good wine. 
In a perfumed cloud of dust 
that loitered over the plain, 
Hittite ambassadors came to the king 
with golden bells and rosewater candy, 
birds in cages and spotted cats, 
and departed in peace. The king was beloved, 
laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed 
of poison. 

                                  A carnelian image 
of his second-best wife, 
accurate to the last mole, was plucked 
from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, 
and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, 
on a ship that sank on a cloudless day. 
An image of his first wife, in chrysoprase, 
lies tightly packed in buried rubble 
for the next generation of archaeologists— 
should they prove worthy, 
persistent, 
and slyer than goatherds.

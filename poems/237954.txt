title : Seven Spell

author : Reb Livingston

text : 
conjured in a closet;
seven minutes in a delusive boon

deep breaths shallow,
ankles stretched, entwined

ribs padded with throbs,
bells and trance

it never ended and then
it ended

the spell distant,
retrospect, precious

the doorways, hall-
ways, the fleeting pitter

patters gaze
up a long flight of stairs

somethingâ€™s still
there to behold

is it sorcery or charm?
invoke a comely name for it

recall your palms
flattening my thrum,

my thrum, my good judgment groped,
ravaged, delirious

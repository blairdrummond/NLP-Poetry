       1 

Come, my Lucasia, since we see
      That Miracles Mens faith do move,
By wonder and by prodigy
      To the dull angry world let's prove
      There's a Religion in our Love.


       2 

For though we were design'd t' agree,
      That Fate no liberty destroyes,
But our Election is as free
      As Angels, who with greedy choice
      Are yet determin'd to their joyes.


       3 

Our hearts are doubled by the loss,
      Here Mixture is Addition grown ;
We both diffuse, and both ingross :
      And we whose minds are so much one,
      Never, yet ever are alone.


       4 

We court our own Captivity
      Than Thrones more great and innocent :
'Twere banishment to be set free,
      Since we wear fetters whose intent
      Not Bondage is, but Ornament.


       5 

Divided joyes are tedious found,
      And griefs united easier grow :
We are our selves but by rebound,
      And all our Titles shuffled so,
      Both Princes, and both Subjects too.


       6 

Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid,
      While they (such power in Friendship lies)
Are Altars, Priests, and Off'rings made :
      And each Heart which thus kindly dies,
      Grows deathless by the Sacrifice.

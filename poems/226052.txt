title : Too Many Daves

author : Theodor Geisel

text : 
Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave 
Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave? 
Well, she did.   And that wasn't a smart thing to do. 
You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo! 
Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one. 
All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run! 
This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves' 
As you can imagine, with so many Daves. 
And often she wishes that, when they were born, 
She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn 
And one of them Hoos-Foos.   And one of them Snimm. 
And one of them Hot-Shot.   And one Sunny Jim. 
And one of them Shadrack.   And one of them Blinkey. 
And one of them Stuffy.   And one of them Stinkey. 
Another one Putt-Putt.   Another one Moon Face. 
Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face. 
And one of them Ziggy.   And one Soggy Muff. 
One Buffalo Bill.   And one Biffalo Buff. 
And one of them Sneepy.   And one Weepy Weed. 
And one Paris Garters.   And one Harris Tweed. 
And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt 
And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt 
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate ... 
But she didn't do it.   And now it's too late.

title : The Indifferent Shepherdess to Colin

author : Ann Yearsley

text : 
Colin, why this mistake?
   Why plead thy foolish love?
My heart shall sooner break
   Than I a minion prove;
Nor care I half a rush,
   No snare I spread for thee:
Go home, my friend, and blush
   For love and liberty.

Remembrance is my own —
   Dominion bright and clear,
Truth there was ever known
   To combat every care:
One image there impressed
   Through life shall ever be
Whilst my innocuous breast
   Owns love of liberty.

I ever taught thee how
   To prize the soul entire,
When on the mountain’s brow
   I turned my rural lyre:
Thou servile art and vain,
   Thy love unworthy me!
Away! nor hear my strain,
   Of love or liberty.

What arts need I display
   To woo a soul like thine?
Thou ne’re canst know the way
   My memory to confine;
For my eternal plan
   Is to be calm and free.
Estranged from tyrant man
   I’ll keep my liberty.

Yon woods their foliage wear,
   Be thou away or nigh;
The warblers of the year
   Instruct me not to sigh:
My tears ne’er roll the steep,
   Nor swell the restless sea,
Except for those who sleep
   Bereft of liberty.

Slave to commanding eyes!
   Those eyes thou wouldst commend
My judgment must despise —
   My pity is thy friend:
If eyes alone can move
   A swain so dull as thee,
They mean but to reprove
   Thy loss of liberty.

I stray o’er rocks and fields
   Where native beauties shine:
All fettered fancy yields
   Be, Colin, ever thine.
Complain no more! but rove —
   My cheek from crimson free,
Within my native grove
   I’ll guard my liberty.

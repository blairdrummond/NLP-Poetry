title : Three Songs at the End of Summer

author : Jane Kenyon

text : 
A second crop of hay lies cut   
and turned. Five gleaming crows   
search and peck between the rows. 
They make a low, companionable squawk,   
and like midwives and undertakers   
possess a weird authority. 

Crickets leap from the stubble,   
parting before me like the Red Sea.   
The garden sprawls and spoils. 

Across the lake the campers have learned   
to water ski. They have, or they haven’t.   
Sounds of the instructor’s megaphone   
suffuse the hazy air. “Relax! Relax!” 

Cloud shadows rush over drying hay,   
fences, dusty lane, and railroad ravine.   
The first yellowing fronds of goldenrod   
brighten the margins of the woods. 

Schoolbooks, carpools, pleated skirts;   
water, silver-still, and a vee of geese. 

* 

The cicada’s dry monotony breaks   
over me. The days are bright   
and free, bright and free. 

Then why did I cry today   
for an hour, with my whole   
body, the way babies cry? 

* 

A white, indifferent morning sky,   
and a crow, hectoring from its nest   
high in the hemlock, a nest as big   
as a laundry basket ... 
                                    In my childhood   
I stood under a dripping oak, 
while autumnal fog eddied around my feet,   
waiting for the school bus 
with a dread that took my breath away. 

The damp dirt road gave off   
this same complex organic scent. 

I had the new books—words, numbers,   
and operations with numbers I did not   
comprehend—and crayons, unspoiled   
by use, in a blue canvas satchel 
with red leather straps. 

Spruce, inadequate, and alien   
I stood at the side of the road.   
It was the only life I had.

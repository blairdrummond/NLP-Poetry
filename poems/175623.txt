text : 
With her one horrid eye persistently unfastened, a vigilant bird 
watched my grandfather during the Great Depression 
use each evening of one whole year to wander his corn fields 
knowing this world is just one pig after another 

in one pen after another. Therefore, the bird heard him suppose, 
shouldn’t he with his best gun, machete, Buick, or rope 
terminate his acquaintance with the tiresome setup 
of breakfast-lunch-dinner-dawn-dusk-fall-winter-spring-summer- 

blah-blah-blah? But his girls were good-looking 
and made such fine pies, so the bird watched him live wretchedly 
until he died more naturally of cancer 
too soon to see his people become the dopefiends, doctor-haters, 

masturbators, insomniacs, sleep fanatics, shut-ins, and teetotalers 
the bird knew they would become, for the purpose of girls 
is to just ruin everything with wanton reproduction 
so that now now now it’s really relentless—how heavy 

his people got in their limbs and how torrential, thus, 
the frenzied wind, though beyond the eye of the bird 
is the small, ashen brain of the bird, and below that, a heart, 
I swear, through which come the iffy notes of this cruel song.

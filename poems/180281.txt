title : The Sight

author : David Orr

text : 
My Uncle Fletcher, 
Our county seer, 

Bestowed his gifts 
On my no-good cousin Jeff, 

Who had a feeling 
About nearly everything. 

"That guy of hers . . ." 
"Those fucking queers . . ." 

He'd say, giving me the eye, 
Which was the same eye 

That could gaze upon 
A yellow froth of newborns, 

And know the cockerels 
From the pullets.

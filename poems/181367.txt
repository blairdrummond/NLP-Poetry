title : The Son of the Wall

author : Avot Yeshurun

text : 
The Christian cannot   
be the pitying one 
because he is 
the one pitied. 

From a dusty road 
in a straight line 
from przedmiescie to Krasnystaw 
at the entrance to town 

at Zhitkovski's   
in his house we lived, 
he makes coffins 
with crosses. 

On the threshold 
I sat as a boy 
opposite a building 
held together by nails 

facing the church 
the cloister the impurity, 
my mother says, 
I sat as a boy. 

On the wall 
Jesus and Mary. 
Jesus and his mother 
were never parted. 

My mother's son 
left her 
not to be 
on the wall. 

Mary's son   
never left, 
and he paid 
the price.

					A woman was fighting a tree. The tree had come to rage at the woman’s attack, breaking free from its earth it waddled at her with its great root feet.          Goddamn these sentiencies, roared the tree with birds shrieking in its branches.          Look out, you’ll fall on me, you bastard, screamed the woman as she hit at the tree.          The tree whisked and whisked with its leafy branches.          The woman kicked and bit screaming, kill me kill me or I’ll kill you!           Her husband seeing the commotion came running crying, what tree has lost patience?          The ax the ax, damnfool, the ax, she screamed.          Oh no, roared the tree dragging its long roots rhythmically limping like a sea lion towards her husband.          But oughtn’t we to talk about this? cried her husband.          But oughtn’t we to talk about this, mimicked his wife.          But what is this all about? he cried.          When you see me killing something you should reason that it will want to kill me back, she screamed.           But before her husband could decide what next action to perform the tree had killed both the wife and her husband.          Before the woman died she screamed, now do you see?          He said, what...? And then he died.

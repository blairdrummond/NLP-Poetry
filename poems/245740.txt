title : Still Life with a Bedroom on an Airshaft

author : Nuar Alsadir

text : 
A neighbor’s light switches on in a window
across the airshaft, absorbs the darkness
like a person eager to speak.
 
There’s a grainy stillness to all,
as though the sleepers had been painted,
as though they became what the painter
 
layered over in shifting focus
from the couple to the unspoken,
which slips like a mouse between dreams.
 
You’d have to take a step back to see them:
up close they are nothing more than a cluster
of syllables, your name, what you say
 
when the only words you hold are stones
that were thrown against the window
of your childhood fears while you pretended to sleep.

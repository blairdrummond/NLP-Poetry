Stasis in darkness. 
Then the substanceless blue   
Pour of tor and distances. 

God's lioness,   
How one we grow, 
Pivot of heels and knees!--The furrow 

Splits and passes, sister to   
The brown arc 
Of the neck I cannot catch, 

Nigger-eye   
Berries cast dark   
Hooks--

Black sweet blood mouthfuls,   
Shadows. 
Something else 

Hauls me through air--
Thighs, hair; 
Flakes from my heels. 

White 
Godiva, I unpeel--
Dead hands, dead stringencies. 

And now I 
Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.   
The child's cry 

Melts in the wall.   
And I 
Am the arrow, 

The dew that flies 
Suicidal, at one with the drive   
Into the red 

Eye, the cauldron of morning.

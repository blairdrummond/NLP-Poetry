You can see the face of everything, and it is white-- 
plaster, nightmare, adobe, anemia, cold-- 
turned to the east. Oh closeness to life! 
Hardness of life! Like something 
in the body that is animal--root, slag-ends-- 
with the soul still not set well there-- 
and mineral and vegetable! 
Sun standing stiffly against man, 
against the sow, the cabbages, the mud wall! 
--False joy, because you are merely 
in time, as they say, and not in the soul! 

   The entire sky taken up   
by moist and steaming heaps, 
a horizon of dung piles.   
Sour remains, here and there,   
of the night. Slices 
of the green moon, half-eaten, 
crystal bits from false stars, 
plaster, the paper ripped off, still faintly 
sky-blue. The birds 
not really awake yet, in the raw moon, 
streetlight nearly out.   
Mob of beings and things! 
--A true sadness, because you are really deep 
in the soul, as they say, not in time at all!

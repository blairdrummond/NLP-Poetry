title : [From behind, standing, from a distance]

author : Patrizia Cavalli

text : 
From behind, standing, from a distance, 
in passing, the taxi meter running, 
I'd watch her, I'd watch her hair, 
and what would I see? My stubborn theatre, 
curtain won't fall, my always-open theatre . . . 
Best to leave as soon as the show begins.

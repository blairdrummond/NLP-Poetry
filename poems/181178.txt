title : The Red Portrait

author : Karl Kirchwey

text : 
Last night she came to me, my mother, dead: 
but as she was in the photo, that last Christmas, 
wearing a red dress, and her lipstick was red 
(I wonder if that means she lives in hell), 
and I saw again that she was beautiful, 
the same high forehead I have, the same wide brow, 
and just my age, forty-nine; and now I was 
talking fast, because I knew I had no time, 
and I told her I loved her, I told her how her life 
had informed mine, and I begged her to come 
to me again, to meet my children, my wife. 
I said to herâ€”My work, see what I have made, 
I have tried to do what you did not live to do. 
But she smiled at me and began to fade.

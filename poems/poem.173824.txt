Elegy, Rhymed Stanza

Child of a day, thou knowest not
         The tears that overflow thy urn,
The gushing eyes that read thy lot,
         Nor, if thou knewest, couldst return!

And why the wish! the pure and blest
         Watch like thy mother o'er thy sleep.
O peaceful night! O envied rest!
         Thou wilt not ever see her weep.

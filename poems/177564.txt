title : A Wolf Is at the Laundromat

author : Jack Prelutsky

text : 
A wolf is at the Laundromat, 
it's not a wary stare-wolf, 
it's short and fat, it tips its hat, 
unlike a scary glare-wolf. 

It combs its hair, it clips its toes, 
it is a fairly rare wolf, 
that's only there to clean its clothesâ€” 
it is a wash-and-wear-wolf.

Tell me if this is all true, my lover? 
         tell me if it is true.
When the eyes of me flash their lightning on you, 
         dark clouds in your breast make stormy answer;
Is it then true 
         that the dew drops fall from the night when I am seen, 
         and the morning light is glad when it wraps my body?

Is it true, is it true, that your love 
         travelled alone through ages and worlds in search of me? 
         that when you found me at last, your age-long desire 
         found utter peace in my gentle speech and my eyes and lips and flowing hair?

Is it then true 
         that the mystery of the Infinite is written on this little brow of mine?         
Tell me, my lover, if all this is true!

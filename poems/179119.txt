title : Bells for John Whiteside’s Daughter

author : John Crowe Ransom

text : 
There was such speed in her little body,   
And such lightness in her footfall,   
It is no wonder her brown study 
Astonishes us all. 

Her wars were bruited in our high window.   
We looked among orchard trees and beyond   
Where she took arms against her shadow,   
Or harried unto the pond 

The lazy geese, like a snow cloud 
Dripping their snow on the green grass,   
Tricking and stopping, sleepy and proud,   
Who cried in goose, Alas, 

For the tireless heart within the little   
Lady with rod that made them rise 
From their noon apple-dreams and scuttle   
Goose-fashion under the skies! 

But now go the bells, and we are ready,   
In one house we are sternly stopped 
To say we are vexed at her brown study,   
Lying so primly propped.

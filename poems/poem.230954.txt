Blank Verse

"I grant you ample leave 
To use the hoary formula 'I am' 
Naming the emptiness where thought is not; 
But fill the void with definition, 'I' 
Will be no more a datum than the words 
You link false inference with, the 'Since' & 'so' 
That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl. 
Resolve your 'Ego', it is all one web 
With vibrant ether clotted into worlds: 
Your subject, self, or self-assertive 'I' 
Turns nought but object, melts to molecules, 
Is stripped from naked Being with the rest 
Of those rag-garments named the Universe. 
Or if, in strife to keep your 'Ego' strong 
You make it weaver of the etherial light, 
Space, motion, solids & the dream of Time -- 
Why, still 'tis Being looking from the dark, 
The core, the centre of your consciousness, 
That notes your bubble-world: sense, pleasure, pain, 
What are they but a shifting otherness, 
Phantasmal flux of moments? --"

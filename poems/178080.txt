title : Heart, My Box of Snow

made it to Florida   
and then I went for a walk.    
The frog pond is half-iced over.   
I chucked a stick at it—   
still thin. On the white side,    
the wind twirled a leaf around    
like a prepubescent figure skater   
who’s given up her childhood   
to get here. Of course, the leaf   
was wearing its practice costume   
of browns, the whole world    
offed of spangles as I am    
offed of you. Why    
mail snow? Just to show   
I could keep it cold   
in so much heat.

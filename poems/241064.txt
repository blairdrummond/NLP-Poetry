title : The Progression

author : Omar Pérez

text : 
When one isn’t enough, you need two
 when two aren’t enough, you need four
 with four the progression begins, moving toward a number
 that schoolteachers will call absurd. 
 Question: How many men do you need
 to put up a house? 
 Answer: You need absurd men
 when one isn’t enough and two can’t do
 the work of One. 
 And how much money should we give these men
 to compensate them?
 You need absurd coins when one coin
 sliced in half and handed out 
 isn’t enough. 
 And how many words do you need to
        transform them?
 Absurd and absurd and absurd words
 when silence isn’t enough. 
 This is what they call progression:
 Absurd men aren’t enough for putting up the house,
 absurd coins don’t make them happy
 absurd words can’t dissuade them.

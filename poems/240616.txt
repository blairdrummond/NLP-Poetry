             noctes illustratas
              (the night has houses)
                                                       and the shadow of the fabulous
                                           broken into handfuls—these
 can be placed at regular intervals,
                                                          candles
 walking down the streets at times eclipsed by trees.
  

  
  

  
  
  
  
  
 Certain cells, it’s said, can generate light on their own.
  
 There are organisms that could fit on the head of a pin
 and light entire rooms.
  
 Throughout the Middle Ages, you could hire a man
 on any corner with a torch to light you home
  
                                                                 were lamps made of horn
 and from above a loom of moving flares, we watched
 Notre Dame seem small.
 Now the streets and stand still.
  
 By 1890, it took a pound of powdered magnesium
 to photograph a midnight ball.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 While as early as 50 BCE, riotous soldiers leaving a Roman bath
 sliced through the ropes that hung the lamps from tree to tree
                                              and aloft us this
                                              new and larger room

Flambeaux the arboreal
                                             was the wife of Julius Caesar
                 in whose streets
                 in which a single step could be heard.
 We opened all our windows
 and looked out on a listening world laced here and there with points of light,
                                              Notre Dame of the Unfinished Sky,
 oil slicks burning on the river; someone down on the corner
 striking a match to read by. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Some claim Paris was the first modern city to light its streets.
         The inhabitants were ordered
         in 1524 to place a taper in every window in the dark there were 912 streets
                                 walked into this arc until by stars
                                 makes steps sharp, you are 
                  and are not alone
 by public decree
 October 1558: the lanterns were similar to those used in mines:
 “Once
 we were kings”
                                 and down into the spiral of our riches
 still reign: falots or great vases of pitch lit
 at the crossroads
                   —and thus were we followed 
                                                         through a city of thieves—which,
 but a few weeks later, were replaced by chandeliers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 While others claim all London was alight by 1414.
                                 There it was worded:
 Out of every window, come a wrist with a lanthorn
                                                                                                and were told          
                                                                                                hold it there
                                        and be on time
 and not before
 and watched below
 the faces lit, and watched the faces pass.         And turned back in
 (the face goes on) and watched the lights go out.
 Here the numbers are instructive:
                                In the early 18th century, London hung some 15,000 lamps.
 And now we find (1786) they’ve turned to crystal, placed precisely,
 each its own distance, small in islands, large in the time it would take to run.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




                                              And Venice started in 1687 with a bell
  
                                              upon the hearing of which, we all in unison
 exit,
 match in hand, and together strike them against an upper tooth and touch
 the tiny flame to anything, and when times get rough (crime up, etc.) all we
 have to do is throw oil out upon the canals to make the lighting uncommonly 
 extensive. Sometimes we do it just to shock the rest of Europe, and at other 
 times because we find it beautiful.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
 Says Libanius
                      Night differs us
                                           Without us
                                            noctes illustratas
                                                     Though in time of public grief
 when the streets were left unlit, on we went, just
 dark marks in the markets and voices in the cafes, in the crowded squares,
 a single touch, the living, a lantern
                                  swinging above the door any time a child is born, be it
 Antioch, Syria, or Edessa—
 and then there were the festivals,
                              the festum encaeniorum, and others in which
                              they call idolatrous, these torches
                                                                           half a city wide
                                                                                               be your houses.

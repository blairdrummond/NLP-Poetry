title : Thanksgiving Magic

Thanksgiving Day I like to see 
Our cook perform her witchery. 
She turns a pumpkin into pie 
As easily as you or I 
Can wave a hand or wink an eye. 
She takes leftover bread and muffin 
And changes them to turkey stuffin’. 
She changes cranberries to sauce 
And meats to stews and stews to broths; 
And when she mixes gingerbread 
It turns into a man instead 
With frosting collar ’round his throat 
And raisin buttons down his coat. 
Oh, some like magic made by wands, 
   And some read magic out of books, 
And some like fairy spells and charms 
   But I like magic made by cooks!

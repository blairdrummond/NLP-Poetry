Augustan

Act I, Scene xiii, Air XVI--"Over the Hills, and Far Away" 
Mac.    Were I laid on Greenland's coast,
               And in my arms embraced my lass,
          Warm amidst eternal frost,
               Too soon the half-year's night would pass.
Polly. Were I sold on Indian soil,
               Soon as the burning day was closed,
          I could mock the sultry toil
               When on my charmer's breast reposed.
Mac.    And I would love you all the day,
Polly. Every night would kiss and play,
Mac.    If with me you'd fondly stray
Polly. Over the hills, and far away.

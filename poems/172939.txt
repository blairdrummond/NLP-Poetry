title : Silent, Silent Night

author : William Blake

text : 
Silent Silent Night 
Quench the holy light 
Of thy torches bright 

For possessd of Day 
Thousand spirits stray 
That sweet joys betray 

Why should joys be sweet 
Used with deceit 
Nor with sorrows meet 

But an honest joy 
Does itself destroy 
For a harlot coy

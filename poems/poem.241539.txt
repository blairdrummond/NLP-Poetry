If I were a bear,
    And a big bear too,
 I shouldn't much care
    If it froze or snew;
 I shouldn't much mind
    If it snowed or friz--
 I'd be all fur-lined
    With a coat like his!
  
 For I'd have fur boots and a brown fur wrap,
 And brown fur knickers and a big fur cap.
 I'd have a fur muffle-ruff to cover my jaws,
 And brown fur mittens on my big brown paws.
 With a big brown furry-down up to my head,
 I'd sleep all the winter in a big fur bed.

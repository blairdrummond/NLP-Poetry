As if  anyone has the desire    . . .
Vickey trailed off, pouring another lager 

There'll be nothing left 
But fur and bone, as my lawyer once explained 

To my ex, she resumed, tapping a long cigarette 
On the bar. My, you're a bit snarky tonight 

Said Luther. Maybe you need a change of  venue, 
A beach with your breath on it 

Oh, she replied, nodding towards the far corner booth, 
These writers are so obnoxious 

I wish they'd find a new place to complain. 
Ha, said Hillary, they wouldn't know a good story 

If  it bit 'em in the butt. Plus, added Vickey 
There's always the lurking danger 

One may launch into a speech on human nature. 
I'll back that, said Rick (who, when animated 

Would lick his index finger and sweep it back and forth 
As if quickly turning pages of a catalog) 

They're just a bunch of spare parts clogging a garage. 
Hear, hear, exclaimed Hillary, let's give it to the boors 

And literary whores. 

How a bonfire magnifies everything. Or that early 
Skift of snow across brown meadows 

When you still haven't canned the peaches. 
Settle down Rick, said Luther, this isn't Chicago 

Indeed, Vickey countered, this town used to be known 
As Little  Jerusalem by certain parties in the old days 

All the churches. And hypocrite politicians, 
Added Luther. Well, it's all downhill from the north 

Where wanness began its mission, continued Rick, 
Waving his empty pint. Jesus, you can be a bore, said Vickey 

All heroes become bores eventually, instructed Hillary 

But did you know when Rick was born 
He looked like a little worm. His aunt told me — 

Luther, studying her profile, said 
I was a little worm too

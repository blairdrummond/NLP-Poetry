title : The Song of the Bow

author : Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle

text : 
What of the bow? 
    The bow was made in England: 
Of true wood, of yew-wood, 
    The wood of English bows; 
         So men who are free 
         Love the old yew-tree 
And the land where the yew-tree grows. 

What of the cord? 
    The cord was made in England: 
A rough cord, a tough cord, 
    A cord that bowmen love; 
         And so we will sing 
         Of the hempen string 
And the land where the cord was wove. 

What of the shaft? 
    The shaft was cut in England: 
A long shaft, a strong shaft, 
    Barbed and trim and true; 
         So we’ll drink all together 
         To the grey goose-feather 
And the land where the grey goose flew. 

What of the mark? 
    Ah, seek it not in England, 
A bold mark, our old mark 
    Is waiting over-sea. 
         When the strings harp in chorus, 
         And the lion flag is o’er us, 
It is there that our mark will be. 

What of the men? 
    The men were bred in England: 
The bowmen—the yeomen, 
    The lads of dale and fell. 
         Here’s to you—and to you! 
         To the hearts that are true 
And the land where the true hearts dwell.

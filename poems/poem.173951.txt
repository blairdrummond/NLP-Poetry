Rhymed Stanza

Ye living lamps, by whose dear light 
The nightingale does sit so late, 
And studying all the summer night, 
Her matchless songs does meditate; 

Ye country comets, that portend 
No war nor prince's funeral, 
Shining unto no higher end 
Than to presage the grass's fall; 

Ye glow-worms, whose officious flame 
To wand'ring mowers shows the way, 
That in the night have lost their aim, 
And after foolish fires do stray; 

Your courteous lights in vain you waste, 
Since Juliana here is come, 
For she my mind hath so displac'd 
That I shall never find my home.

Here's how we were counted:   
firstborn, nay-sayers, 
veterans, slow-payers, 
seditionists, convicts, 
half-breeds, has-beens, 
the nearly defined dead, 
all the disenfranchised live. 

Once everybody had a place   
among the nameless. Now we   
can't afford to be anonymous. 

Consider, they said, the poor,   
the misfit—consider the woman   
figuring herself per cent. 

Consider the P.A. system making   
a point so intimate I petition   
not to be anybody's good guess   
or estimate. I ask to be one: 

maybe widow-to-be watching the sun   
diminish brick by brick along the jail   
wall and also that green pear 
on its drunken roll out 
of the executioner's lunch basket. 
At 12:01, 02, in the cocked chamber   
of the digital clock 
the newsman said: There'll be less   
work in the new century. And my job 
will be, as usual, forgetting— 
or getting it backwards— 

each non-integer, tender and separate, 
fake rosebud, Rolodex, cab full of amputees 
obedient to traffic, moss on the baby's headstone . . . 

minus and minus' shock each minute,   
the kiss, its loss, 
each newborn and condemned-to-be   
in one breath executed, and blessed.

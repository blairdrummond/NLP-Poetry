title : To My Old City

author : W. S. Di Piero

You’re still there in the spectral impress,   
the plied afterimage grid of trucks 

and buses, diesel fume and bloodspoor streaked   
on wet streets, and cars biting evening papers 

from the black newsstand. Above, the trestle’s   
gravel bed hums expectantly, or with relief, 

and the gritty pinpoints of snow, at rest   
on silver rails, flare into the coming dark, 

while everywhere your hungry light still tries   
to reconstruct itself, charm the space 

in and around the looseknit ironworks,   
winter’s checkered yellowings glaring past 

the dark. From here, two years away, I see   
in your middle distance a trestle stretched 

between two brownstones, the whole scene   
droning deep: the train tears through the gap, 

ratcheting the space with green aquatic squares   
that flick past like old sluggish film, 

each frame a piece of failing, played-back fact,   
and the unseen wheels click, mumble, click 

in flukes of young clean snow fountaining up   
around those strangers abiding in the glass.

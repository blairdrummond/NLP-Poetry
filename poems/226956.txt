title : South Carolina Morning

Her red dress & hat   
   tease the sky’s level- 
 headed blue. Outside 

a country depot, 
   she could be a harlot   
 or saint on Sunday 

morning. We know   
   Hopper could slant   
 light till it falls 

on our faces. She waits   
   for a tall blues singer   
 whose twelve-string is 

hours out of hock, 
   for a pullman porter   
 with a pigskin wallet 

bulging with greenbacks,   
   who stepped out of Porgy 
 at intermission. This is 

paradise made of pigment   
   & tissue, where apples   
 ripen into rage & lust. 

In a quick glance,   
   beyond skincolor, 
 she’s his muse, his wife— 

the same curves 
   to her stance, the same   
 breasts beneath summer cloth.

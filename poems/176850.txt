title : The Jew

author : Isaac Rosenberg

text : 
Moses, from whose loins I sprung, 
Lit by a lamp in his blood 
Ten immutable rules, a moon 
For mutable lampless men. 

The blonde, the bronze, the ruddy, 
With the same heaving blood, 
Keep tide to the moon of Moses. 
Then why do they sneer at me?

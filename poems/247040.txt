title : The Last Hour

author : Christian Wiman

text : 
Lean and sane 
in the last hour 
of a long fast 
or fiercer discipline 
he could touch dust 
into a sudden 
surge of limbs 
and speak leaves 
in the night air 
above him, inhabit
 quiet so wholly 
he heard roots 
inch into the unfeeling 
earth, rings increasing 
inside of that tree.
Without moving, 
hardly breathing, 
he could call
 out of the long darkness 
walls around him, 
a house whose each room 
he knew, its hoard 
of silences, solitudes, 
doors opening 
onto the wide fields 
through which he moved, 
breathing deeply, 
unbewildered by the dead 
with their hands of wind, 
their faces of cloud. 
Stilled and gifted 
in the last hour 
before the first light,
in the dark place 
of his own making, 
he could feel rocks 
relax alive 
beside him, gather 
from a moon-raveled 
river the pearl 
curves and blue 
fluency of a girl 
his hands once knew.

He could let her go. 
He let it all go, 
desire and grief 
and raw need 
going out of him 
moment by moment 
into the mild 
immaculate night, 
love by love 
into a last 
passion of pure 
attention, nerves, 
readiness...

                     Light carved 
out of the darkness 
a muscled trunk, 
each clenched limb 
and the difficult tips 
of a plain mesquite 
taking shape 
over the hard ground 
where they found him, 
his eyes wide
and his whole body 
hungering upward, 
as if he could hear 
and bear the bird 
singing unseen 
deep in those leaves.

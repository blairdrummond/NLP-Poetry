title : The Whip

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
I spent a night turning in bed,
 my love was a feather, a flat
  
 sleeping thing. She was
 very white
  
 and quiet, and above us on
 the roof, there was another woman I
  
 also loved, had
 addressed myself to in
  
 a fit she
 returned. That
  
 encompasses it. But now I was
 lonely, I yelled,
  
 but what is that? Ugh,
 she said, beside me, she put 
  
 her hand on 
 my back, for which act
  
 I think to say this
 wrongly.

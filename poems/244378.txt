title : The President Flies Over

author : Patricia Smith

text : 
Aloft between heaven and them,
  
 I babble the landscape—what staunch, vicious trees,
 what cluttered roads, slow cars. This is my
  
 country as it was gifted me—victimless, vast.
 The soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears
 continually loops ditties of eagles and oil.
 I can’t choose. Every moment I’m awake,
 aroused instrumentals channel theme songs,
 speaking
 what I cannot.
  
 I don’t ever have to come down.
 I can stay hooked to heaven,
 dictating this blandness.
 My flyboys memorize flip and soar.
 They’ll never swoop real enough
 to resurrect that other country,
  
 won’t ever get close enough to give name
 to tonight’s dreams darkening the water.
  
 I understand that somewhere it has rained.

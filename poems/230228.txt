title : The Father of My Country

author : Diane Wakoski

text : 
All fathers in Western civilization must have   
a military origin. The 
ruler, 
governor, 
yes, 
he is 
was the 
general at one time or other. 
And George Washington 
won the hearts 
of his country—the rough military man   
with awkward 
sincere 
drawing-room manners. 

My father; 
have you ever heard me speak of him? I seldom 
do. But I had a father, 
and he had military origins—or my origins from 
him 
are military, 
militant. That is, I remember him only in uniform. But of the navy, 
30 years a chief petty officer, 
always away from home. 

It is rough/hard for me to speak   
now. 
I'm not used to talking 
about him. 
Not used to naming his objects/   
objects 
that never surrounded me. 

A woodpecker with fresh bloody crest   
knocks 
at my mouth. Father, for the first 
time I say 
your name. Name rolled in thick Polish parchment scrolls,   
name of Roman candle drippings when I sit at my table   
alone, each night, 
name of naval uniforms and name of 
telegrams, name of 
coming home from your aircraft carrier, 
name of shiny shoes. 
name of Hawaiian dolls, name 
of mess spoons, name of greasy machinery, and name of   
stencilled names. 
Is it your blood I carry in a test tube, 
my arm, 
to let fall, crack, and spill on the sidewalk 
in front of the men 
I know, 
I love, 
I know, and 
want? So you left my house when I was under two.   
being replaced by other machinery (my sister), and   
I didn’t believe you left me. 
                   This scene: the trunk yielding treasures of   
                   a green fountain pen, heart shaped mirror,   
                   amber beads, old letters with brown ink, and   
                   the gopher snake stretched across the palm tree 
                   in the front yard with woody trunk like monkey skins,   
                   and a sunset through the skinny persimmon trees. You   
                   came walking, not even a telegram or post card from   
                   Tahiti. Love, love, through my heart like ink in   
                   the thickest nibbed pen, black and flowing into words   
                   You came, to me, and I at least six. Six doilies   
                   of lace, six battleship cannon, six old beerbottles,   
                   six thick steaks, six love letters, six clocks   
                   running backwards, six watermelons, and six baby   
                   teeth, a six cornered hat on six men's heads, six   
                   lovers at once or one lover at sixes and sevens; 
                   how I confuse   
                   all this with my   
                   dream 
                   walking the tightrope bridge 
                   with gold knots   
                   over 
                   the mouth of an anemone/tissue spiral lips 
                   and holding on so that the ropes burned 
                   as if my wrists had been tied 

If George Washington 
had not 
been the Father 
of my Country 
it is doubtful that I would ever have 
found 
a father. Father in my mouth, on my lips, in my 
tongue, out of all my womanly fire, 
Father I have left in my steel filing cabinet as a name on my birth   
certificate, Father I have left in the teeth pulled out at   
dentists’ offices and thrown into their garbage cans, 
Father living in my wide cheekbones and short feet, 
Father in my Polish tantrums and my American speech, Father, not a 
holy name, not a name I cherish but the name I bear, the name   
that makes me one of a kind in any phone book because   
you changed it, and nobody 
but us 
has it, 
Father who makes me dream in the dead of night of the falling cherry 
blossoms, Father who makes me know all men will leave me   
if I love them, 
Father who made me a maverick, 
a writer, 
a namer, 
name/father, sun/father, moon/father, bloody mars/father, 
other children said, “My father is a doctor,” 
or 
“My father gave me this camera,” 
or 
“My father took me to 
the movies,” 
or 
“My father and I went swimming,” 
but 
my father is coming in a letter 
once a month 
for a while, 
and my father 
sometimes came in a telegram 
but 
mostly 
my father came to me 
in sleep, my father because I dreamed in one night that I dug   
through the ash heap in back of the pepper tree and found a diamond 
shaped like a dog, and my father called the dog and it came leaping 
over to him and he walked away out of the yard down the road with 
the dog jumping and yipping at his heels, 

my father was not in the telephone book 
in my city; 
my father was not sleeping with my mother 
at home; 
my father did not care if I studied the 
piano; 
my father did not care what 
I did; 
and I thought my father was handsome and I loved him and I wondered 
why 
he left me alone so much, 
so many years 
in fact, but 
my father made me what I am, 
a lonely woman, 
without a purpose, just as I was 
a lonely child 
without any father. I walked with words, words, and names,   
names. Father was not 
one of my words. 
Father was not 
one of my names. But now I say, “George, you have become my father, 
in his 20th century naval uniform. George Washington, I need your 
love; George, I want to call you Father, Father, my Father,”   
Father of my country, 
that is, 
me. And I say the name to chant it. To sing it. To lace it around   
me like weaving cloth. Like a happy child on that shining afternoon 
in the palmtree sunset with her mother’s trunk yielding treasures,   
I cry and 
cry, 
Father,   
Father,   
Father, 
have you really come home?

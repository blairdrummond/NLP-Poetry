title : Dolores Street

text : 
Through the Victorians 
spinning a wool of music 
the gang in the breeze 
Boys and girls headed toward the 
park 
No longer in my view 
Wondering now what they doing 
How they divide 
Hold hands 
Lay on benches 
Breathe 

Dolores park green waving 
mounds 
where downtown looks like you 
could stretch and scratch it 
You can see the water   
smaller the other side 
connected with the bay bridge 
from this angle 
Appears as a cowboy rope 
Lasso 

Back to the park 
the across the street is windows 
Suggest 
Eyes which could have been looking 
at savannahs / stretches 
had it not been for transportation 
The city settling 
Up from planks and kerosense lamps 
Rugged 

Small vocabularies full of passion 
Found a gold sliver on the way 
to my fruits 
Raise the air fair 
Let the news out 
Rush like Hawaiian beer 

The big radio of the teenagers 
comes again 
looking through the curtain 
Look them wasted 
Clothes wrinkled 
Eyes fresh like just arrived mushrooms 
they move to the interior of the Mission 
where they hang out / generations on the streets

title : After Peire Vidal, & Myself

author : Ted Berrigan

text : 
for Shelley
Oh you, the sprightliest & most puggish, the brightest star
 Of all my lively loves, all Ladies, & to whom once I gave up
 My heart entire, thenceforth yours to keep forever
 Locked up in your own heart’s tiniest room, my best hope, or
 To throw away, carelessly, at your leisure, should that prove
 Your best pleasure, Who is that dumpy matron, decked out in worn & 
         faded
 Shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before & behind, now
         screeching
 Scoring me painfully in philistine Commedia dell’arte farce, low
         summer fare
 Across a pedestrian Ferry’s stretch of water in some meshugganah Snug
         Harbor
 And once more, even, fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab Parish
         Hall of
 Manhattan’s Landmark Episcopal Church, where a once Avant-garde
         now Grade School
 Poetry Project continues to dwell, St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bouwerie,
         whose
 Stones hold in tight grip one wooden leg & all of Peter Stuyvesant’s
         bones?
 Who is that midget-witch who preens & prances as she flaunts her lost
         wares,
 Otherwise hidden beneath some ancient boy’s flannel-shirt, its tail out
 & flapping, & who
 Is shrieking even now these mean words:
                                                             “Hey     Ted!”     “Hey, you Fat God!”
 & called me, “Fickle!”         “Fickle!”
                                                                  & she points a long boney finger
 at me, & croons, gleefully.
                                                         “Limbo!”     “That's where you really live!”
 & She is claiming to be you
  
                                                 as she whispers, viciously,
                                                                                                             “Alone, &
 In Pain, In Limbo, is where you live     in your little cloud-9 home     Ted!
 Pitiful!”
                She has a small purse, & removing it from one of her
         shopping bags
 She brings out from inside that small purse, my withered heart; &
 lifting it
 high into the air over her head with her two hands, she turns it upside
         down
 unzips its fasteners, & shakes it out over the plywood floor, happily.
         “Empty,”
 she cries loudly, “just like I always knew it would be!” “Empty!”
         “Empty” “Empty”
  
 I watch her, and think,
                                      That’s not really you, up there, is it,
                 Rose?     Rochelle?     Shelley?
                                                                  O, don’t be sad, little Rose! It’s still
 Your ribbon I wear, your favor tied to the grip of my lance, when I
         ride out to give battle,
                                                   these golden days.

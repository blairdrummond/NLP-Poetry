from Maud: O that 'twere possible 
Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Victorian
England
Love, Heartache & Loss



O that 'twere possible
After long grief and pain
To find the arms of my true love
Round me once again!...

A shadow flits before me,
Not thou, but like to thee:
Ah, Christ! that it were possible
For one short hour to see
The souls we loved, that they might tell us
What and where they be!

title : What I Would Give

What I would like to give them for a change
 is not the usual prescription with
 its hubris of the power to restore,
 to cure; what I would like to give them, ill 
 from not enough of laying in the sun
 not caring what the onlookers might think
 while feeding some banana to their dogs—
 what I would like to offer them is this,
 not reassurance that their lungs sound fine,
 or that the mole they’ve noticed change is not
 a melanoma, but instead of fear
 transfigured by some doctorly advice
 I’d like to give them my astonishment
 at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping, 
 and how ridiculously gently it
 slicked down my hair; I’d like to give them that,
 the joy I felt while staring in your eyes
 as you learned epidemiology
 (the science of disease in populations),
 the night around our bed like timelessness,
 like comfort, like what I would give to them.

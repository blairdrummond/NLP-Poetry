title : Nietzsche’s Hands

author : Christopher Middleton

text : 
Celebrated, the moustache, 
And near enough ignored 
His “beautiful hands”. 

Capable on a keyboard, improvised 
A polonaise, his own artistic 
Compositions “dull and decent”. 

He could see, some, but much swam, out there: 
Knives and forks, print, street signs. 
Then, his mind made up, he laid about, 

Sank immense nets into the cultural acid. 
When we winched them back in, on fingertips, 
They rippled with rainbows—herring and sprat 

He could fling, raw, in the teeth 
Of the Bürgertum, God rot it. Ah, no God: 
So to invoke the impact of quanta on quanta 

And extirpate for keeps the German cabbage, 
His fingers, subject to whim, and rounded 
Like objects in a metephor, made good the feeble 

Peering eyes. Each tip housed a labyrinth, 
Circling in or out, from ivories an octopod 
Pressed the torrent of a tune. From Cretan pots 

Their gestures, snaking out, apprehended, 
Turn on turn, a tumbril in the stars. 
Those fingers must have held, no less, the comb 

To bush his hairy icon out, to primp. 
On long mountain walks they jotted Gothic 
Letters on a page, deleted angrily 

Brainwaves, on a page one trouser leg 
Segregated from his knee. What a joy, 
At long last, to know the knower not deceived 

But disobedient, at his word. Underneath 
The creams of language here’s a tongue can taste 
A universe, cyclopic, but propulsive, alien 

To a species blocked by self-torment, 
To shopping, authority—all the cockahoop 
Engines of flesh not fuelled by despair. 

When Nietzche, squinting, trimmed his fingernails, 
Did he care for suchlike slighter things? 
To a turning pot a potter’s fingers do not cling.

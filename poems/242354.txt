title : Book 2, Epigram 22

author : Thomas Bastard

text : 
I met a courtier riding on the plain,
 Well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed;
 I sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain 
 My lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed:
 He saw my case, and then of courtesy
 Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in,
 Because I did desire his company:
 But he corvetting way of me did win. 
      What should I do, who was besteaded so?
       His horse stood still faster than mine could go.

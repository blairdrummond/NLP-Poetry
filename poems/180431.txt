Happiness. I am not used 
to this. (There is always 
something wrong.) 
Look at it 
the bright early tree. 
(I am trying to find out 
how you fell.) 
The leaves have already turned. 
(I want you to see 
this, how they 
glow outside the glass.) 
Morning light strikes 
differently. For so 
many years I hardly 
had time to know such 
moments. They struck me 
with such intensity 
I would have said 
battered me open. 
I never understood 
they were mine. 
I was panicked. 
Unhappiness caught up with me 
all the time. 
Did you know 
the speed of light never alters 
even when you go faster 
it will be 
still that much faster 
than you? 
(I am thinking that in your fall 
something momentous occurred.) 
What I see as beautiful 
I want you to see too. 
Next door, the workmen are hammering. 
Very soon we’ll go to lunch. 
For some reason this moves me to tears. 
How life is. 
(One does not have to explain 
what occurs. One only need say 
it has meaning.) 
Years ago, when I was young 
I traveled to Italy, took in 
the great sights. I was in awe, yet 
I did not understand 
seeing Masaccio’s frescoes 
fading like shadows into the walls, 
this would be the only time 
nor that 
I would never forget. 
Those muted shades are 
still with me, as possession 
and longing, and the view too 
of the square before that church 
the air, newly spring, 
that day, all of it. 
Life, I have finally begun to realize, 
is real. 
(All this time you recover 
from falling 
will sink indelibly into mind.) 
The leaves 
may fall before you are able 
to see them. Science 
has recently learned 
the line 
of existence is soft 
and stretches out like a field 
wind and light shaping the grass 
energy 
of sight giving consciousness 
force. In the meantime 
we live out our lives. 
(This morning we talked for so long 
everything became lucid. 
How can I say what I see?) 
At each turning 
perfection eludes me. 
One moment is not like another. 
Last spring 
the house next door caught fire. 
There was the smell of gas. 
We thought 
both houses would go. 
I vanished up the hill, 
went to the house of a friend 
where we listened for flames 
and to that aria from Italian 
opera, was it the one of love, 
or jealousy, or grief? 
My house was untouched. 
Now the one next door is painted, 
fixed. In place of 
perfection, the empty hands 
I turned out to the world 
are filled. 
With what? A letter 
half written, the notes 
I make on this page, 
this new feeling about my shoulders 
of age, that sad child’s story 
you told me this morning, 
the workmen’s tools sounding 
and stopping. What? As time 
moves through me, does it also 
move through you? 
I keep remembering what you said, 
ways you have of seeing (and that 
light must have curved with 
you fall.) This 
is the paradox of vision: 
Sharp perception softens 
our existence in the world.

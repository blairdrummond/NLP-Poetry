title : Now I'm a Woman

When you hear the knives ring
 Turn the page.
 I wonder why I am not
 Myself of late, ridiculous glass edges
 Turn back on themselves
 And soon reveal
 The hand of an apprentice
 And godforsaken embarrassing torch,
 Stormy back hallways
 Out of the black and wooden theatres.
 Crystal Waters plus her driver
 Plus her entourage is still rolling out
 Of the Sands, Atlantic City
 On the soundtracks to shows
 Held over at The Fairmount
 She is throwing back shots
 With the mafia. I have learned
 To take apart this American Songbook
 And very fortunately as I would take
 My audience in confidence
 Threads of gold fall closely together
 Coming to break us off.
 At the first of the shows
 I sang this song
 And in between I saw him in the hall,
 What could I tell you?
 “Someday we’ll build on a hilltop high.”

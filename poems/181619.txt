title : Daddy: 1933

author : Geoffrey Brock

text : 
If one takes   
a walk on a clear sunny   
day in middle April, 

when the first   
willows are in bloom,   
one may often see   

young bumblebee queens   
eagerly sipping 
nectar from the catkins— 

thus begins 
the one book written 
by Otto Emil Plath. 

It is a delightful thing 
to pause and watch 
these queens, clad 

in their costumes of rich   
velvet, their wings 
not yet torn— 

he wrote it the year after   
Sylvia was born— 
by the long foraging 

flights which   
they will be obliged   
to take later.

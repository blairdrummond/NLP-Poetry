title : False Portrait of D.B. as Niccolò Paganini

author : Michael Palmer

Those who have lived here since before 
time are gone while the ones who must 
replace them have not yet arrived. 

The streets are wet with a recent 
rain yet you continue to count 
first minutes and hours then trees 

rocks, windows, mailboxes, streetlights 
and pictographs refusing to 
rest even for the brief span it 

would take to dry off, change clothes and 
reemerge grotesque yet oddly 
attractive like Paganini 

whose mother was visited by 
a seraph in Genoa not 
long before his birth and who is 

thought now to have acquired much of 
his technical wizardry as 
a result of Marfan’s syndrome 

a quite common anomaly 
of the connective tissues which 
may well account for the tall and 

angular body, muscular 
underdevelopment as well 
as the hypermobile joints that 

eventuated on the stage 
in a peculiar stance, a 
spectacular bowing technique 

and an awesome mastery of 
the fingerboard. He would bring his 
left hip forward to support his 

body’s weight. His left shoulder, thrust 
forward also, would enable 
him to rest his left elbow on 

his chest, a buttress against the 
stress of forceful bowing along 
with debilitating muscle 

fatigue. The looseness of the right 
wrist and shoulder gave pliancy 
leading to broad acrobatic 

bowing. The ‘spider’ fingers of 
his left hand permitted a range 
on the fingerboard which many 

attributed to black magic 
for Paganini was said to 
have signed a pact with Lucifer 

to acquire virtuosity 
as a small child. After his death 
perhaps due in part to this tale 

in part also to rumours of 
gambling and wild debauchery 
the Church refused to allow him 

burial on hallowed ground. In   
consequence his body was moved 
furtively from place to place 

until after many years and 
for reasons still mysterious 
the Church finally relented. 

A few paradoxes should be 
noted as an afterward. Though 
accused of charlatanism he 

was rewarded for his skill like 
no one before him. He loved his 
violin above all yet once 

he gambled it away at cards.   
He accepted wealth and renown 
from his worshipping admirers 

but tripled the admission price 
to his concerts in the face of 
adverse reviews. While openly 

irreverent of tradition 
he still took a princess as his lover 
and let nations strike medals in his name.

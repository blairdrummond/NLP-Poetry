has its little hobbies. The lung 
likes its air best after supper, 
goes deeper there to trade up 
for oxygen, give everything else 
away. (And before supper, yes, 
during too, but there’s 
something about evening, that 
slow breath of the day noticed: oh good, 
still coming, still going ... ) As for 
bones—femur, spine, 
the tribe of them in there—they harden 
with use. The body would like 
a small mile or two. Thank you. 
It would like it on a bike 
or a run. Or in the water. Blue. 
And food. A habit that involves 
a larger circumference where a garden’s 
involved, beer is brewed, cows 
wake the farmer with their fullness, 
a field surrenders its wheat, and wheat 
understands I will be crushed  
into flour and starry-dust  
the whole room, the baker 
sweating, opening a window 
to acknowledge such remarkable 
confetti. And the brain, 
locked in its strange 
dual citizenship, idles there in the body, 
neatly terraced and landscaped. 
Or left to ruin, such a brain, 
wild roses growing 
next to the sea. The body is 
gracious about that. Oh, their 
scent sometimes. Their 
tangle. In truth, in secret, 
the first thing 
in morning the eye longs to see.

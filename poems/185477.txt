title : Insanity

author : Calvin Thomas Jr.

text : 
The quick-sliding cape of mind 
Drags wrinkled on a dusty floor, 
A party dress, 
Sagging from those shoulders 
      of a smile 
      that stalks through crooked time 
             followed by a goat 
             nipping the petticoat. 
Scape-goat, grin out loud. 
Make the cloak a shroud. 
      He whinnys through the nose, 
             paws the trailing hem 
             and strikes a fawning pose. 

Tight-clamped, the clasp of tin 
Tears cloth it won’t undo. 
Before the gown slips down. 
A rent . . . which lets the darkness through.

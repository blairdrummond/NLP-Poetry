title : Against Conceit

author : Roddy Lumsden

text : 
Don't say Sir Pigeon in his cobalt bonnet. 
Don't find among your notes 
jottings on duvets and blizzards and the page   

unwalked across               black missives of girlhood 
must be sent off and do not claim the furnace   
of the universe is powered by human screams. 

When the dark turns dark 
or when the bullet lifts a scalp, 
it is enough to know the lover feels the slap 

that the world can hear the sharp shout   
               which wakes the cat 
her claws one inch from the rabbit's bobbing scut.

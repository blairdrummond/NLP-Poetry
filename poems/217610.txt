title : Beside the Broad Dordogne

I wake to the sound of water, and think, 
"Mother has died and gone to France," 
She is at un autre hôtel, speaking French 
better than ever, while I stare at the fog 
that has a river in it—the broad Dordogne, 
making its river noise, as if all the faucets 
have been left on all night. The river 
rushing in one direction only, so different 
from Blackfish Creek, where the sea floods in 
and back, scrubbing the sand both ways. 

Well, one travels so things are different. 
American actors speak French on TV here. 
Last night they showed Accident Catastrophe 
about two babies switched in the hospital at birth. 
One dies. The parents discover the dead child 
was someone else's and their child is alive 
in Florida with son père, though sa mère 
est morte de some disease, who knows? 

Anyway, Ed Asner, who plays the lawyer, 
speaks gravelly French, but people have 
an American demeanor, they pull their hair 
on the edge of violence. Then each family 
gives up a piece, and the child ends up more 
loved than ever, as if it's inevitable. 
Or so the river is telling me 
with its one-way simplicity, 
like gravity. "Alive in the eternal 
heart of France"—that's Mother 
I'm thinking about, for some reason, 

maybe the journal my wife's been keeping, 
so like the daily letters Mother wrote 
to sa mère et son père, when her life 
was flowing through her like the broad 
Dordogne. And where is she now? 
Does she wish my father were with her, 
one of him alive, and one with her? 
A bell is ringing wildly, each of its peals 
like a round boat rolling downstream 
where the river divides around an island 
only to sweep back into itself 
somewhere in the fog.

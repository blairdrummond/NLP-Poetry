title : Protector #2 Your Personal Amulet

author : Laynie Browne

text : 
This sonnet is your personal amulet
 To be worn in instance of need
 Or constantly held in the mind
 Occurring here and elsewhere at this moment
 This sonnet is sent without cunning
 To cull a particular phrase from your lips
 To enlist another protector
 In this age of malcontent benefactors
 Against an ironclad schooner
 Feudal kingdom
 Dismemberment by jubilant crowds
 Strangely indifferent faces
 Heat and dust besides
 Suicide implicating others

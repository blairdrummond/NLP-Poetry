I was asleep while you were dying.
 It’s as if you slipped through some rift, a hollow
 I make between my slumber and my waking,
  
 the Erebus I keep you in, still trying
 not to let go. You’ll be dead again tomorrow,
 but in dreams you live. So I try taking
  
 you back into morning. Sleep-heavy, turning,
 my eyes open, I find you do not follow.
 Again and again, this constant forsaking.

 Again and again, this constant forsaking:
 my eyes open, I find you do not follow.
 You back into morning, sleep-heavy, turning.
  
 But in dreams you live. So I try taking,
 not to let go. You’ll be dead again tomorrow.
 The Erebus I keep you in—still, trying—
  
 I make between my slumber and my waking.
 It’s as if you slipped through some rift, a hollow.
 I was asleep while you were dying.

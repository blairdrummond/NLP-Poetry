title : Light the Festive Candles

(FOR HANUKKAH)
Light the first of eight tonight— 
the farthest candle to the right. 

Light the first and second, too, 
when tomorrow's day is through. 

Then light three, and then light four— 
every dusk one candle more 

Till all eight burn bright and high, 
honoring a day gone by 

When the Temple was restored, 
rescued from the Syrian lord, 

And an eight-day feast proclaimed— 
The Festival of Lights—well named 

To celebrate the joyous day 
when we regained the right to pray 
to our one God in our own way.

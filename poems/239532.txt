Turning to 
 weightless
 implements
 of gear-click
 hedging in
  
               instamatic
  
               blue, our ticking
               gaze
               in light 
               like waves,
               overturning
  
 A lifeline,
 a forerunning wake of life
 rafts and instruments,
 luminal seconds
 in cesium
 skimmed threshold
 or eleventh hour
  
              draped
              across
              the doorjamb.
  
 We lack fear of flatness
 or our impalement
 on axes, blinking
 a reticle of stasis:
 turn it over and begin
 again, this dripping
 like TV test patterns.
  
 Let’s stay, I say,
 and buoy ourselves
 in river locks
 intercalated
 in channels
 or our fender-bent
 synapses, recycling
  
 this floating.
  
 Never believing in water torture or autisms as misfortune,
 we were counting gold in a pointillistic landscape of radiating
 boulevards. In Budapest, a necropolis of shifting foci grid-dots.
 Soviet heroes, missing limbs.
  
 The thought does not sadden us,
 but the calculation
 of sundials:
 whether flat or equatorial
  
 they always deliver
  
 this sublimating ice
  
 (we are tapping on the ceiling)

title : The Bat

author : Ellen Bryant Voigt

text : 
Reading in bed, full of sentiment 
for the mild evening and the children   
asleep in adjacent rooms, hearing them   
cry out now and then the brief reports   
of sufficient imagination, and listening   
at the same time compassionately   
to the scrabble of claws, the fast treble   
in the chimney— 
                      then it was out, 
not a trapped bird 
beating at the seams of the ceiling, 
but a bat lifting toward us, falling away. 

Dominion over every living thing, 
large brain, a choice of weapons— 
Shuddering, in the lit hall 
we swung repeatedly against 
its rising secular face 
until it fell; then 
shoveled it into the yard for the cat   
who shuttles easily between two worlds.

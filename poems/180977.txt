text : 
The last snow is baited. 
Where the future shatters 
it unbends. 
The dry bed of entirety, 
where the sun bends, 
shatters. 

I was not afraid to tell you: 
unobscene 
at the first and then 
the third horizon, 
a copse-mountain 
opened so near to me 
I weighed nothing, 
and you laid the flower in my mouth. 

These are not animals. 
These are the partial genocides 
deeply uncompensated. 
Under the grass 
there is nothing but water 
and two wings.

After our march from the Hudson to the top 
of Cemetery Hill, we Boy Scouts proudly endured 
the sermons and hot sun while Girl Scouts 
lolled among graves in the maple shade. 
When members of the veterans’ honor guard 
aimed their bone-white rifles skyward and fired, 
I glimpsed beneath one metal helmet 
the salmon-pink flesh of Mr. Webber’s nose, 
restored after shrapnel tore it.

Friends who sat near me in school died in Asia, 
now lie here under new stones that small flags flap 
beside. 
          It’s fifth-grade recess: war stories. 
Mr. Webber stands before us and plucks 
his glass eye from its socket, holds it high 
between finger and thumb. The girls giggle 
and scream; the awed boys gape. The fancy pocket watch 
he looted from a shop in Germany 
ticks on its chain.

title : [Often when he was advancing]

author : [Often when he was advancing] Charles Juliet

text : 
often 
when he was advancing 
feeling his way in the night 
he was doubtful      rebelled 
wanted to climb back up 
to the old light 

but a force held him 
enjoined him 
to pursue 
to venture 
once more 
once again 
into the thickest darkness 
of his shadow 

one day 
at the height of his distress 
emptied of all force 
driven to see that 
the inaccessible would not yield 
he admitted that he must 
renounce it 

to his great surprise 
without his having 
to take a single step 
he crossed the threshold 
came into the light

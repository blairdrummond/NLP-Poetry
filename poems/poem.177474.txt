Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals

Rhymed Stanza

A host of poppies, a flight of swallows;   
A flurry of rain, and a wind that follows   
Shepherds the leaves in the sheltered hollows 
   For the forest is shaken and thinned. 

Over my head are the firs for rafter; 
The crows blow south, and my heart goes after; 
I kiss my hands to the world with laughter-- 
   Is it Aidenn or mystical Ind? 

Oh, the whirl of the fields in the windy weather! 
How the barley breaks and blows together!   
Oh, glad is the free bird afloat on the heather-- 
   Oh, the whole world is glad of the wind!

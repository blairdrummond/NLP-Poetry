John F. Kennedy
        New York City
            I saw him across the lobby
                 flight 161
                     St. Louis
                         Albuquerque.
Coyote looked in control
        cool 
             fitting right into the city
                 smiling when a pretty woman passed him
                     figuring out his flight
                          making calculations from behind
                              the New York Times.
Slick
         right down to his Tony Lamas
             Coyote
                 I’d recognize him anywhere
                     Copenhagen
                          New York
                              Gallup.
People say
you can dress ’em up
        but once a coyote
             always a coyote.

title : Approximately Forever

author : C. D. Wright

text : 
She was changing on the inside
it was true what had been written

The new syntax of love 
both sucked and burned

The secret clung around them 
She took in the smell

Walking down a road to nowhere 
every sound was relevant

The sun fell behind them now 
he seemed strangely moved

She would take her clothes off 
for the camera

she said in plain english
but she wasnâ€™t holding that snake

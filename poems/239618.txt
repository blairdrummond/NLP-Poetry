title : God is President, She’s the Rose of the World

When it’s that time of month
 it’s like falling backwards in “time.”
  
 God has abandoned her glass carriage,
 she is “dead.”
  
 And the edges of objects: wavy
 in the eye that’s about to cry,
  
 a twitter running down the spine of…
 Oh God, it can’t be. (Insert song of mourning.)
  
 God and time, spine of the world — yawn, blah, blah, schma…
 what I meant to say is
  
 it’s hard to be a capitalist.
  
 If the world’s time is God, and she’s birds
 atwitter, then why must I go to work?
 The answer writes itself:
  
 left to my own devices I’d just sink into the soil.
 That is, write, with dirt
  
 as my pillow.   In the hole between twitters
  
 there’s random patches
 of mud-sky. So humid.
  
 There’re chairs growing in hell.
  
 There’re chairs growing in hell,
 and people sit on them, my co-workers:
 it’s like riding on toadstools
 except you don’t know it, or
 you kind of know it that time of
  
 month.
 That’s when you feel the twitter, the muddy shiver.
  
 You dream of your uncle turning a lamb on a spit
 high on a green cliff, with fog thickening around him
  
 and then he’s made to swallow keys and little hammers—
  
 you claw the red clay.
 Now wake.
 Show me the bouquet!
  
 No, don’t show me the bouquet.
  
 Show me the bouquet!
 If you do, I won’t tell on you
  
 to the rose of the world. She can make him hear you up there.
 Besides, it’s not a cliff, it’s a chair.
  
 And the rose is God.
 Got it?
 Gott it?
  
 This is why women should be President.

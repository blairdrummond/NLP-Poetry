I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South, 
No wraith, but utterly--as still more alone 
The Southern Cross takes night
And lifts her girdles from her, one by one--
High, cool,
               wide from the slowly smoldering fire 
Of lower heavens,--       
                         vaporous scars!

Eve! Magdalene!
                        or Mary, you?

Whatever call--falls vainly on the wave. 
O simian Venus, homeless Eve,
Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve 
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever; 
Finally to answer all within one grave!

And this long wake of phosphor,
                                          iridescent
Furrow of all our travel--trailed derision! 
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell 
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision
The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.

I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross 
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically. 
It is blood to remember; it is fire
To stammer back . . . It is
God--your namelessness. And the wash--         

All night the water combed you with black 
Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished. 
Water rattled that stinging coil, your
Rehearsed hair--docile, alas, from many arms. 
Yes, Eve--wraith of my unloved seed!

The Cross, a phantom, buckled--dropped below the dawn. 
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.

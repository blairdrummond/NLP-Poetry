jumpsuits, they have changed
            painting, I
behind the concertina wire
can't look at it anymore, that wall
across which shadows play
Sorry to be vague
            at such an hour. Were you
When I called, I heard
            my voice

anywhere near waking
            in the background
Strange, reversible lines, I thought
he was dead. He is
better of it, pushing the glass
away. How many songs
            can it hold, that thing
I've seen in windows, has it changed
            singing, or

hooded figures
            I didn't know
it had a camera, some features are
The blue of links, obscure
beneath the face, the green
We still don't have a word for
            Simulated drowning in
embedded streams
            a perfect world

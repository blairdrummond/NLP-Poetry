I like to find   
what's not found   
at once, but lies 

within something of another nature,   
in repose, distinct.   
Gull feathers of glass, hidden 

in white pulp: the bones of squid   
which I pull out and lay 
blade by blade on the draining board— 

       tapered as if for swiftness, to pierce   
       the heart, but fragile, substance 
       belying design.               Or a fruit, mamey, 

cased in rough brown peel, the flesh   
rose-amber, and the seed: 
the seed a stone of wood, carved and 

polished, walnut-colored, formed   
like a brazilnut, but large, 
large enough to fill 
the hungry palm of a hand. 

I like the juicy stem of grass that grows 
within the coarser leaf folded round, 
and the butteryellow glow 
in the narrow flute from which the morning-glory   
opens blue and cool on a hot morning.

title : Hello, Willie Shoemaker

author : Charles Bukowski

text : 
the Chinaman said don’t take the hardware 
and gave me a steak I couldn’t cut (except the fat) 
and there was an ant circling the coffee cup; 
I left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer, 
and outside I gave an old bum who looked about 
the way I felt, I gave him a quarter, 
and then I went up to see the old man 
strong as steel girders, fit for bombers and blondes, 
up the green rotten steps that housed rats 
and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing 
and the old man sat there looking at me 
through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in Paris, 
and he said, Kid, I hear you been takin’ Marylou out, 
and I said, just to dinner, boss, 
and he said, just to dinner, eh? you couldn’t hold 
that broad’s pants on with all the rivets on 5th street, 
and please remember you are a shipping clerk, 
I am the boss here and I pay these broads and I pay you. 
yes, sir, I said, and I felt he was going to skip it 
but he slid my last check across the desk 
and I took it and walked out 
past 
all the lovely legs, the skirts pulled up to the ass, 
Marylou’s ass, Ann’s ass, Vicki’s ass, all of them, 
and I went down to the bar 
and George said whatya gonna do now, 
and I said go to Russia or Hollywood Park, 
and I looked up in time to see Marylou come in, 
the long thin nose, the delicate face, the lips, the legs, 
the breasts, the music, the talk the love the laughing 
and she said 
I quit when I found out 
and the bastard got down on his knees and cried 
and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money 
and I 
walked out 
and he blubbered like a baby. 
George, I said, another drink, and I put a quarter in 
the juke 
and the sun came out 
and I looked outside in time to see the old bum 
with my quarter 
and a little more luck 
that had turned into a happy wine-bottle, 
and a bird even flew by cheep cheep, 
right there on Eastside downtown, no kidding, 
and the Chinaman came in for a quickie 
claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup 
and I leaned over and bit Marylou on the ear 
and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom 
and I decided that Russia was too far away 
and Hollywood Park just close enough.

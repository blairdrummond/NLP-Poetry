title : Elegance

text : 
All that is uncared for. 
Left alone in the stillness 
in that pure silence married 
to the stillness of nature. 
A door off its hinges, 
shade and shadows in an empty room. 
Leaks for light. Raw where 
the tin roof rusted through. 
The rustle of weeds in their 
different kinds of air in the mornings, 
year after year. 
A pecan tree, and the house 
made out of mud bricks. Accurate 
and unexpected beauty, rattling 
and singing. If not to the sun, 
then to nothing and to no one.

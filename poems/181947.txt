title : Longing for Prophets

author : Shirley Kaufman

text : 
Not for their ice-pick eyes, 
their weeping willow hair, 
and their clenched fists beating at heaven. 
Not for their warnings, predictions 
of doom. But what they promised. 
I don’t care if their beards 
are mildewed, and the ladders 
are broken. Let them go on 
picking the wormy fruit. Let the one 
with the yoke around his neck 
climb out of the cistern. 
Let them come down from the heights 
in their radiant despair 
like the Sankei Juko dancers descending 
on ropes, down from these hills 
to the earth of their first existence. 
Let them follow the track 
we’ve cut on the sides of mountains 
into the desert, and stumble again 
through the great rift, littered 
with bones and the walls of cities. 
Let them sift through the ashes 
with their burned hands. Let them 
tell us what will come after.

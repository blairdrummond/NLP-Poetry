title : from The Fatalist: Come October, it's the lake not the border

Come October, it’s the lake not the border 
that has been redrawn. Thinking 
about the event afterwards, I realize how remarkably well-prepared   
the girls are. There don’t seem to be any slouches 
among them. Please tell them I say hello and that we’ll need 14   
for the green salad and 14 for the apple tarts between 
with some rapid washing in clear water I remember as play 
and planning in childhood, preparing until the very last moment   
for a gripping narrative that was itself perpetually given over 
to improvisations and asymmetrical collaborations that could run 
for days. That makes another 14. It was ”the word“ or “the world” in 1981   
when we undertook to talk about the phrase 
“once in a while” once in a while 
noting the vagueness then named “a while” and how “once” the phrase   
recurs and therefore means more than once 
the “while” is defined. We too are in “a while”   
and when “once” next occurs, if the basic design suits 
you, we will need a bit of modestly biographical contextualization   
for November. I’m going to put some thought to something 
implausibly contemporary which perhaps isn’t wise 
since between then and now no new coincidences have been noted   
just one large color photograph of bespangled cowgirls 
herding heavy bulls up the avenue that opens this week carefully   
wearing baby blue boots to take out the garbage 
but it never rained. At the end of the month, Halloween should be clear.

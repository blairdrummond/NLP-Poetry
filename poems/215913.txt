title : The Odd Last Thing She Did

author : Brad Leithauser

text : 
A car is idling on the cliff. 
Its top is down. Its headlights throw 
A faint, bright ghost-shadow glow 
On the pale air. On the shore, so far 
Below that the waves' push and drag 
Is dwindled to a hush—a kind 
Of oceanic idle—the sea 
Among the boulders plays a blind- 
Fold game of hide and seek, 
Or capture the flag. The flag 
Swells and sways. The car 
Is empty. A Friday, the first week 
Of June. Nineteen fifty-three. 

A car's idling on the cliff, 
But surely it won't be long before 
Somebody stops to investigate 
And things begin to happen fast: 
Men, troops of men will come, 
Arrive with blazing lights, a blast 
Of sirens, followed by still more 
Men. Though not a soul's in sight, 
The peace of the end of the late 
Afternoon—the sun down, but enough light 
Even so to bathe the heavens from 
Horizon to shore in a deep 
And delicate blue—will not keep. 

Confronted with such an overload 
Of questions (most beginning, Why would she... 
So gifted, bright, and only twenty-three), 
Attention will come to fix upon 
This odd last thing she did: leaving 
The car running, the headlights on. 
She stopped—it will transpire—to fill 
The tank a mere two miles down the road. 
(Just sixteen, the kid at the station will 
Quote her as saying, "What a pity 
You have to work today! It's not right... 
What weather! Goodness, what a night 
It'll be!" He'll add: "She sure was pretty.") 

Was there a change of plan? 
Why the stop for gas? Possibly 
She'd not yet made up her mind? Or 
Had made it up but not yet settled 
On a place? Or could it be she knew 
Where she was headed, what she would do— 
And wanted to make sure the car ran 
For hours afterward? Might the car not be, 
Then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- 
In-reverse, meant to direct one not 
Away from but toward the shore 
And its broken boulders, there to spot 
The bobbing white flag of a blouse? 

Her brief note, which will appear 
In the local Leader, contains a phrase 
("She chanted snatches of old lands") 
That will muddle the town for three days, 
Until a Professor E. H. Wade 
Pins it to Ophelia—and reprimands 
The police, who, this but goes to show, 
Have not the barest knowledge of Shakespeare, 
Else would never have misread "lauds" 
As "lands." A Detective Gregg Messing 
Will answer, tersely, "Afraid 
It's not our bailiwick. Missing 
Persons, yes; missing poems, no." 

(What's truly tragic's never allowed 
To stand alone for long, of course. 
At each moment there's a crowd 
Of clowns pressing in: the booming ass 
At every wake who, angling a loud 
Necktie in the chip dip, 
Airs his problems with intestinal gas, 
Or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell 
Siding to the grieving mother . . . . Well, 
Wade sent the Leader another briefword: 
"Decades of service to the Bard now force 
Me to amend the girl's little slip. 
'Chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . .") 

Yet none of her unshakeable entourage 
—Pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, 
And a yearning young grease-monkey—are 
Alerted yet. Still the empty car 
Idles, idles on the cliff, and night 
Isn't falling so much as day 
Is floating out to sea . . . . Soon, whether 
She's found or not, her lights will draw 
Moths and tiny dark-winged things that might 
Be dirt-clumps, ashes. Come what may, 
The night will be lovely, as she foresaw, 
The first stars easing through the blue, 
Engine and ocean breathing together.

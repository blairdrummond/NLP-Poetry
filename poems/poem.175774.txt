Why am I if I am uncertain reasons may inclose.   
Remain remain propose repose chose.   
I call carelessly that the door is open   
Which if they may refuse to open   
No one can rush to close.   
Let them be mine therefor.   
Everybody knows that I chose.   
Therefor if therefore before I close.   
I will therefore offer therefore I offer this. 
Which if I refuse to miss may be miss is mine. 
I will be well welcome when I come.   
Because I am coming. 
Certainly I come having come.

At dusk, the grandmother sits alone 
in the light of the long pale pool and speaks 
to the frog who is waiting 
by the electric gate of the clubhouse. 

It will be all right, she says, leaning out 
from her chair. Her voice 

is churning, and old, and wet 
with advice. Her newly red hair 
purples under the bug light. It will be 
all right, she says, again, and again 

the sky rolls in and out on its journey 
across the peninsula, rattling the palms.

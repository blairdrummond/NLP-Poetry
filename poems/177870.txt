title : Playroom

author : Mary Barnard

text : 
Wheel of sorrow, centerless. 
Voices, sad without cause, 
slope upward, expiring on grave summits.   
Mournfulness of muddy playgrounds,   
raw smell of rubbers and wrapped lunches   
when little girls stand in a circle singing   
of windows and of lovers. 

Hearing them, no one could tell 
why they sing sadly, but there is in their voices   
the pathos of all handed-down garments   
hanging loosely on small bodies.

title : Elsewhere, Mon Amour

author : Nick Flynn

text : 
Leaning from the platform, waiting for a glimmer 
to braid the rails 

the eyes of the action hero cut from the poster 

all that concrete pressing down 

A fine edge gleams around your body 
as if it could be contained 

The way each finger is licked, dipped in & 
rubbed across the gums 

until the teeth go away 
Even my hands kiss you 

A night broken down into grains 

If you find yourself lost, dig 

a cave in the snow, quickly 
you need shelter against the night 

A candle could keep you alive 
the engine of your lungs 

will heat the air around you, someone will 
miss you, they will send out dogs 

You must be somewhere, right?

Dear Letters, Fond Letters, 
       Must I with you part? 
You are such a source of joy 
   To my lonely heart. 

Sweet Letters, Dear Letters, 
       What a tell you tell; 
O, no power on earth can break 
   This strange mystic spell! 

Dear Letters, Fond Letters, 
       You my secret know--
Don't you tell it, any one--   
   Let it live and grow.

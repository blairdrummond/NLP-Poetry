text : 
A doll's hair concealing   
an eggshell skull delicately   
throbbing, within which 
maggots in voluptuous unrest   
jostle and shrug. Oh, Eileen, my   
big doll, your gold hair was   
not more sunny than this 
human fur, but 
your head was 
radiant in its emptiness, 
a small clean room. 

Her warm and rosy mouth 
is telling lies—she would 
believe them if she could believe:   
her pretty eyes 
search out corruption. Oh, Eileen   
how kindly your silence was, and   
what virtue 
shone in the opening and shutting of your   
ingenious blindness.

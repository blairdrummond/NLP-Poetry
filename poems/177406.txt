Call me the bee buzzing in the museum.   
The younger sister fussing through a house   
still stiff with loss. 
The meddling goblin in the mausoleum. 

My dream: with three in the front seat, we drive   
under a bridge and halt. A huge gray bus   
blocks the whole road, including us, 
the only travelers who are left alive. 

It’s drizzling; the windshield wiper blades   
busily gesture, yet we’re nearly blind.   
You two seem not to mind 
blank windows, pulled-down shades. 

I mind. I want to get out and explore, 
to move around 
the deathly obstacle. “Don’t make a sound,” 
you say. (Who are you?) “Don’t go near that door.” 

Our mountain drive last month—that wasn’t dreamed.   
We three again. We ran a dog down. I 
alone looked back, alone let out a cry. 
I saw it lying in its blood and screamed. 

So tell me what these images portend.   
Am I a noisy bird of evil omen 
or just a person, apprehensive, human,   
moving ahead, kid sister into woman, 

stonewalled by death each time she rounds a bend?

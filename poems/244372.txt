title : Katrina

author : Patricia Smith

text : 
I was birthed restless and elsewhere
  
 gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning, slush,
 broke through with branches, steel
  
 I was bitch-monikered, hipped, I hefted
 a whip rain, a swirling sheet of grit.
  
 Scraping toward the first of you, hungering for wood, walls,
 unturned skin. With shifting and frantic mouth, I loudly loved
 the slow bones
  
 of elders, fools, and willows.

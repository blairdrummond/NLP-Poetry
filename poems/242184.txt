title : Vinegar

author : J. Patrick Lewis

text : 
It was such a lovely day
Till I stumbled in the way
Of a van that carries vinegar to stores. 
When I glared up at the man—
Operator of the van—
He said, “Vinegar, it never rains but pours!”

Now a skunk was standing by. 
And I thought that I would cry
From the vinegar that sprayed and soaked my clothes,
When the driver kindly yells,
“Watch that animal. It smells!”—
And the skunk ran off, a hankie to her nose.

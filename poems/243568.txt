title : Never Mind

author : Dorothea Tanning

text : 
Never mind the pins
 And needles I am on.
 Let all the other instruments
 Of torture have their way.
 While air-conditioners
 Freeze my coffee
 I watch the toaster
 Eating my toast.
 Did I press the right
 Buttons on all these
 Buttonless surfaces
 Daring me to press them?
 Did you gasp on seeing what 
 The mailman just brought?
  
 Will the fellow I saw pedaling
 Across the bridge live long
 After losing his left leg,
 His penis, and his bike
 To fearlessness?
 Will his sad wife find
 Consolation with the 
 Computer wizard called in
 Last year to deal with glitches?
  
 Did you defuse the boys’
 Bomb before your house
 Was under water, same 
 As everything else?
 Aunt Til grabbed her
 Silver hand mirror
 Before floating away.
 The dog yelped constantly,
 Tipping our canoe.
 Silly dog.

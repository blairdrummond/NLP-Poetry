title : A Lowrider Loudly Brings Us

author : W. S. Di Piero

text : 
a thing that's called radar love, 
the whole hog calling, 
and here's unhoused Ginger, 
distracted wind-beaten beauty 
separating from park bench 
and Frigidaire carton, 
flying Halloween colors,   
tie-dye skirt, Orangesicle socks, 
where will she sleep tonight, 
where lay those tulle angel wings   
slashed through her overcoat,   
who pulses anarchist patchouli   
and minty hair draughts 
and cigarette spirits that scuff   
our fragile air while we hope for 
some pick-me-up before we pass.

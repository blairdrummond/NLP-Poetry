title : Roman Room

Someday our buried life will come to this: 
a shaft of sunlight touching the Etruscan 
surfaces, the basin still intact 
as if awaiting hands. How many 

centuries sequestered is an expert's guess, 
you tell me. I admire the tiles 
some craftsman spiraled in the ceiling's dome 
detailing Neptune's beard. Or someone's. 

What will they say of us, who have no home 
(we like to say) but one another? When they pry 
our hearts apart and excavate the sum, 
is that the place we'll lie? Where the words lie?

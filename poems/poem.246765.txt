The morns are meeker than they were - (32) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England


Rhymed Stanza

The morns are meeker than they were - 
 The nuts are getting brown -
 The berry's cheek is plumper -
 The rose is out of town. 
  
 The maple wears a gayer scarf -
 The field a scarlet gown -
 Lest I sh'd be old-fashioned 
 I'll put a trinket on.

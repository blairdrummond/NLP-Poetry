THAT ONE, is a poet for all poets
AH, then I would suppose
to be an edwin for all edwins
OH, then there is only one of you
you are being one for
AH, I am one of me
but one is too many for all
OH, then how can this one be for all
when that one is truly for truly’s sake
Which one?
It isn’t a which or a what but a be
HMMPF, an ending for all endings
UMMPF, to be a poet for poets
is a mere suppose
BLECHH, you covered suppose in an earlier poem
YUCHH, but no one heard it
ARGH, they say a poem is heard when it is written
ERGH, then I have heard my entire life
as it happens
HOOOPHA, a mere one, an entire suppose,
this has been . . .
WAIT, are you implying an ending?
AHA, a being
OHO, now there is a poem
OOOOH, an ending
AHHHH, where there are so many to choose from

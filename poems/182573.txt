title : God’s Secretary

Her e-mail inbox always overflows.   
Her outbox doesn’t get much use at all.   
She puts on hold the umpteen-billionth call   
As music oozes forth to placate those   
Who wait, then disconnect. Outside, wind blows,   
Scything pale leaves. She sees a sparrow fall   
Fluttering to a claw-catch on a wall.   
Will He be in today? God only knows.   

She hasn’t seen His face—He’s so aloof.   
She’s long resigned He’ll never know or love her   
But still can wish there were some call, some proof   
That He requires a greater service of her.   
Fingers of rain now drum upon the roof,   
Coming from somewhere, somewhere far above her.

“Your great-grandfather was . . .” 

And Mrs. C, our tart old Scots   
landlady, with her stomping legs,   
four bristles sprouted from her chin- 
wart, she who briskly 
                                 chats away 
about Montrose, founder of her clan,   
as though she’s just now fresh   
from tea with him, 
                            regards you 
incredulously, a bastard gargoyle   
off some bastard architecture,   
one grown topsy-turvy: 
                                  “Not to know 
your great-grandfather! How do   
you live? O you Americans!” 
                                          She 
cannot see what freedom it affords,   
your ignorance, 
                        a space swept 
clear of all the clutter of lives   
lived. 
          And yet who can dismiss   
her words entirely? It burdens too,   
this emptiness, 
                        pervasive presence   
not a room away that, no matter   
how you hammer at its wall,   
refuses to admit you. 
                                 As though 
you woke and in a place you thought   
familiar, 
               then had a sense (what   
is it that has been disturbed?)   
of one you never met 
                               yet somehow 
knew—looks echoing among the dusty   
pictures: 
               that myopic glass   
reflecting, like a sunset lingered   
inside trees, 
                     a meditative smile:   
a breath warm to your cheek,   
your brow: 
                the hand (whose?)   
moving on your blanket in a gesture   
that you fail to recognize 

yet know it as you know 
the taste through oranges of sun- 
light current in them still— 

then gone as you began to stir.   
And for a moment dawn seems lost   
as in a mist, seems wistful 

for a feeling it cannot 
achieve . . . the sun breaks through,   
an instant medleying the leaves.

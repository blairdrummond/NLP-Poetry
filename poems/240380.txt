title : Night Heron Maybe

author : Fred Marchant

I woke to more rain, and felt in the dark
 for how wet the sill was, then rolled back
 to my radio, and a midnight preacher
 in my earphone teaching about sin.
  
 I learned that punishment would come
 like lightning that surprises an innocent shore.
 Thunder would follow me all my days,
 stern reminder and sharp rebuke.
  
 The long, sleek, and pointed call
 that rose, as if in response, out of the estuary
 of night and storm, said it knew well
 what the given world gave, and wanted more.

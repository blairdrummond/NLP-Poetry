Wasn't that your cheek against mine last night
Gin Streetlight When somebody loves you Impossible

When you reach the broken paddock fence 
the sign will say Impossible

The color God painted my eyes A cross 
between storm and ewerstream Impossible

All your wrong lovers without certificates 
Stamped across their foreheads Impossible

Dear Torch Received your kind invitation 
Regret conflagration impossible

You must mean a phantom Your hand at her waist 
Your ache at her absence Not mine Impossible

A holy place in the emperor's city 
A peach in a stone Impossible

You the mask of a ram I the mask of a bull 
Horn chips Mischling Torn doors Impossible

Dance without footprints Dance with no name 
in a room with no lovers not touching Impossible

Your eyes One protecting your sleeping son's dreaming 
One torchlit and trying to close Impossible

Dear Lion Here's a gazelle Hold her
in your teeth but no biting Yours Impossible

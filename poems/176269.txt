I’ll know the time to leave the room   
where I’ve been growing hair 
from my face, drinking dark beers   
when the light in the lake bums out.   
That’s when fish 
turn on their music. 
They lie in a blue current 
waiting for the moon 
to pass over, and the fishermen   
with their lanterns know this 
as they spill a can of sweet corn   
and wonder if they spoke 
what they were just thinking. 

I clear my way through the fog 
as music will break through static.   
The frogs strike up,   
a window goes out   
in the Home for Elders.   
Don’t you wonder why   
it is built far from anywhere, 
as though memory needs a terrain 
for forgetting; blind   
driveways to lost roads. 
As for my own parents, they did not   
grow old. What I know:   
dinners without conversation, 
stars that shine for anyone. 
I know my time 
is brief. I know love of the cut sleeve. 

I want to say 
don’t feel sorry for men,   
those who leave women   
smouldering like cigarettes,   
those who are fond of burials.   
War is a habit of mind, 
I swear by my mother’s gender. 

Tonight sticks in the leaves 
are slick as pilot snakes. 
Wherever I part branches 
no one is in a boat, 
no one has stirred a wake. 
Not jackknifing off the dock, 
it’s hauling myself back up 
that gooses my titties and makes my peter shrink. 

Don’t wake the cottonmouths.   
Summertime. If you were here 
and you remembered to stash your smokes 
in a Glad bag so they didn’t soak like mine 
we’d fall quiet now as pollen   
on water, I would 
tell you the true story of Urashima   
and the turtle.

title : At a Certain Age

author : Deborah Cummins

text : 
He sits beside his wife who takes the wheel.   
Clutching coupons, he wanders the aisles   
of Stop & Save.  There’s no place he must be,   
no clock to punch.  Sure,  
there are bass in the lake, a balsa model   
in the garage, the par-three back nine.   
But it’s not the same.   
Time the enemy then, the enemy now.   

As he points the remote at the screen    
or pauses at the window, staring    
into the neighbor’s fence but not really seeing it,    
he listens to his wife in the kitchen, more amazed    
than ever—how women seem to know    
what to do.  How, with their cycles and timers,   
their rolling boils and three-minute eggs,   
they wait for something to start.  Or stop.

title : Lines Depicting Simple Happiness

The shine on her buckle took precedence in sun 
Her shine, I should say, could take me anywhere 
It feels right to be up this close in tight wind 
It feels right to notice all the shiny things about you 
About you there is nothing I wouldnâ€™t want to know 
With you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler 
About you many good things come into relation 
I think of proofs and grammar, vowel sounds, like 
A is for knee socks, E for panties 
I is for buttondown, O the blouse you wear 
U is for hair clip, and Y your tight skirt 
The music picks up again, I am the man I hope to be 
The bright air hangs freely near your newly cut hair 
It is so easy now to see gravity at work in your face 
Easy to understand time, that dark process 
To accept it as a beautiful process, your face

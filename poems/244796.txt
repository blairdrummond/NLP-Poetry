text : 
watchdog howling (all caved in
 beyond the pale—tis my home
  
 cold wind implacable driven
 unaccounted sooth shawl of sorrow
  
 unplanned unmapped swallow order
 blunt trees mended like man
  
 even our shadows belabored in light
 commonplace rumble—shaken
  
 alliterative portrait of a ploughman
 struck down cattle thief
  
 contraband—pig iron—intermediate
 between two states & cargo untold
  
 undetected huckster amended airs
 an untapped inventory—catholic
  
 in the tall grass—laughing—mask
 chimerical goods for summer sink in

title : A Wedding

author : James Tate

text : 
She was in terrible pain the whole day, 
as she had been for months: a slipped disc,   
and there is nothing more painful. She 

herself was a nurse’s aide, also a poet   
just beginning to make a name for her   
nom de plume. As with most things in life, 

it happened when she was changing channels   
on her television. The lucky man, on the other   
hand, was smiling for the first time 

in his life, and it was fake. He was 
an aspiring philosopher of dubious potential,   
very serious, but somehow lacking in 

essential depth. He could have been 
an adequate undertaker. It was not the first   
time for either of them. It was a civil 

service, with no music, few flowers.   
Still, there was a slow and erratic tide 
of champagne—corks shot clear into the trees. 

And flashcubes, instant photos, some blurred   
and some too revealing, cake slices that aren’t   
what they were meant to be. The bride slept 

through much of it, and never did we figure out   
who was on whose team. I think the groom   
meant it in the end when he said, “We never 

thought anyone would come.” We were not the first   
to arrive, nor the last to leave. Who knows,   
it may all turn out for the best. And who 

really cares about such special days, they   
are not what we live for.

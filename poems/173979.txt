title : Song in the Songless

author : George Meredith

text : 
They have no song, the sedges dry,
         And still they sing.
It is within my breast they sing,
         As I pass by.
Within my breast they touch a string,
         They wake a sigh.
There is but sound of sedges dry;
         In me they sing.

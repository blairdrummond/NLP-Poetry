title : The Whistle

You could whistle me home from anywhere 
in the neighborhood; avenues away, 
I’d pick out your clear, alternating pair 
of notes, the signal to quit my child’s play 
and run back to our house for supper, 
or a Saturday trip to the hardware store. 
Unthrottled, wavering in the upper 
reaches, your trilled summons traveled farther 
than our few blocks. I’ve learned too, how your heart’s 
radius extends, though its beat 
has stopped. Still, some days a sudden fear darts 
through me, whether it’s my own city street 
I hurry across, or at a corner in an unknown 
town: the high, vacant air arrests me—where’s home?

title : Orpheus with his Lute Made Trees

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
Orpheus with his Lute made Trees, 
And the Mountaine tops that freeze, 
Bow themselues when he did sing. 
To his Musicke, Plants and Flowers 
Euer sprung; as Sunne and Showers, 
There had made a lasting Spring. 
Euery thing that heard him play, 
Euen the Billowes of the Sea, 
Hung their heads, & then lay by. 
In sweet Musicke is such Art, 
Killing care, & griefe of heart, 
Fall asleepe, or hearing dye.

Rhymed Stanza, Sonnet

Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white, 
    To make up my delight; 
    No odd becoming graces, 
Black eyes, or little know-not-whats in faces; 
Make me but mad enough, give me good store 
Of love for her I count; 
    I ask no more, 
'Tis love in love that makes the sport. 

There's no such thing as that we beauty call, 
    It is mere cozenage all; 
    For though some, long ago, 
Liked certain colors mingled so and so, 
That doth not tie me now from choosing new; 
If I a fancy take 
    To black and blue, 
That fancy doth it beauty make. 

'Tis not the meat, but 'tis the appetite 
    Makes eating a delight; 
    And if I like one dish 
More than another, that a pheasant is; 
What in our watches, that in us is found: 
So to the height and nick 
    We up be wound, 
No matter by what hand or trick.

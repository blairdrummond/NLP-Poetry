title : Sunflakes

author : Frank Asch

text : 
If sunlight fell like snowflakes, 
gleaming yellow and so bright, 
we could build a sunman, 
we could have a sunball fight, 
we could watch the sunflakes 
drifting in the sky. 
We could go sleighing 
in the middle of July 
through sundrifts and sunbanks, 
we could ride a sunmobile, 
and we could touch sunflakesâ€” 
I wonder how they'd feel.

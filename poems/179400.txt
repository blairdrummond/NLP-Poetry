title : A Poem That Starts Out Wrong

author : Landis Everson

text : 
Put nothing down to distress the reader. 
No barking dog. 
No rustle in the place whispers belong 
or photos of petals near collapse. 
Erase oranges of confusing taste, a face 
wrinkled or in pain, 
a map with waterless rivers or water 
without a bend, 
still in darkness. Here, where mystery 

beyond hope comes too near, 
make a bright flight of leaves 
descend, none to smear all our spotless 
rivers. A map folds and unfolds, does not 
bunch or wrinkle. Rainbows to last. 
The First Endlessness of Eden. 
This was the spot I was to start on, a leg 
steps out of the lake, 
a step falters instead into dashes that spread without prints onto the screaming bank.

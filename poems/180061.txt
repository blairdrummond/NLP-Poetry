title : I Thought of Donne

author : I Thought of Donne Elizabeth McFarland

text : 
I thought of   Donne, and how the pride must war — 
Of  Manley Hopkins, godlier by far, 
His filial bemusement death and birth 
Counting the spots of   God on this, God's earth. 

And then, asleep, I dreamed of  Henry Ford 
Wandering beardless down orchestral ways 
Of  factories. A patriarchal lord, 
Counting his beads of  praise.

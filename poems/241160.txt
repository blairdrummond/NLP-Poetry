title : Remaking a Neglected Orchard

author : Nathaniel Perry

text : 
It was a good idea, cutting away
the vines and ivy, trimming back 
the chest-high thicket lazy years 
had let grow here. Though it wasn’t for lack

of love for the trees, I’d like to point out. 
Years love trees in a way we can’t 
imagine. They just don’t use the fruit 
like us; they want instead the slant

of sun through narrow branches, the buckshot 
of rain on these old cherries. And we, 
now that I think on it, want those 
things too, we just always and desperately

want the sugar of the fruit, the best 
we’ll get from this irascible land: 
sweetness we can gather for years, 
new stains staining the stains on our hands.

Ultimately improved by it:slant light
hitting his prison obliquely

near the state bird’s pointed headaccentuated 
crest, the black-ringed bill 

from which wheat-wheat-wheat-wheat 
from which whoit cheer, whoit cheer;cheer- cheer-cheer 

inspired Ronald Cotton to listen 
as in his head, the solitary cardinalindulged in snails   

which seemed like polished fossils 
of trophy hog tails(after prize         butchery) 

that Ronald was able to recall, 
his hair a mess of replicas of them 

as industrious as the state 
whose success was poultry & eggstobacco & soybeans 

as well as convictions: 

None as tightly knit as Jennifer’s(not even the state flag) 
that she could identify Cotton 

that cotton’s taking on appearancesother than burst white   
of a dense localized haze from whichto weave memory, following 
pink-petaled start, rather a satellitedish of a flower, pollen/sensor- 
studded antenna protruding fromthe center 

undeniably; the jury couldn’t acquitCotton 
of its role in documenting and alteringJennifer’s history, 

many lives changed   

as result of consequences, sensorsthat boast duality   
of receptor and transmitter: witness:insects give and take, taint 
what is put out, taken in; mix 

it up so that interrelatednessspreads 
and the understandable error ofmetaphor   
becomes less erroneous over time: 
eleven years in prison, innocencelocked up, protected 

although in prison, it resembledsomething else. 
If Cotton strained, he could seethe top   

of a Ferris wheel on the horizonjust a possible 
segment of a rainbow the lengthof a chain 

of cardinal feathers 

even though it wasn’t that at all.The eye witnesses all the time,   
even the unseeing eye is turnedtoward a focus 
on black, saturation dense asconviction; the eye 

processes, pulls in whole vista to aretinal speck 
of convergence 

which is to say there is some Cottonin Poole, 
some connection, independentshared participation in cold   
beer, occasional cards turkey-spread   
in the right hand without knowingthe other 
sank into the seat at the cinemathe same way 

and sampled Funnel cake at thestate fair 
within a week of each other 

and more than that in common:both being men 
and convicted for what men really can and really do, do.   

Including sometimes confessionsand apologies; cash reparations 

after the innocence is free to extend its parameters 
to unlocked doors, be an oversizedover-zealous white bird   
floating down the aisle, its cottonyhaze lifted   
in order to kiss and marry Ronald’scalm delight in being able   
to take his time 

leave his longshoreman’s mark onships   
that take some of him to any port in the world: durable goods 

such as the DNA whose precisiondetects human exactitude,   
and could build as many Ronalds as time would permit 

something Jennifer now desperately wants to do, restoring 
what was lost because it was likesomething else, 

because the fact of similarityis compelling, convincing; 
if connections could not be made,there’d be no havens, no fugitive
status lost to fusion, no linksto God, no human   

murmurings whoseconstant echoes   
are also the gentle silvery humof fans praying   
over computer motors to cool themand also mimic   
motion of small wings amplifiedto make sound 

in the distance much likethe electric razor 
preparing a head on death row clean as a light bulb. 


Ronald was prepared to be believed;   
he saw the quiet manner of his long days in court 
as evidence of his rationality andcontemplativeness 

such as befits clergy; a potentialpropensity for order, 
mercy, the steadiness required todispense blessings 
mostly on the undeserving withoutemotion or judgment 
selfishness or preference 

while he was being judged guilty forlack of emotion, 
for Jennifer’s incontrovertible emotional insistence   
on Cotton’s being the one—she hadto finger him   
to be comfortable within her survival.No way to mistake 
to ever forget details documented inmemory, 
the event relived to the point that itresculpted her brain 
into a Cottony bust (he was thereto be the perfect model) 

whose reality floated awayin a Poole,   
as only the reflection of Cotton   

identified as source. A situationalso called (must-have)                  moonlight. 


Here’s the new & improved Cotton:
               eleven years in the making;enough 
time served to anger to ruin it; at thatsame room’s temperature 
it became doubt of clemency, pardon:peculiar butter that erupted   
as gratefulness for the miracle of absolute exoneration   
when his impossibility as rapistwas proven. 

Even Cotton conceded thatthe composite sketch   
bore a just resemblance to Cotton,displayed a metaphor for men   
like Cotton, the seeds of capabilityin the structure of the face,   
the human repertoire that includesCotton   
who softly consents to meet Jennifer when she asks him to 
funnel her regret and apologies deep into himself, accepting that 
she meant no malice toward himbut toward 
the perpetrator whom many menresemble, all 
brothers, family   

of man resemblance; Cotton’sown daughter, Cotton’s                            own wife 
could be in a similar position; nooffense 
taken, captivated by the beauty ofJennifer; her superior logic 

refusing to let the crime against her 
silence her; as sure, as certain, asdazzling   
about speaking up about mistakingCotton for Poole 
as she was in identifyingin the lineup 
the closest thing there to Poolethe best 
available, the incrediblelikeness 
that memory seized, filling gaps inthe recollected Poole 
with Cotton’s particulars.She felt better in her cotton-          touched skin. 

Metaphor is a form of forgiveness; a short rope of it knots-up   
those that can’t come together any other way into being defined   
by the other. Strange   

and estranged pairings give rise to mutable truth 
that can yield to both dawn and twilight 
demands that things be seen differently. 


Jennifer in moonlight instead of being illuminated moon whose face 
was also in Emmett Till’s way, but this generation of Jennifer has another side 
home late after a day of good faithin which she and Cotton team up 
at a church to speak up about doubtas less a shadow than certainty. 

Memory is as accurate as metaphor, an overlay 
that always fits something, that like the purest 
most sparkling water is too naïvenot to submit   
to any vessel into which it’s poured.Just to be guzzled. 

Perhaps the vessel in which cottonbecomes a pool 
in which North Carolina is shapedlike an embryo: 

Humanity still on the brinkof infancy.

title : All My Activities Are Feeding Activities

text : 
Dear Commissioner 
here are my directive accounts 
of genitals and cash 
now bring me your goods

We don't live among fowlers 
Not all poisonous juices are burning 
or bitter nor is everything now 
which is burning and bitter poisonous

Air is removed from the workspace 
and dispersed into the multiverse 
It's very strict metadata 
You get echoes and dropouts

For the most part 
Juliet is gaseous now 
as a caucasian she gets it 
on the head and face and I move 
from hypocrisy to cynicism

Cristal all over the face and neck 
concrete and glinting 
audible light on jumbotron
marmalade for miles 
That good wood kept calling my name 
Behavior meet Behavior, Behavior 
meat all the social organs

title : 1851: A Message to Denmark Hill

author : Richard Howard

The writer is John Ruskin, on his wedding journey in Venice.
My dearest father, it is the year’s First Day, 
      Yet so like the Last, in Venice, no one 
            Could tell this birth from the lees. 
                  I know it is some while 
Since you received a word of mine: there has been   
      The shabbiest sort of interruption   
            To our exchanges (to mine 
                  At least) in the shape 
Of a fever—nights of those imaginings,   
      Strange but shameful too, of the Infinite   
            By way of bedcovers and 
                  Boa constrictors, 
With cold wedges of ice, as I thought, laid down   
      At the corners of the bed, making me   
            Slip to its coiling center 
                  Where I could not breathe.   
You knew from my last, I think, I had again 
      Gone to the Zoological Gardens 
            And seen the great boa take 
                  Rabbits, which gave me   
An idea or two, and a headache. Then 
      I had too much wine that same night, & dreamed 
            Of a walk with Nurse, to whom 
                  I showed a lovely 
Snake I promised her was an innocent one: 
      It had a slender neck with a green ring 
            Round it, and I made her feel 
                  The scales. When she bade 
Me feel them too, it turned to a fat thing, like   
      A leech, and adhered to my hand, so that   
            I could scarcely pull it off— 
                  And I awakened 
(So much, father, for my serpentine fancies)   
      To a vermillion dawn, fever fallen, 
            And the sea horizon dark, 
                  Sharp and blue, and far 
Beyond it, faint with trebled distance, came on   
      The red vertical cliffs in a tremor 
            Of light I could not see without   
                  Recalling Turner 
Who had taught me so to see it, yet the whole   
      Subdued to one soft gray. And that morning   
            I had your letter, father, 
                  Telling of the death 
Of my earthly master. How much more I feel   
      This now (perhaps it is worth noting here   
            The appearance of my first 
                  Gray hair, this morning) 
—More than I thought I should: everything 
      In the sun, in the sky so speaks of him, 
            So mourns their Great Witness lost. 
                  Today, the weather 
Is wretched, cold and rainy, dark like England   
      At this season. I do begin to lose 
            All faith in these provinces. 
                  Even the people 
Look to me ugly, except children from eight   
      To fourteen, who here as in Italy 
            Anywhere are glorious: 
                  So playful and bright 
In expression, so beautiful in feature, 
      So dark in eye and soft in hair—creatures   
            Quite unrivalled. At fifteen 
                  They degenerate 
Into malignant vagabonds, or sensual 
      Lumps of lounging fat. And this latter-day 
            Venice, father! where by night 
                  The black gondolas 
Are just traceable beside one, as if Cadmus 
      Had sown the wrong teeth and grown dragons, not 
            Men. The Grand Canal, this month, 
                  Is all hung, from end 
To end, with carpets and tapestries like a street 
      Of old-clothes warehouses. And now there is 
            Even talk of taking down, 
                  Soon, Tintoretto’s   
Paradise to “restore” it. Father, without 
      The Turner Gallery, I do believe 
            I should go today and live 
                  In a cave on some 
Cliffside—among crows. Oh what fools they are, this 
      Restoring pack, yet smoothing all manner 
            Of rottenness up with words.   
                  My Turner would not 
Phrase like these, and only once in all the years 
      I knew him said, “Thank you, Mr. Ruskin.” 
            My own power, if it be that,   
                  Would be lost by mere 
Fine Writing. You know I promised no Romance— 
      I promised them Stones. Not even bread. 
            Father, I do not feel any 
                  Romance in Venice!   
Here is no “abiding city,” here is but 
      A heap of ruins trodden underfoot 
            By such men as Ezekiel 
                  Angrily describes, 
Here are lonely and stagnant canals, bordered 
      For the most part by blank walls of gardens 
            (Now waste ground) or by patches 
                  Of mud, with decayed   
Black gondolas lying keel-upmost, sinking 
      Gradually into the putrid soil. 
            To give Turner’s joy of this 
                  Place would not take ten 
Days of study, father, or of residence: 
      It is more than joy that must be the great   
            Fact I would teach. I am not sure,   
                  Even, that joy is 
A fact. I am certainly only of the strong   
      Instinct in me (I cannot reason this)   
            To draw, delimit the things 
                  I love—oh not for 
Reputation or the good of others or 
      My own advantage, but a sort of need, 
            Like that for water and food. 
                  I should like to draw 
All Saint Mark’s, stone by stone, and all this city,   
      Oppressive and choked with slime as it is   
            (Effie of course declares, each 
                  Day, that we must leave: 
A woman cannot help having no heart, but   
      That is hardly a reason she should have   
            No manners), yes, to eat it 
                  All into my mind— 
Touch by touch. I have been reading Paradise  
      Regained lately, father. It seems to me   
            A parallel to Turner’s 
                  Last pictures—the mind 
Failing altogether, yet with intervals 
      And such returns of power! “Thereupon   
            Satan, bowing low his gray   
                  Dissimulation, 
Disappeared.” Now he is gone, my dark angel, 
      And I never had such a conception 
            Of the way I must mourn—not 
                  What I lose, now, but 
What I have lost, until now. Yet there is more   
      Pain knowing that I must forget it all,   
            That in a year I shall have 
                  No more awareness 
Of his loss than of that fair landscape I saw,   
      Waking, the morning your letter arrived, 
            No more left about me than 
                  A fading pigment. 
All the present glory, like the present pain, 
      Is no use to me; it hurts me rather 
            From my fear of leaving it, 
                  Of losing it, yet 
I know that were I to stay here, it would soon 
      Cease being glory to me—that it has 
            Ceased, already, to produce 
                  The impression and 
The delight. I can bear only the first days   
      At a place, when all the dread of losing   
            Is lost in the delirium 
                  Of its possession. 
I daresay love is very well when it does not   
      Mean leaving behind, as it does always, 
            Somehow, with me. I have not 
                  The heart for more now, 
Father, though I thank you and Mother for all   
      The comfort of your words. They bring me, 
            With his loss, to what I said 
                  Once, the lines on this 
Place you will know: “The shore lies naked under   
      The night, pathless, comfortless and infirm 
            In dark languor, still except 
                  Where salt runlets plash 
Into tideless pools, or seabirds flit from their   
      Margins with a questioning cry.” The light 
            Is gone from the waters with 
                  My fallen angel, 
Gone now as all must go. Your loving son, 
                                                 JOHN

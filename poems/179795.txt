Like the waxwings in the juniper, 
a dozen at a time, divided, paired, 
passing the berries back and forth, and by 
nightfall, wobbling, piping, wounded with joy. 

Or a party of redwings grazing what 
falls—blossom and seed, nutmeat and fruit— 
made light in the head and cut by the light, 
swept from the ground, carried downwind, taken.... 

It's called wing-rowing, the wing-burdened arms 
unbending, yielding, striking a balance, 
walking the white invisible line drawn 
just ahead in the air, first sign the slur, 

the liquid notes too liquid, the heart in 
the mouth melodious, too close, which starts 
the chanting, the crooning, the long lyric 
silences, the song of our undoing. 

It's called side-step, head-forward, raised-crown, flap- 
and-glide-flight aggression, though courtship is 
the object, affection the compulsion, 
love the overspill—the body nodding, 

still standing, ready to fly straight out of 
itself—or its bill-tilt, wing-flash, topple- 
over; wing-droop, bowing, tail-flick and drift; 
back-ruffle, wingspread, quiver and soar. 

Someone is troubled, someone is trying, 
in earnest, to explain; to speak without 
swallowing the tongue; to find the perfect 
word among so few or the too many— 

to sing like the thrush from the deepest part 
of the understory, territorial, 
carnal, thorn-at-the-throat, or flutelike 
in order to make one sobering sound. 

Sound of the breath blown over the bottle, 
sound of the reveler home at dawn, light of 
the sun a warbler yellow, the sun in 
song-flight, lopsided-pose. Be of good-cheer, 

my father says, lifting his glass to greet 
a morning in which he's awake to be 
with the birds: or up all night in the sleep 
of the world, alive again, singing.

title : Introduction to Poetry

author : Billy Collins

text : 
I ask them to take a poem   
and hold it up to the light   
like a color slide 

or press an ear against its hive. 

I say drop a mouse into a poem   
and watch him probe his way out, 

or walk inside the poem’s room   
and feel the walls for a light switch. 

I want them to waterski   
across the surface of a poem 
waving at the author’s name on the shore. 

But all they want to do 
is tie the poem to a chair with rope   
and torture a confession out of it. 

They begin beating it with a hose   
to find out what it really means.

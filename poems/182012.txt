title : Charles Graner Is Not America

author : Geoffrey Brock

Let’s get this straight: Charles Graner   
is not America. America would never   
hold a knife to his wife’s throat, then say 
when she woke that he was considering 
killing her. And America’s wife in turn 
would never call her husband “my own 
Hannibal Lecter.” Am I right, or what?   
Charles Graner may be Hannibal Lecter,   
but he is not America. America is not that   
kind of husband. Nor would America email 
his adolescent children photos of himself 
torturing naked Iraqi prisoners and say 
“look what Daddy gets to do!” Am I right? 
America is not that kind of father. America   
would never torture naked Iraqi prisoners.   
Let’s be absolutely clear about all of this. 
And America’s ex-lover and co-defendant 
would never whisper to the sketch artist   
at America’s trial: “You forgot the horns.”   
Charles Graner may or may not have horns, 
but America is horn-free. America does not 
torture prisoners. America may render them,   
fully clothed, to Egypt or Syria, for further   
interrogation, or to men like Charles Graner,   
but America is not, ipso facto, Egypt or Syria,   
and Charles Graner is not now nor has he ever 
been America. And don’t talk to me about 
Guantanamo. Please! Let’s get this straight.   
You and I know who America is. We know   
what America does and doesn’t do, because we 
(not Charles Graner!) are America. Am I right?   
Is this all clear? Tell me—am I right, or what?

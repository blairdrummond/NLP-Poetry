title : Contempt

author : Elfriede Jelinek

text : 
my puppet-strings are the 
sweet decaying lamps I flutter round. 

I am as immense 
as a black kid with a spinning top. 

drowned tripper fat 
crawls into hollow cuffs to be sewn up 
like hot cats 
cracked soft caryatids in tails. 

I'll force you all to your knees 
your dirty muzzles will squawk 
out of your faces. 

and I will continue to climb 
I'll spread my thin arms along the queer walls 
till they bleed. 

I'll reach into threadbare velvet 
so that you bash yourselves like poor moths 
on corners of night. 

the reason I'm here is 
to scratch all the white bellies 
squatting down there. 

your stupid silence I will â€‰just 
toss up in the air. 

I am as sky high 
as all your staring regards laid end to end 
on the ground somewhere 
lies my broken smile.

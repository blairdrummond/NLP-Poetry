I’m a frogman. Naked by the water 
Under a lean of canvas she’d sewn 
With a thick paraffin thread, 
She gestured. When we pulled him 
From the river 
His left leg was meal. Crayfish in the hair. 
The river bottom left his shoulder 
Layered and crocheted— 
My sister’s pearl knitting needles 
Clicking in my head. I told 
The sheriff I wouldn’t do it again. 

I knew him once. His Chevy threw a rod. 
I made it with him 
On the hood of the old truck. 
It was out at the dump beyond Yuma. 
It felt like I had bread crumbs 
All over my mouth. Wacky with the sun, 
I sure did it with him enough 
That afternoon. I didn’t 

Know it was him who’d drowned. 
They said it was his cousin. 
He had a three-cornered scar 
At the small of his back. And a deposit 
Of calcium on the tailbone. 
We’re not much, you know? 

He was tangled in yellow tree roots, 
He spun in the currents, 
A fishhook and line running 
From his thumb. 
A whole new ball of wax, I thought. 

I wanted to be an astronaut. 
But failed the mathematics 
Twice in one summer. 
So I raise Nubian goats. 
My favorite has a purple manure 
That comes out like steaming packets 
Of tobacco mulch. He sprays 
The shack with his seed— 
It hasn’t needed paint in three years. 

I just took my shorts off 
When you two came down the hill. 
It’s that rubber suit I wear 
When I dive into the chute and cave. 
Sometimes I just feel 
Like old air in a patched tire. Then, 
I get my Seagram’s and come out here. 
You two look married. Not that I care. 
You wouldn’t believe what I was just thinking— 
Your husband’s the only living man 
Left in this country 
Who knows that I bleach my hair.

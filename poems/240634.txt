title : Thoughts While Walking

author : Rachel Wetzsteon

I hate the travel logs that tell you
 more about the pain than the place,
 yet here I am again, narrating
  
 the same old story to myself
 time after time. The papers circling
 in an alley, watched by a hunchback,
  
 mimic my plans and their preventer;
 when an old man treats the drycleaner
 to a lengthy sermon on spotting,
  
 I collect it; bloated clouds spell
 messages that people stopped hearing
 long ago, and as for the hag
  
 who runs at me, arms open, mouth bleeding?
 She’s my future, my terrible double.
 Always I head out, hot for details,
  
 and always the details start revolving
 around brave ingénues who put their
 innocent hands in wicked bonfires.
  
 I could never go for ten minutes
 without seeing fissures as faces,
 and I confess a hopeless weakness
  
 for the types who come back from travels,
 gather their fans around and tell them
 stories of order or of wonder:
  
 seashores and meadows sometimes get so
 muffled and many-voiced that tourists
 storm in and do their talking for them—
  
 It’s addictive, magical, vital.
 But I’ve observed how, more and more, these
 promising outings are becoming
  
 meta-walks and mechanized phrases:
 “When I ventured into the outback,
 how it blared back echoes of me,
  
 my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness.”
 Meanwhile forces of good and evil
 squirm and flourish under the carpet,
  
 mocking the visionary moment’s
 sweeping appeal. I’ll go on going
 out for scenes of horror and pleasure,
  
 but I’ll start pursuing clues leading
 to the return of that enormous,
 fertile ground between shouting and silence.

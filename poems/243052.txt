I. Mother (1892-1973)
  
 My mother, with a skin of crêpe de Chine,
 Predominantly yellow-colored, sheer
 Enough to let the venous blue show through
 The secondarily bluish carapace,
 Coughs, rasps, and rattles in her terminal
 Dream, interrupted by lucidities,
 When, suctioned out and listening with hard
 Ears almost waned to stone, she hears me say,
 “Mother, we’re here. The two of us are here.
 Anne’s here with me,” and she says, “Anne is so—
 So pretty,” as if abdicating all
 Her principalities of prettiness—
 So noted in her teens, when she smote all
 Who saw her shake a leg upon the stage
 Of vaudeville—and sinking into deeps
 Where ancience lurks, and barebone toothlessness,
 And bareback exits from the centre ring
 Of cynosure. Of little, less is left
 When we leave: a stick figure of a once
 Quite formidable personage. It is,
 Therefore, no shock, when next day the call comes
 From my worn father, followed by the spade
 Engaged upon hard January earth
 In Bellevue Cemetery, where he sways
 And cries for fifty years of joint returns
 Unjointed, and plucks one carnation from
 The grave bouquet of springing flowers upon
 The medium-priced coffin of veneer,
 To press and keep as a venereal
 Greenness brought forward from the greying past.
  
  
 II. Father (1895-1974)
  
 Whether the rivals for a wife and mother can
 Compose their differences and timely warp
 Into concomitant currents, taken by
 The selfsame tide when taken at the flood—
 Great waters poured black downhill at the height
 Of melting in the middle of the night—
 Is to be seen. We did not find it so. 
 My father, whom I loved as if he’d done
 All his devoirs (though he had not), and shone
 Upon my forehead like a morning sun,
 Came home out of his hospital to stay
 In our rich, alien house, where trappings tried
 His niggard monkishness. Four days he stayed
 In his ashen cocoon; the fifth he died
 Under my ministrations, his pug jaw
 Thrust out toward the port of hopelessness,
 Where he (I hope) received the sirens of
 All possible welcoming tugs, even as I
 Felt under his grey, waxen nose for breath
 And called the doctor to record a death
 That made shift rather easier for me,
 Staring at nothing standing out to sea.
  
  
 III. Tras Os Montes (197-)
  
 1. In Company
  
 Inspecting their kit and equipment at first light,
 I am glad the dawn is behind me, so my friends
 Cannot reflect upon my tears. The province I
 Move on across the mountains is still night-
 Bound, deep beneath the reaches of the sun
 Across the passes; so it will remain
 All of this long and dusty day, while we—
 Will, Joe, Bob, Jonathan, Garth, Peter, Paul,
 Ed, John, Phil, Harry, and a droptic me—
 March up the sunstruck slopes, dots on the rock
 That jags two thousand metres high ahead
 Of us above the passes where the dead
 Take formal leave of life: a kiss on both
 Cheeks of the dear departing, medals stripped,
 With all due ceremony, from his breast,
 Both epaulets cut loose from their braid stays,
 His sword, unbroken, pommelled in the hand
 Of his reliever; lastly, a salute
 Fired by the arms of officers, the guns 
 Of other ranks, and a flat bugle call
 Played on a battered Spanish instrument
 With ragged tassels as the body falls
 Over the parapet—gaining weightlessness
 As its flesh deliquesces, as its bones
 Shiver to ashes—into an air that crawls
 With all the arts of darkness far below.
  
  
 2. A Deux
  
 A new scenario: on upswept slopes
 Of ripe green wheat—rare in this country—we
 Take, linked, a last long walk. In late July,
 The landscape waits, breath bated, on the whim
 Of cumulonimbi in the west, which roll
 In with deceptive stealth, revealing a 
 Black heart cut with a cicatrice of fire,
 Zigzagging to its ground: a naked peak 
 Kilometres away, a serra out
 Of mind. I fix your face with a wax smile.
 Our hands articulate our oneness, soon
 To dissipate, in a stiff splay of joints.
 Is all the language at my tongue’s command
 Too little to announce my stammered thanks
 For your unquestioning hand at my side,
 Too much to say I know the lowly deuce
 Is a poor card to play beside the ace,
 Black with his curlicues and his strong pulse
 Of sauve qui peut ambition? Calling a spade
 A spade, I’m pierced with the extreme regret
 Of one who dies intestate; as I’m snatched
 Into the stormcloud from the springing field,
 From green to black, I spy on you, below,
 A lone maid in green wheat, and rain farewells
 And late apologies on your grey head,
 And thunder sorrows and regrets. The storm
 Goes east, and the sun picks out my remains
 Against the cloud: a tentative rainbow,
 An inverse, weak, and spectral kind of smile.
  
  
 3. Alone
  
 The long march up the fulvous ridgebacks to
 The marches, the frontiers of difference—
 Where flesh marches with bone, day marches with
 His wife the night, and country marches with
 Another country—is accomplished best,
 By paradox, alone. A world of twos,
 Of yangs and yins, of lives and objects, of 
 Sound grasses and deaf stones, is best essayed
 By sole infiltrators who have cast off
 Their ties to living moorings, and stand out
 Into the roads of noon approaching night
 Casting a single shadow, earnest of 
 Their honorable intention to lay down
 Their lives for their old country, humankind,
 In the same selfish spirit that inspired
 Their lifelong journey, largely and at last
 Alone, across the passes that divide
 A life from every other, the sheer crags
 Of overweening will, the deepening scarps
 Like brain fissures that cunningly cut off
 Each outcrop from the main and make it one
 While its luck lasts, while its bravura holds
 Against all odds, until the final climb
 Across the mountains to the farther shore
 Of sundown on the watersheds, where self,
 Propelled by its last rays, sways in the sway
 Of the last grasses and falls headlong in
 The darkness of the dust it is part of
 Upon the passes where we are no more:
 Where the recirculating shaft goes home
 Into the breast that armed it for the air,
 And, as we must expect, the art that there
 Turned our lone hand into imperial Rome
 Reverts to earth and its inveterate love
 For the inanimate and its return.

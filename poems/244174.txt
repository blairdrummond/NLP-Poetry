title : Philomena’s Revenge

author : Rita Ann Higgins

text : 
As a teenager
 she was like any other,
 boys, the craic,
 smoking down the backs.
  
 Later there was talk
 she broke things,
 furniture and glass,
 her mother’s heart.
  
 ‘Mad at the world,’
 the old women nod,
 round each other’s faces.
  
 But it was more
 than that
 and for less
 she was punished.
  
 That weekend
 she didn’t leave a cup alone
 every chair hit the wall,
 Philomena’s revenge.
  
 Soon after
 she was shifted
 and given the shocks.
  
 Round each other’s faces
 the old women nod
 ‘Treatment, treatment
 they’ve given her the treatment.’
  
 These days
 she gets on with the furniture,
 wears someone else’s walk,
 sees visions in glass.
  
 She’s good too
 for getting the messages;
 small things, bread and milk
 sometimes the paper,
  
 and closing the gate
 after her father drives out,
 she waits for his signal
 he always shouts twice,
  
 ‘Get the gate Philo,
 get the gate, girl.’

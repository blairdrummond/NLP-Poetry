title : I Am But a Traveler in This Land & Know Little of Its Ways

Is everything a field of energy caused 
by human projection? From the crib bars 
hang the teething tools. Above the finger-drummed   
desk, a bit lip. The cyclone fence of buts 

surrounds the soccer field of what if. 
Sometimes it seems like a world where no one   
knows what he or she is doing, eight lanes   
both directions. How about a polymer 

that contracts in response to electrical 
charge? A swimming pool on the 18th floor?   
King Lear done by sock puppets? Anyone 
who has traveled here knows the discrepancies 

between idea and fact. The idea is the worm   
in the tequila and the next day is the fact.   
In between may be the sacred—real blood   
from the wooden virgin’s eyes, and the hoax— 

landing sites in cornfields. Maybe ideas 
are best sprung from actions like the children   
of Zeus. One gives us elastic and the omelette,   
another nightmares and SUVs. There’s considerable 

wobble in the system, and the fan belt screams,   
waking the baby. Swaying in the darkened   
nursery, kissing the baby-smelling head:   
good idea! But also sadness looking at the sea. 

The stranded whale, guided out of the cove   
by tugboats, turns and swims back in.   
The violinist will not let go her violin   
which is 200 years old and still on the train 

thus she is dragged down the track. By what 
manner is the soul joined to the body?   
Answer: an arm connecting a violin 
to a violinist. According to Freud, 

there are no accidents. Astrologists 
and Presbyterians agree for different reasons.   
You fall down the stairs with a birthday cake.   
You try to fit a blunderbuss into a laptop. 

Human consciousness: is it the projector 
or the screen? They come in orange jumpsuits   
and spray the grass so everything dies 
but the grass. It is too late to ask Kafka 

what he thinks. Sometimes they give you   
a box of ash, a handshake, and the rest   
is your problem. In one version, 
the beggar turns out to be a king and grants 

the poor couple a castle and a moat and two   
silver horses said to be sired by the wind. 
That was before dentistry, which might have been   
a better gift. You did not want to get sick   
in the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th centuries. 

So too the 19th and 20th were to be avoided 
but the doctor coming to bleed you is the master   
of the short story. After the kiss from whom   
he will never know, the lieutenant, going home, 

touches a bush in which birds are singing.

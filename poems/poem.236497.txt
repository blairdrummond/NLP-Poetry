Nothing to Do 
James Ephraim McGirt 
1874-1930

U.S., Southern
Social Commentaries



The fields are white;
   The laborers are few;
Yet say the idle:
   There's nothing to do.

Jails are crowded;
   In Sunday-schools few;
We still complain:
   There's nothing to do.

Drunkards are dying--
   Your sons, it is true;
Mothers' arms folded
   With nothing to do.

Heathens are dying;
   Their blood falls on you;
How can you people
   Find nothing to do?

La luna
 Sang the miles por los palos
 de Nebraska
 You bunch of lights
 And houses    How did you walk
 to this place
 Buffalo Bill
 Better know him some Spanish
 Para Horses    ride
 rubber horseshoes
 moderno.
  
 El café
 Boiled water/no milk in sight.
 Homes that will travel interstate
 8 o tomorrow in the morning
 for the next edge of town.
  
 The cowgirls/the local rodeo
 As they galloped by their hair
 unmoved by 15 miles per hour wind
 It seems that 25 pounds of hair spray
 is enough to hold a mountain down
 Their hair style longer than their
 faces.
 Que Pasa?
 Y los palos
 do not feel at home any more
 La luna
 goes round the star dotted cielo
 Let’s watch
 In this part of Mexico
 Se habla inglish.

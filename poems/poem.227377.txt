Allusion, Sonnet

At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow 
Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise 
From death, you numberless infinities 
Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go; 
All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow, 
All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies, 
Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes 
Shall behold God and never taste death's woe. 
But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space, 
For if above all these my sins abound, 
'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace 
When we are there; here on this lowly ground 
Teach me how to repent; for that's as good 
As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood.

title : I Found a Four-Leaf Clover

I found a four-leaf clover 
and was happy with my find, 
but with time to think it over, 
I’ve entirely changed my mind. 
I concealed it in my pocket, 
safe inside a paper pad, 
soon, much swifter than a rocket, 
my good fortune turned to bad. 

       I smashed my fingers in a door, 
       I dropped a dozen eggs, 
       I slipped and tumbled to the floor, 
       a dog nipped both my legs, 
       my ring slid down the bathtub drain, 
       my pen leaked on my shirt, 
       I barked my shin, I missed my train, 
       I sat on my dessert. 

I broke my brand-new glasses, 
and I couldn’t find my keys, 
I stepped in spilled molasses, 
and was stung by angry bees. 
When the kitten ripped the curtain, 
and the toast burst into flame, 
I was absolutely certain 
that the clover was to blame. 

       I buried it discreetly 
       in the middle of a field, 
       now my luck has changed completely, 
       and my wounds have almost healed. 
       If I ever find another, 
       I will simply let it be, 
       or I’ll give it to my brother— 
       he deserves it more than me.

Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

I saw a man this morning
      Who did not wish to die
 I ask, and cannot answer,
      If otherwise wish I.
  
 Fair broke the day this morning
      Against the Dardanelles;
 The breeze blew soft, the morn's cheeks
      Were cold as cold sea-shells.
  
 But other shells are waiting
      Across the Aegean sea,
 Shrapnel and high explosive,
      Shells and hells for me.
  
 O hell of ships and cities,
      Hell of men like me,
 Fatal second Helen,
      Why must I follow thee?
  
 Achilles came to Troyland
      And I to Chersonese:
 He turned from wrath to battle,
      And I from three days' peace.
  
 Was it so hard, Achilles,
      So very hard to die?
 Thou knewest and I know not--
      So much the happier I.
  
 I will go back this morning
      From Imbros over the sea;
 Stand in the trench, Achilles,
      Flame-capped, and shout for me.

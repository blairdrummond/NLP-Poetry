stepping off the curb onto the right foot, the left foot
 following in due time, dragging a heavy weight that goes “thud”
 as if falls those few inches
           collective guilt cannot fit inside individualism
  
           In the cabinet under the bathroom sink, the household
 items, bottles and canisters of detergent, Pledge Lemon Trigger,
 and, along the inner corners of the cabinet and its edges,—dark
 stains, eukaryotic organisms, branched filamentous hyphae
          —screaming and pointing at the crud
  
           women whose hair was stiffened into “beehives,” as they
 were called,—
 —canceling out the odor-producing glands under their shaven
 armpits by spraying on chasm lice chemicals

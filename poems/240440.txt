title : Willingly

When I get up he has been long at work,
 his brush limber against the house.
 Seeing him on his ladder under the eaves,
 I look back on myself asleep in the dream
 I  could not carry awake. Sleep
 inside a house that is being painted,
 whole lifetimes now only the familiar cast
 of morning light over the prayer plant.
 This “not remembering” is something new
 of where you have been.
  
 What was settled or unsettled in sleep
 stays there. But your house
 under this steady arm is leaving itself
 and you see this gradual surface of
 new light covering your sleep
 has the greater power.
 You think now you felt brush strokes or
 the space between them, a motion
 bearing down on you—accumulation
 of stars, each night of them
 arranging over the roofs of entire cities.
  
 His careful strokes whiten the web,
 the swirl of woodgrain blotted
 out like a breath stopped
 at the heart. Nothing has changed
 you say, faithlessly. But something has
 cleansed you past recognition. When
 you stand near his ladder looking up
 he does not acknowledge you,
 and as from daylight in a dream you see
 your house has passed from you
 into the blessed hands of others.
  
 This is ownership, you think, arriving
 in the heady afterlife of paint smell.
 A deep opening goes on in you.
 Some paint has dropped onto your shoulder
 as though light concealed an unsuspected
 weight. You think it has fallen through
 you. You think you have agreed to this,
 what has been done with your life, willingly.

I tried to cut through
                             all our hurried centuries,
                                                         lost in a forest within.
  
  
 Men
                             broke by war
                                                         emerged in frightful shape—
  
  
 more than human
                             but also less,
                                                         they were quite aware,
  
  
 the sovereign dead,
                             that time is like a window
                                                         opening up the sad patterns of never.
  
  
 As one they advanced—
                             Lloyd George
                                                         Georges Clemenceau
  
  
 Adolph Hitler
                             —through history.
                                                         But the past does not follow
  
  
 so straightforward a path
                             said I
                                                         (predictably in Italian),
  
  
 and, burning
                             under their masters,
                                                         they proclaimed
  
  
 the world a pendulum.
                             It is possible,
                                                         but this gives rise
  
  
 to the often-heard complaint
                             that repetition is unavoidable.
                                                         Still time issues into today,
  
  
 little fathers.
                             The years, I believe,
                                                         can be shaped with one’s hands.
  
  
 The world
                             —its obscure moving fields,
                                                         Persian tragedies,
  
  
 and countries in peace—
                             I had to inform 
                                                         that council of the lost,
  
  
 remains an instrument,
                             a valve instrument,
                                                         which, when waning,
  
  
 is perfectly clear in the pit
                             —and, being given
                                                         to such classical concepts
  
  
 as freedom and necessity,
                             laboriously continued
                                                         in the traditional way—
  
  
 I believe     I believe.

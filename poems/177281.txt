title : Much in Little

text : 
Amid the iris and the rose, 
The honeysuckle and the bay, 
The wild earth for a moment goes 
In dust or weed another way. 

Small though its corner be, the weed 
Will yet intrude its creeping beard; 
The harsh blade and the hairy seed 
Recall the brutal earth we feared. 

And if no water touch the dust 
In some far corner, and one dare 
To breathe upon it, one may trust 
The spectre on the summer air: 

The risen dust alive with fire, 
The fire made visible, a blur 
Interrate, the pervasive ire 
Of foxtail and of hoarhound burr.

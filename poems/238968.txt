They walk past you
                                        weeping
                              for the leaves that burnt
                              & fell, the wood exposed
                              like bone, sculpture
                    that suddenly emerges
                    from white haze.
You old fortune-teller,
you could have told them
in their vibrant grief
whispering through the night wind
your breath held in your heart
like the trembling promise of tomorrow,
just before dawn
                    there was no pain
                             you are the wood
                                       not the leaf,
                                                 falling is not
                                                           falling but
                                                                     offering.

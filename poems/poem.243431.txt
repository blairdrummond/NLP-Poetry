Metaphor, Rhymed Stanza

Not for that city of the level sun,
     Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze--
     The shadeless, sleepless city of white days,
White nights, or nights and days that are as one--
We weary, when all is said , all thought, all done.
     We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see
     What, from the threshold of eternity
We shall step into. No, I think we shun
The splendour of that everlasting glare,
   The clamour of that never-ending song.
   And if for anything we greatly long,
It is for some remote and quiet stair
     Which winds to silence and a space for sleep
     Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep.

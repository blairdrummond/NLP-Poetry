author : June Jordan

text : 
Dedicated to the 600,000 Palestinian men, women, and children who lived in Lebanon from 1948-1983.
I didn’t know and nobody told me and what   
could I do or say, anyway? 

They said you shot the London Ambassador   
and when that wasn’t true   
they said so 
what 
They said you shelled their northern villages 
and when U.N. forces reported that was not true 
because your side of the cease-fire was holding 
since more than a year before 
they said so 
what 
They said they wanted simply to carve 
a 25 mile buffer zone and then 
they ravaged your 
water supplies your electricity your 
hospitals your schools your highways and byways all 
the way north to Beirut because they said this 
was their quest for peace 
They blew up your homes and demolished the grocery 
stores and blocked the Red Cross and took away doctors 
to jail and they cluster-bombed girls and boys 
whose bodies 
swelled purple and black into twice the original size 
and tore the buttocks from a four month old baby 
and then 
they said this was brilliant 
military accomplishment and this was done 
they said in the name of self-defense they said 
that is the noblest concept 
of mankind isn’t that obvious? 
They said something about never again and then 
they made close to one million human beings homeless 
in less than three weeks and they killed or maimed 
40,000 of your men and your women and your children 

But I didn’t know and nobody told me and what 
could I do or say, anyway? 

They said they were victims. They said you were 
Arabs. 
They called      your apartments and gardens      guerrilla 
strongholds. 
They called      the screaming devastation   
that they created       the rubble.   
Then they told you to leave, didn’t they? 

Didn’t you read the leaflets that they dropped   
from their hotshot fighter jets?   
They told you to go.   
One hundred and thirty-five thousand   
Palestinians in Beirut and why   
didn’t you take the hint?   
Go!   
There was the Mediterranean: You   
could walk into the water and stay   
there.   
What was the problem? 

I didn’t know and nobody told me and what   
could I do or say, anyway? 

Yes, I did know it was the money I earned as a poet that   
paid   
for the bombs and the planes and the tanks   
that they used to massacre your family 

But I am not an evil person   
The people of my country aren't so bad 

You can expect but so much   
from those of us who have to pay taxes and watch   
American TV 

You see my point; 

I’m sorry.   
I really am sorry.

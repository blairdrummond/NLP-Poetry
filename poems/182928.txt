title : In Memoriam Mae Noblitt

text : 
This is just a place: 
we go around, distanced, 
yearly in a star’s 

atmosphere, turning 
daily into and out of 
direct light and 

slanting through the 
quadrant seasons: deep 
space begins at our 

heels, nearly rousing 
us loose: we look up 
or out so high, sight’s   

silk almost draws us away: 
this is just a place: 
currents worry themselves 

coiled and free in airs 
and oceans: water picks 
up mineral shadow and 

plasm into billions of 
designs, frames: trees, 
grains, bacteria: but 

is love a reality we 
made here ourselves— 
and grief—did we design 

that—or do these, 
like currents, whine 
in and out among us merely 

as we arrive and go: 
this is just a place: 
the reality we agree with, 

that agrees with us, 
outbounding this, arrives 
to touch, joining with 

us from far away: 
our home which defines 
us is elsewhere but not 

so far away we have   
forgotten it: 
this is just a place.

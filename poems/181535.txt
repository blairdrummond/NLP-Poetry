title : Beggar’s Song

author : Gregory Orr

text : 
Here’s a seed. Food 
for a week. Cow skull 
in the pasture; back room 
where the brain was: 
spacious hut for me. 

Small then, and smaller. 
My desire’s to stay alive 
and be no larger 
than a sliver 
lodged in my own heart. 

And if the heart’s a rock 
I’ll whack it with this tin 
cup and eat the sparks, 
always screaming, always 
screaming for more.

Publication - is the Auction 
Of the Mind of Man - 
Poverty - be justifying 
For so foul a thing 

Possibly - but We - would rather 
From Our Garret go 
White - unto the White Creator - 
Than invest - Our Snow - 

Thought belong to Him who gave it - 
Then - to Him Who bear 
It's Corporeal illustration - sell 
The Royal Air - 

In the Parcel - Be the Merchant 
Of the Heavenly Grace - 
But reduce no Human Spirit 
To Disgrace of Price -

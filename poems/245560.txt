title : This Is the Time of Grasshoppers and All That I See Is Dying

Colleen,
 this is the time of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my virulent love for you.
  
 The Cowturdville Star-Times,
 which usually has a typo
 in every damn column,
 says the grasshoppers this year
 “are as big as Buicks” and
 that’s not bad, but then we
 get two eight-point pages
 of who had dinner with whom
 at the bowling alley café and
 who went shopping at Target
 in Rapid City and thus the high
 church of Adrian the Obscure is sacked.
  
 Even my old Dylan tapes are fading,
 becoming near-comic antiques.
 The grasshoppers are destroying
 our yard and they’re as big as
 my middle finger saluting God.
 The grass is yellow. The trees
 look like Agent Orange has hit
 but it’s only the jaw-work of those
 drab armored insects who dance
 in profusion and pure destruction.
  
 Sweet woman, dear love of my life,
 when you’re not angry and sputtering
 at everything and everyone, you
 become so childlike, so pure.
 Your voice seems to have grown
 higher recently, almost a little-girl pitch.
  
 Today, like most days, I have you
 home for your two-hour reprieve
 from the nursing home prison.
 We’re sitting at the picnic table in
 the backyard staring at the defoliation
 of lilacs, brain matter, and honeysuckle.
 You’re eating a Hershey Bar and
 a crystal glob of snot is hanging
 from your nose.
 I reach over, pinch it off,
 and wipe it on my jeans.
 You thrust the last bite
 of chocolate into my mouth
 as a demented grasshopper
 jumps onto your ear.
 You scream. I howl
 with laughter until you do too.
 Happiness comes with a price.
  
 This is the times of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my swarming love for you.
  
 Last night on PBS some
 lesioned guy being screwed to death
 by legions of viral invisibility
 blurted the great cliché of regret:
 I wish I could be twenty
 again and know what
 I know now … 
  
 My own regrets are equally foolish.
 And, I wonder, how the hell
 is it I’ve reached a place
 where I’d give what’s left
 of my allotment of sunsets
 and frozen dinners
 for some unholy replay
 of just one hour in some nearly
 forgotten time and place?
  
 Darling,
 in the baked soil of the far west,
 I first saw the ant lions, those
 hairy little bugs who dug funnel
 traps for ants in the dry earth.
 At twelve, looking over the edge
 of one such funnel surrounded by
 a circle of tiny stones in the sand,
 I aimed a beam of white light
 from my magnifying glass
 and found I could re-create
 a hell of my own accord.
  
 Poverty and boredom
 made me cruel early on.
 The next summer while digging
 postholes I found a cache of
 those grotesque yellow bugs
 we called Children of the Earth
 so I piled matches atop them
 and barbecued their ugliness.
 I was at war with insects.
  
 In my fifteenth summer I got
 covered with ticks in the sagebrush
 and that fall I nervously lost my cherry
 in a cathouse called the Green Front
 and got cursed with crabs but that’s
 not what I want to sing about
 at all… come on now.
 This is no bug progression.
 This ain’t no insect sonata.
  
 This is only misdirection,
 a sleight of hand upon the keys
 and the unholy replay of just
 one hour in some nearly
 forgotten time and place
 that I’d like to return to
 will remain myth or maybe
 a holy, tumescent mystery.
  
 And let’s not call
 these bloodwords
 POETRY or a winter count
 of desperate dreams
 when reality is much simpler.
  
 Colleen,
 I swear to Christ
 this is the time of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my sparkling love for you.

Language must suffice. 

Years ago, 
               under a sweet June sky 
stung with stars and swept back by black leaves   
barely rustling, 

a beautiful woman nearly killed me. 

Listen, 
she said, 
and turned 
her lovely face to the stars, the wild sky.... 


2. 

No. 

No: years ago, 

                     under a sweet, June sky 
strung with stars and swept back by black leaves   
barely rustling, 

under this sky 
broad, bright, all rung around 

with rustling elders—or intoxicating willows,   
or oaks, I forget— 
                           under this sky, 

a beautiful woman killed me, nearly.   

I say beautiful. You had to see her. 

Listen, 
she said, 

and turned a lovely shell of her ear 
to the swirl of stars 
and the moon 
                  smudged as a wingtip in one tree, not far. 


3. 

Yes: she scraped my back bloody against a rough trunk.   
Yes: she flung back her lovely face 
and her hair, holding me down, 

and the tree shook slowly, as in a mild, persistent laugh   
or wind, 

            and the moon high in that black tree   
swung to and fro ... 

there were millions of stars   
up where she stared past us,   
and one moon, I think. 


4. 

Excuse me. 

My friend, who loves poetry truly, says too much   
nature taints my work. 

Yes. Yes. Yes. 
Too many birds, stars— 
                                 too much rain, 
                                 too much grass— 
so many wild, bowing limbs 
howling or groaning into the natural night ... 

and he might be right. Even here. 

That is, if tree were a tree. 
That is, if star or moon or even beautiful woman 
craning the shell of her ear 
were what they were. 

They are, I think, not. 

No: and a poem about nature contains anything but. 


5. 

When they descended to us, they were a cloud of stars 
sweeping lightly. They sang to us urgently 
about our lives, 

they touched us 
with a hundred thousand hair-soft, small legs— 

and held down by such hungers, we let them cover us,   
this beautiful woman, this me, 

who couldn’t move, 
who were stung—do you hear?— 
who were stung again, were covered that quickly, crying   
to each other 
                     to fly away! 


6. 
          ... I just can’t erase 
the exquisite, weeping language 
of the wasps, nor her face in starlight 
and so tranquil under that false, papery, bobbing 
          moon 
just minutes before, 
saying listen, 

listen, 

nor then the weight 
of her whole natural body 
                                       pinning down mine 
until we both cried out for fear, and pain,   
and still couldn’t move. 


7. 

Language must suffice. 
First, it doesn’t. Then, of course, 

it does. Listen, listen. 

What do you hear? This nearly killed me. 
I’ll never know 
why she didn’t just whisper Here they come, warn Move! 
cry They’ll kill us! 
Yes: I will save you ... 
Yes: I love you too much to watch you suffer! 
But it’s all I recall, or now need. 

And, anyway, I loved her, she was so beautiful.   
And that is what I have had to say 
before it’s too late, 
                               before they have killed me,   
before they have killed you, too, 

or before we have all become something else entirely, 

which is to say   
before we are   
only language.

title : Versus

author : Catherine Wagner

text : 
In this poem all artifice
is stripped away
but you are held under water.

In this poem you enter a mirrored dressing room
lit so that you look more beautiful than you have ever looked.

I recognize you with surprise.
In this poem you are by yourself.

Confessional

The woman is perfected.   
Her dead 

Body wears the smile of accomplishment,   
The illusion of a Greek necessity 

Flows in the scrolls of her toga,   
Her bare 

Feet seem to be saying: 
We have come so far, it is over. 

Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,   
One at each little 

Pitcher of milk, now empty.   
She has folded 

Them back into her body as petals   
Of a rose close when the garden 

Stiffens and odors bleed 
From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower. 

The moon has nothing to be sad about,   
Staring from her hood of bone. 

She is used to this sort of thing. 
Her blacks crackle and drag.

Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

A long time have I known you... Why,
 Full eighteen years, I must confess!
 All pink are you; pale, blear am I.
 Winters, mine; yours, spring's comeliness!
  
 White cemetery lilacs sprout
 Over my temples; but soon, now,
 The grove entire will bloom about
 My head, to shade my withered brow.
  
 Pallid, my sun sinks low, and will
 Soon fade on the horizon's face;
 And on the mournful, doleful hill
 I see my final dwelling-place.
  
 Oh! May you from your lips let fall
 A kiss, too long delayed, upon
 My own, so that beneath my pall
 I may rest, heart at peace, anon...

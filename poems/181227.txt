title : Digging in a Footlocker

Crouched before dismantled guns, 
we found war souvenirs 
our uncle padlocked in the attic, 
a brittle latch easily pried off. 

Stiff uniforms on top, snapshots 
of soldiers young as our cousins, 
a velvet box of medals 
as if he fought all battles 

in World War II. Bayonets, machetes, 
a folded flag, two hand grenades 
with missing pins. We picked up teeth 
like pennies, loose, as if tossed in, 

a piece of something dark and waxy 
like a fig, curved like a question mark, 
a human ear. We touched dried pieces 
of cloth stuck to curved bones 

and held them to the light, 
turning them over and over, wondering 
how did uncles learn to kill, 
what would happen when we grew up.

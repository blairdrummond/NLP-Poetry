title : Securitization

text : 
In someone’s distant algorithm   
your mortgage was bundled to another’s   
—hedged—   
and stamped a new “security.”   
While it was swapped   
from investor to investor   
accruing fees and interest at each turn,   
your shadow   
partner   
defaulted   
and she abandoned her home.   

Someone uses your mortgage   
to leverage   
something   
far inside the starbursts of a server.   
Likewise marriage   
has   
no image—   
What’s a mortgage   
and who’s   
it engage   
on the other side of the firewall?   

*   

I witnessed a will   
which—the language invested with law   
godmothers the peacock’s   
fanned   
screech—   
would take care of the baby in the event of a   
[blesses herself] 

It lives at the Cathedral   
and seems to be some kind of   
mascot for   
Baptisms   

*   

Securities:   

The future art you’ll make and its pleasure   
is hedged against the   
boys who died   

you fancied.

title : The White Train

author : John Spaulding

text : 
The white train emerges from a dark curtain
 of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow.
 The white train appears as though newly escaped
 from the jaws of night. The white train steams
 out of the forest into the clear white
 meadow, melting the fresh snow around it.
  
 The trees are towering. Ancient giants.
 A whole section seems to have been logged.
 Over there the folded arms of soldiers who
 gather in small groups. We cannot see
 leaders or individual faces. Horsemen far away.
 On their way to the revolution perhaps.
  
 In the dining car, behind the velvet curtains—
 blood puddings and sea pie, clear soups
 and small marrow. Already today
 the chef has cooked three luncheons
 while crossing Poland; the starched
 waiters managed without spilling a drop.
  
 Dozens of dirty white napkins heap on hampers
 like miniature Alps threatening to fall. But
 now the train has braked and stopped. Small boys
 fog the windows with their warm breath
 as they watch the soldiers with silver sabers who
 order everyone off the train, into the new snow.

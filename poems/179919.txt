title : We Eat Out Together

author : Bernadette Mayer

text : 
My heart is a fancy place 
Where giant reddish-purple cauliflowers 
& white ones in French & English are outside 
Waiting to welcome you to a boat 
Over the low black river for a big dinner 
There's alot of choice among the foods 
Even a tortured lamb served in pieces 
En croute on a plate so hot as a rack 
Of clouds blown over the cold filthy river 
We are entitled to see anytime while we 
Use the tablecovers to love each other 
Publicly dishing out imitative luxuries 
To show off poetry's extreme generosity 
Then home in the heart of a big limousine

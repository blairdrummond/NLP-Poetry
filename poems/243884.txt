title : I Don't Miss It

author : Tracy K. Smith

text : 
But sometimes I forget where I am,
 Imagine myself inside that life again.
  
 Recalcitrant mornings. Sun perhaps, 
 Or more likely colorless light
  
 Filtering its way through shapeless cloud.
  
 And when I begin to believe I haven’t left,
 The rest comes back. Our couch. My smoke
  
 Climbing the walls while the hours fall.
 Straining against the noise of traffic, music,
  
 Anything alive, to catch your key in the door.
 And that scamper of feeling in my chest,
  
 As if the day, the night, wherever it is
 I am by then, has been only a whir
  
 Of something other than waiting.
  
 We hear so much about what love feels like.
 Right now, today, with the rain outside,
  
 And leaves that want as much as I do to believe
 In May, in seasons that come when called,
  
 It’s impossible not to want
 To walk into the next room and let you
  
 Run your hands down the sides of my legs,
 Knowing perfectly well what they know.

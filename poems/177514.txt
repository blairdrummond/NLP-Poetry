text : 
In the longer view it doesn’t matter. 
However, it’s that having lived, it matters. 
So that every death breaks you apart. 
You find yourself weeping at the door 
of your own kitchen, overwhelmed 
by loss. And you find yourself weeping 
as you pass the homeless person
head in hands resigned on a cement
step, the wire basket on wheels right there. 
Like stopped film, or a line of Vallejo, 
or a sketch of the mechanics of a wing 
by Leonardo. All pauses in space, 
a violent compression of meaning 
in an instant within the meaningless. 
Even staring into the dim shapes 
at the farthest edge; accepting that blur.

The huge doll of my body   
refuses to rise. 
I am the toy of women.   
My mother 

would prop me up for her friends.   
“Talk, talk,” she would beg. 
I moved my mouth 
but words did not come. 

My wife took me down from the shelf.   
I lay in her arms. “We suffer 
the sickness of self,” she would whisper.   
And I lay there dumb. 

Now my daughter 
gives me a plastic nurser 
filled with water. 
“You are my real baby,” she says. 

Poor child! 
I look into the brown   
mirrors of her eyes   
and see myself 

diminishing, sinking down 
to a depth she does not know is there.   
Out of breath, 
I will not rise again. 

I grow into my death. 
My life is small 
and getting smaller. The world is green.   
Nothing is all.

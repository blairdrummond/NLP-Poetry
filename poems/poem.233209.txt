The Plain Sense of Things 
Wallace Stevens 
1879-1955
Modern

Living, The Mind



After the leaves have fallen, we return 
To a plain sense of things. It is as if 
 We had come to an end of the imagination, 
 Inanimate in an inert savoir.

 It is difficult even to choose the adjective 
 For this blank cold, this sadness without cause. 
 The great structure has become a minor house. 
 No turban walks across the lessened floors.

 The greenhouse never so badly needed paint. 
 The chimney is fifty years old and slants to one side. 
 A fantastic effort has failed, a repetition 
 In a repetitiousness of men and flies.

 Yet the absence of the imagination had
 Itself to be imagined. The great pond,
 The plain sense of it, without reflections, leaves,
 Mud, water like dirty glass, expressing silence

 Of a sort, silence of a rat come out to see,
 The great pond and its waste of the lilies, all this
 Had to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge,
 Required, as a necessity requires.

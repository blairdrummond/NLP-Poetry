title : My Little Dreams

author : Georgia Douglas Johnson

text : 
I’m folding up my little dreams
   Within my heart tonight,
And praying I may soon forget
   The torture of their sight.

For time’s deft fingers scroll my brow
   With fell relentless art—
I’m folding up my little dreams
   Tonight, within my heart.

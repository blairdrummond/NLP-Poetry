What say the Bells of San Blas 
To the ships that southward pass 
       From the harbor of Mazatlan? 
To them it is nothing more 
Than the sound of surf on the shore,-- 
       Nothing more to master or man. 

But to me, a dreamer of dreams, 
To whom what is and what seems 
       Are often one and the same,-- 
The Bells of San Blas to me 
Have a strange, wild melody, 
       And are something more than a name. 

For bells are the voice of the church; 
They have tones that touch and search 
       The hearts of young and old; 
One sound to all, yet each 
Lends a meaning to their speech, 
       And the meaning is manifold. 

They are a voice of the Past, 
Of an age that is fading fast, 
       Of a power austere and grand; 
When the flag of Spain unfurled 
Its folds o'er this western world, 
       And the Priest was lord of the land. 

The chapel that once looked down 
On the little seaport town 
       Has crumbled into the dust; 
And on oaken beams below 
The bells swing to and fro, 
       And are green with mould and rust. 

"Is, then, the old faith dead," 
They say, "and in its stead 
       Is some new faith proclaimed, 
That we are forced to remain 
Naked to sun and rain, 
       Unsheltered and ashamed? 

"Once in our tower aloof 
We rang over wall and roof 
       Our warnings and our complaints; 
And round about us there 
The white doves filled the air, 
       Like the white souls of the saints. 

"The saints! Ah, have they grown 
Forgetful of their own? 
       Are they asleep, or dead, 
That open to the sky 
Their ruined Missions lie, 
       No longer tenanted? 

"Oh, bring us back once more 
The vanished days of yore, 
       When the world with faith was filled; 
Bring back the fervid zeal, 
The hearts of fire and steel, 
       The hands that believe and build. 

"Then from our tower again 
We will send over land and main 
       Our voices of command, 
Like exiled kings who return 
To their thrones, and the people learn 
       That the Priest is lord of the land!" 

O Bells of San Blas, in vain 
Ye call back the Past again! 
       The Past is deaf to your prayer; 
Out of the shadows of night 
The world rolls into light; 
       It is daybreak everywhere.

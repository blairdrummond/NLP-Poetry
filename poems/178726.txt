What brings me alive 
is less than simplicity, 
is a company of soldiers in shiny blue jackets 
boiling chickens in the shade          
by the Erasmus Gate, is the fact that my grandfather 
died begging for mercy 
in a hotel in Atlanta, and that my grandmother, in 1910, 
mourned because her breasts   
were small. 

I know four men 
who paddled the length of the Mississippi 
in a dugout they hacked 
and burned out of a beech tree. When anyone mentioned rivers 
they would look at each other 
and their eyes would soften with the memory 
of mists and sand bars, 
of the grave black brows of river barges.   

I come from a country as large as Brazil,   
but all I remember 
are the wet silver webs 
of golden jungle spiders 
netted in the cane. 

I wake up thinking of my brother,   
who, on a July morning in 1954,   
killed a boy without meaning to.   
And I can tell you that this isn’t true,   
that my brother didn’t, 
as he swept back a four iron 
on the lawn of our house in Sea Island,   
crack the temple of a boy we had only met   
the night before. I can say Yes 
I am lying again, 
about the boy, about Sea Island, 
but as you get up to fix another drink   
I will tell you a story 
about sleeping in a hay barn in Turkey 
and of waking in the night, as, one by one,   
the farm hands stood out of the rank straw   
to greet us. 
                   I want you to know 
that my life is a ritual lie 
and that I deserve to be loved 
anyway. I want you to smile 
when I tell of the purple hyacinths 
caught in the gears of the raised bridge 
over the Chickopee River, I want you to pretend   
you were there. 

My sister’s hips were two ax handles wide,   
she wept that no one would love her, 
my sister, who waded among yellow poppies 
and wondered if she were really alive—I want you to wish   
you had married her, 
I want you to say Please, why did she leave me,   
Get her back, O my God, 
how can I live without her. I’m not even amazed   
that I want you to say this. Listen, 
I came downstairs this morning 
and somebody had filled the house with flowers.

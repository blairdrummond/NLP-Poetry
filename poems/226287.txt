title : Sire

Here comes the shadow not looking where it is going,   
And the whole night will fall; it is time. 
Here comes the little wind which the hour 
Drags with it everywhere like an empty wagon through leaves.   
Here comes my ignorance shuffling after them 
Asking them what they are doing. 

Standing still, I can hear my footsteps   
Come up behind me and go on 
Ahead of me and come up behind me and 
With different keys clinking in the pockets, 
And still I do not move. Here comes 
The white-haired thistle seed stumbling past through the branches   
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man. 
I believe it is the lost wisdom of my grandfather 
Whose ways were his own and who died before I could ask. 

Forerunner, I would like to say, silent pilot,   
Little dry death, future, 
Your indirections are as strange to me 
As my own. I know so little that anything   
You might tell me would be a revelation. 

Sir, I would like to say, 
It is hard to think of the good woman   
Presenting you with children, like cakes,   
Granting you the eye of her needle,   
Standing in doorways, flinging after you   
Little endearments, like rocks, or her silence   
Like a whole Sunday of bells. Instead, tell me:   
Which of my many incomprehensions 
Did you bequeath me, and where did they take you? Standing 
In the shoes of indecision, I hear them   
Come up behind me and go on ahead of me 
Wearing boots, on crutches, barefoot, they could never 
Get together on any door-sill or destination— 
The one with the assortment of smiles, the one   
Jailed in himself like a forest, the one who comes 
Back at evening drunk with despair and turns 
Into the wrong night as though he owned it—oh small 
Deaf disappearance in the dusk, in which of their shoes 
Will I find myself tomorrow?

title : The Old Man Drew the Line

author : Carl Rakosi

text : 
The old man 
                  drew the line 
for his son, 
                  the executive: 
“I don’t want you spending money on me! 
(not as long as there are fathers)”, 
the line ageless 
                         as the independence of time.   
Musters tears 
                     and overflows 
the inner ear, 
                     yet does not matter. 
It can not cure frailty. 

I seek him 
                who will seek me out   
and will believe 
                         what I do not believe 
(that is my frailty). 
                                 “Sit down here with us,” 
he says, 
            “You don’t have to impress anyone.   
Here is my hand. 
                         Your age is of no significance.” 
Ah! 
      I move closer to his mouth   
and look into his eyes. 
                                    I do not avert mine, 
there is no reason to, 
                                  or retreat   
into a kindly smile. 


Ah, companero, 
                      you were born 
on the wrong day 
                         when God was paradoxical.   
You’ll have to 
                      find yourself an old dog.

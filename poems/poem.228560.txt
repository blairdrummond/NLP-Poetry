Rhymed Stanza

   Like the ghost of a dear friend dead
          Is Time long past.
A tone which is now forever fled,
A hope which is now forever past,
A love so sweet it could not last,
          Was Time long past.

   There were sweet dreams in the night
          Of Time long past:
And, was it sadness or delight,
Each day a shadow onward cast
Which made us wish it yet might last?
          That Time long past.

   There is regret, almost remorse,
          For Time long past.
'Tis like a child's beloved corse
A father watches, till at last
Beauty is like remembrance, cast
          From Time long past.

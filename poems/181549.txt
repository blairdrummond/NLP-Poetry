title : Getting a Word In

author : James Galvin

text : 
Very sad, 
Having to 
Come out of nowhere, 

The rain 
We’ve been waiting for 
Is waiting too. 

Trees, 
By now, 
Have had enough daylight. 

They’d like, 
Please, 
To sleep it off. 

If nothing 
Else, nothing 
Else. 

Behind our backs 
Things mean themselves. 
Violins crack 

From wanting to exist. 
It’s hard, getting a word in. 
I’m waiting 

To arrive inside my clothes, 
If nothing else, 
Willing 

To be (having to 
Come out of nowhere) 
Very sad.

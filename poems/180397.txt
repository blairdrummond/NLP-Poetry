title : Astrophil and Stella 21

author : Sir Philip Sidney

text : 
Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame 
My young mind marred, whom Love doth windlass so, 
That mine own writings like bad servants show 
My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame, 
That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame 
Such coltish gyres, that to my birth I owe 
Nobler desires, least else that friendly foe, 
Great expectation, wear a train of shame. 
For since mad March great promise made of me, 
If now the May of my years much decline, 
What can be hoped my harvest time will be? 
Sure you say well, your wisdom’s golden mine 
Dig deep with learning’s spade, now tell me this, 
Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is?

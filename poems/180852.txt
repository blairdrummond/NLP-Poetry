title : "I saw my Lady weep"

I saw my Lady weep,
And Sorrow proud to be advanced so
In those fair eyes, where all perfections keep;
    Her face was full of woe,
But such a woe (believe me) as wins more hearts
Than mirth can do, with her enticing parts.

Sorrow was there made fair,
And Passion, wise; Tears, a delightful thing;
Silence, beyond all speech, a wisdom rare;
    She made her sighs to sing,
And all things with so sweet a sadness move;
As made my heart both grieve and love.

O Fairer than aught else
The world can shew, leave off, in time, to grieve,
Enough, enough! Your joyful look excels;
    Tears kill the heart, believe, 
O strive not to be excellent in woe,
Which only breeds your beauty’s overthrow.

One night in April or May, 
his daughter saw someone's hand 
make the curtain which was drawn tightly across her window bulge 
and ran to the adjoining room in her night clothes 
where he and his son were sitting. 
He ran around the house one way 
and his son ran the other way 
and they found a Negro 
under a workbench 
within six or eight feet of the window 
holding a piece of plank before his face— 
begging them not to shoot.

The Negro was dead 
when the doctors examined him. 
They found upon his belly   
bruises: 
he died, the doctor said, of peritonitis. 

The jailer testified that the Negro had been brought to the jail 
charged with burglary; 
but no warrant for his arrest was produced 
and the jailer did not know—or tell— 
who brought him. 
The Negro said that a crowd of men 
had taken him from a store to the woods 
and whipped him 
with "a buggy trace." 

He was not treated by a doctor, the jailer, or anybody: 
just put into the jail and left there to die. 
The doctor who saw him first—on a Monday— 
did nothing for him 
and said that he would not die of a his beating; 
but he did die of it on Wednesday.

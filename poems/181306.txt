title : The Trees Delete Themselves Inside a Fog-Sphere

author : Francis Ponge

text : 
In the fog which surrounds the trees, the leaves are strippedâ€”leaves defaced already by slow oxidation, deadened by the sap's out-seeping for flowers' and fruits' gain, since the harsh heats of August made of them a less. 

In the bark, vertical furrows crease and slit where dampness drains to the earth's base, indifferent to the living citizens of the trunk. 

Flowers scattered, fruit conferred. Since youth, this relinquishing of breathing attributes and body parts has become for the trees a standard practice.

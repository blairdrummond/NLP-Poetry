title : A Red Tricycle in the Belly of the Pool

author : Karyna McGlynn

text : 
the live oak over the nursery got a disease
 they could only save one limb
 it wasn’t surprising; it wasn’t that kind of nursery
  
 a girl rode her red tricycle around the bottom of the pool
 the pool had no water; it hadn’t rained
  
 the girl kept smelling her hand
 it smelled like honeywheat, or the inside of a girl’s panties
  
 someone said, race you
 she nodded okay and pedaled like hell
 after three laps no one had passed her
  
 she looked over her shoulder, lost her balance
 ripped her hands & knees on the blue concrete
  
 the one limb on the live oak curved like a question
 would she need stitches again
  
 there was already ink under her skin & iodine on her tongue
 or was it the other way around
  
 she could see black thread bunching
 sewing centipedes under her skin
  
 her throat burned and she couldn’t move her legs
 it wasn’t a tricycle
 it was something she couldn’t get her foot out from under
  
 she hated to stop or lose her shoe and, I’m sorry
 the pool was full of water

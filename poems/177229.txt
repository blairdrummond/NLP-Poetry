title : Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy’s Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota

text : 
Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly,   
Asleep on the black trunk, 
Blowing like a leaf in green shadow.   
Down the ravine behind the empty house,   
The cowbells follow one another   
Into the distances of the afternoon.   
To my right, 
In a field of sunlight between two pines,   
The droppings of last year’s horses   
Blaze up into golden stones. 
I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on.   
A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home. 
I have wasted my life.

title : Middle Age

author : Jason Shinder

text : 
Many of my friends are alone
 and know too much to be happy
 though they still want to dive
 to the bottom of the green ocean
 and bring back a gold coin
 in their hand. A woman I know wakes
 in the late evening and talks
 to her late husband,
 the windows blank photographs.
 On the porch, my brother,
 hands in pockets,
 stares at the flowing stream.
 Whatâ€™s wrong? Nothing.
 The cows stand
 in their own slow afternoons.
 The horses gather
 wild rose hips in the sun
 the way I longed for someone
 long ago. What was it like?
 The door opening
 and no one on either side.

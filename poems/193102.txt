text : 
Now that I have cooled to you 
Let there be gold of tarnished masonry, 
Temples soothed by the sun to ruin    
That sleep utterly. 
Give me hand for the dances,             
Ripples at Philae, in and out,          
And lips, my Lesbian,          
Wall flowers that once were flame.          

Your hair is my Carthage          
And my arms the bow,          
And our words arrows          
To shoot the stars          
Who from that misty sea          
Swarm to destroy us.          

But you there beside me—          
Oh how shall I defy you,          
Who wound me in the night          
With breasts shining          
Like Venus and like Mars?          
The night that is shouting Jason          
When the loud eaves rattle          
As with waves above me          
Blue at the prow of my desire.

    The Dying Words of Goethe
"Light! more light! the shadows deepen,
         And my life is ebbing low,
 Throw the windows widely open:
         Light! more light! before I go.
  
 "Softly let the balmy sunshine
         Play around my dying bed,
 E'er the dimly lighted valley
         I with lonely feet must tread.
  
 "Light! more light! for Death is weaving
         Shadows 'round my waning sight,
 And I fain would gaze upon him
         Through a stream of earthly light."
  
 Not for greater gifts of genius;
         Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
 All the dying poet whispers
         Is a prayer for light, more light.
  
 Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
         Fading slowly from his sight;
 All the poet's aspirations
         Centre in that prayer for light.
  
 Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams
         Melt and vanish from the sight,
 May our dim and longing vision
         Then be blessed with light, more light.

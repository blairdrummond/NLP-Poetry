title : Song at Drumholm

author : John Unterecker

text : 
My liveliest self, I give you fair leave
 in these windblown weathers,
 heather-hearted and human and strange,
 to turn every blackberry corner
 of yesterday’s summer.
  
 The robin, singing her love-me-forever,
 kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather
 blues, sings tide flow
 and autumn’s turning and white
 winds folding.
  
 Cattle along all hedges wind winter
 into their frosty
 breathing, their slow eyes dreaming
 barn, bullock, and fodder
 under all hedges.
  
 But sea cave and sycamore tell us the world
 is wider than weather.
 Blackberries darken the corners
 I turn, and gold seas turning
 darken, darken.
  
 My liveliest self, my other, Godspeed
 on our farings.
 The bronze path at evening.            Toward summer,
 then.                        My hand, your hand—
 as if first meeting.

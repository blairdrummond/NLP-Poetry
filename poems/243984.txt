title : Self Portrait as a Meadow

author : Linda Norton

text : 
There is a chair
the heart of which
is wooden
split five ways
and grass pressed flat
where we kissed
where others later kissed
on the same mattress
and solemn nothing
happening under a canopy—
 
Have you forgotten me?
 
I will go down wonderfully
as was told in proverbs
though for a long time I thought
I should not go.
 
Here are things that have
no Latin names
or none
that men would know.

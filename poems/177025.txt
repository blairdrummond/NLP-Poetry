title : The Mailman

author : Franz Wright

text : 
From the third floor window 
you watch the mailman’s slow progress   
through the blowing snow. 
As he goes from door to door 

he might be searching   
for a room to rent,   
unsure of the address, 
which he keeps stopping to check 

in the outdated and now 
obliterated clipping 
he holds, between thickly gloved fingers,   
close to his eyes 

in a hunched and abruptly   
simian posture 
that makes you turn away,   
quickly switching off the lamp.

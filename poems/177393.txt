text : 
I’m all alone in this world, she said,   
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed,   
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand— 
The truth of the matter’s 
I ain’t got no man. 

Big Boy opened his mouth and said,   
Trouble with you is 
You ain’t got no head! 
If you had a head and used your mind   
You could have me with you 
All the time. 

She answered, Babe, what must I do? 

He said, Share your bed— 
And your money, too.

title : Lunchbox Love Note

author : Kenn Nesbitt

text : 
Inside my lunch 
to my surprise 
a perfect heart-shaped 
love note lies. 

The outside says, 
“Will you be mine?” 
and, “Will you be 
my valentine?” 

I take it out 
and wonder who 
would want to tell me 
“I love you.” 

Perhaps a girl 
who’s much too shy 
to hand it to me 
eye to eye. 

Or maybe it 
was sweetly penned 
in private by 
a secret friend 

Who found my lunchbox 
sitting by 
and slid the note in 
on the sly. 

Oh, I’d be thrilled 
if it were Jo, 
the cute one in 
the second row. 

Or could it be 
from Jennifer? 
Has she found out 
I’m sweet on her? 

My mind’s abuzz, 
my shoulders tense. 
I need no more 
of this suspense. 

My stomach lurching 
in my throat, 
I open up 
my little note. 

Then wham! as if 
it were a bomb, 
inside it reads, 
“I love you—Mom.”

St. Patrick's Day
Rhymed Stanza

There's an Isle, a green Isle, set in the sea,
     Here's to the Saint that blessed it!
And here's to the billows wild and free
     That for centuries have caressed it!

Here's to the day when the men that roam
     Send longing eyes o'er the water!
Here's to the land that still spells home
     To each loyal son and daughter!

Here's to old Ireland--fair, I ween,
     With the blue skies stretched above her!
Here's to her shamrock warm and green,
     And here's to the hearts that love her!

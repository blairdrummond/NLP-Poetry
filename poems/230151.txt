text : 
A merchant is 
probing for us 
with his chintz curtain 
                                          effect. 

                     * 

“Ha, ha, you missed me,”   
a dead person says. 

                     * 

There’s the bank’s 
colonial balcony 
where no one has 
                                 ever stood.

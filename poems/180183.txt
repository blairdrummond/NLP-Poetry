title : Against Which

author : Michael Ryan

text : 
habit smacks 
its dull skull 
like a stuck bull 
in a brick stall 

and my version 
of what I know 
is like eye surgery 
with a backhoe 

on grace 
so much beyond 
my pitiful gray 
sponge of a brain 

I'd not believe it exists 
except for such 
doses of felicity 
as this.

title : Love Poem for an Enemy

author : Richard Katrovas

text : 
I, as sinned against as sinning, 
take small pleasure from the winning 
of our decades-long guerrilla war. 
For from my job I've wanted more 
than victory over one who'd tried 
to punish me before he died, 
and now, neither of us dead, 
we haunt these halls in constant dread 
of drifting past the other's life 
while long-term memory is rife 
with slights that sting like paper cuts. 
We've occupied our separate ruts 
yet simmered in a single rage. 
We've grown absurd in middle age 
together, and should seek wisdom now 
together, by ending this row. 
I therefore decommission you 
as constant flagship of my rue. 
Below the threshold of my hate 
you now my good regard may rate. 
For I have let my anger pass. 
But, while you're down there, kiss my ass.

title : In Late August

author : Peter Campion

text : 
In a culvert by the airport 
under crumbling slag 
wine colored water seeps 
to this pool the two does 
drink from: each sipping as 
the other keeps look out. 
The skyline is a blur 
of  barcode and microchip. 
Even at home we hold 
the narrowest purchase. 
No arcs of tracer fire. 
No caravans of fleeing 
families. Only this 
suspicion ripples 
through our circles of lamp glow 
(as you sweep the faint sweat 
from your forehead and flip   
another page in your novel) 
this sense that all we own 
is the invisible 
web of our words and touches 
silence and fabulation 
all make believe and real 
as the two does out 
scavenging through rose hips 
and shattered drywall: 
their presence in the space 
around them liveliest 
just before they vanish.

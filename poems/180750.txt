title : The Silver Swan

author : Anonymous

text : 
The silver swan, who living had no note, 
When death approached, unlocked her silent throat; 
Leaning her breast against the reedy shore, 
Thus sung her first and last, and sung no more: 
“Farewell, all joys; Oh death, come close mine eyes; 
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.”

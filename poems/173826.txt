title : Do you Remember me? or are you Proud?

author : Walter Savage Landor

text : 
“Do you remember me? or are you proud?” 
Lightly advancing thro’ her star-trimm’d crowd, 
         Ianthe said, and lookt into my eyes, 
“A yes, a yes, to both: for Memory 
Where you but once have been must ever be, 
         And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.”

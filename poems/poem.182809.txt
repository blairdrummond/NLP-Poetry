Some keep the Sabbath going to Church - 
I keep it, staying at Home - 
With a Bobolink for a Chorister - 
And an Orchard, for a Dome - 

Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice - 
I, just wear my Wings - 
And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church, 
Our little Sexton - sings. 

God preaches, a noted Clergyman - 
And the sermon is never long, 
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last - 
I'm going, all along.

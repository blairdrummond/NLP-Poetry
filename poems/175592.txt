title : Childhood’s Retreat

author : Robert Duncan

text : 
It’s in the perilous boughs of the tree   
out of blue sky    the wind   
sings loudest surrounding me. 

And solitude,   a wild solitude 
’s reveald,   fearfully,   high     I’d climb   
into the shaking uncertainties, 

part out of longing,   part     daring my self, 
part to see that 
widening of the world,   part 

to find my own, my secret 
hiding sense and place, where from afar   
all voices and scenes come back 

—the barking of a dog,   autumnal burnings, 
far calls,   close calls—   the boy I was 
calls out to me 
here the man where I am   “Look! 

I’ve been where you 

most fear to be.”

title : from Step

author : George Albon

text : 
a perfect world
living manifests of
nipple and tip

worked back into
the locus one had
thought delivered

rectangles seep with
the slight growing, to
walk out onto them





a perfect world
the identities
traced above a ground

print as enlarged
location, geographies
of the whorl

the smile that held
no life but an erect
ransom-shadow

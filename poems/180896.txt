title : The Caution

author : Catherine Cockburn

text : 
Soft kisses may be innocent;
But ah! too easy maid, beware;
Tho’ that is all thy kindness meant,
’Tis love’s delusive, fatal snare.

No virgin e’er at first design’d
Thro’ all the maze of love to stray;
But each new path allures her mind,
Till wandering on, she lose her way.

’Tis easy ere set out to stay;
But who the useful art can teach,
When sliding down a steepy way,
To stop, before the end we reach?

Keep ever something in thy power,
Beyond what would thy honour stain:
He will not dare to aim at more,
Who for small favours sighs in vain.

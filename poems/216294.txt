Empty cattle trailers 
               Rumbled dummy thunder 
Down the road all day, and now tonight, 
Heat lightning flashes more of the same fake rain. 
It’s just as well. I couldn’t get to sleep, 
And now it ricochets across the sky 
With empty loads of light. We’ve had a month 
Of drought that tightens dirt around my pond. 
The local wells are dry. But I’ve retired, 
Threw out my wand. I hate this time of year. 
            
               Roux can burn if flour 
               Sticks in skillet butter. 
I’ve been cooking up a storm myself, 
My Daddy’s filé gumbo recipe. 
He used to be a chef on oil rigs 
Until the hurricane. I heard the waves 
That killed him, and I hear them every year. 
It’s emptiness that fills me. That’s my skill. 
I hear the vacant rain before it falls. 
It’s like the murmur of a spiraled shell. 
         
               Hurricane weather, stewing 
               Deep for landfall, spewing 
Rain-a-plenty in the Gulf and here 
In Tennessee they always have a lack 
Of something. Two men called today for wells. 
I told them both to go to hell, and now 
They think I’m sinful, not to use my skill. 
They stand to lose so much, but don’t we all. 
I lost a lot in Hurricane Camille 
And even now can’t hear the end of it. 

               More heat lightning flashes, 
               Absent rain that passes 
Over clouds, and I can make it out, 
Each gurgling current under withered fields, 
Down kitchen drains. The neighbors think I’m crazy, 
Up all hours, but they’ll never know 
The screaming voice inside a breaker’s rage 
Or how it simmers in my ear. I hate 
The sound of water. Give me one good chance 
To make it silent. I’d be right as rain.

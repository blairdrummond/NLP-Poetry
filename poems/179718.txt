title : the trash men

author : Charles Bukowski

text : 
here they come 
these guys 
grey truck 
radio playing 

they are in a hurry 

itâ€™s quite exciting: 
shirt open 
bellies hanging out 

they run out the trash bins 
roll them out to the fork lift 
and then the truck grinds it upward 
with far too much sound . . . 


they had to fill out application forms 
to get these jobs 
they are paying for homes and 
drive late model cars 

they get drunk on Saturday night 

now in the Los Angeles sunshine 
they run back and forth with their trash bins 

all that trash goes somewhere 

and they shout to each other 

then they are all up in the truck 
driving west toward the sea 

none of them know 
that I am alive

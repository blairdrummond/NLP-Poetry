title : Her Monologue of Dark Crepe with Edges of Light:

Mistress Adrienne, I have been given a bed with a pink dresser 
In the hothouse 
Joining the Concord Public Library: the walls and roof are 
Glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, 
Violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. 
I get my meals 
With the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine 
To use. I scour, sweep, and dust. 
I hope you don’t think of me 
As a runaway? I remember your kindness, 
Your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. 
My journey was unusual. I saw some of the war 
And it was terrible even far up into the North. 
My first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis 
Where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened   
Quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first 
I helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox 
Of the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman 
In the passenger car who was searching for his runaway 
Negress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me, 

And I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into 
An open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me 
A man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl 
Maybe twelve years of age, across from them 
A sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, 
By afternoon she was dead, her two friends 
Just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture 
Frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. 
The girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces 
Just ran straight through me and all I could do was 
Squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters 
And hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms 
To mend and when the others slept I dressed in three 
Shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, 
The padding helped some but I couldn’t walk the next day. 
I hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock 
Of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall 
Split palings. The next morning from a hill 
I watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took 
Two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from 
A battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit 
In its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all 
The way to Youngstown. Chloe, you must 
Learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel. 
I am grateful. I had to swim two rivers. I fished some 
For perch, bream, and trout and ate dried berries.   
I stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse. 
I treated my sores with blackgum from poplars. I witnessed 
The hanging of three Confederate soldiers at a trestle: 
Once they were done dancing, they settled in their greatcoats 
Like dead folded birds. I have a hatred 
Of men and I walked away from the trestle singing. 
I spoke to The Concord Literary Club last Tuesday 
About my experiences. I told them you never did 
Abuse me. How we would sit out in the gazebo 
And listen to the boys with their violins, tambourines, 
Bones, drums and sticks. How we wept as girls 
When the fox bit the head off our peahen and that 
From that day how the peacock, missing his mate, would 
See her in his reflection in a downstairs window 
And fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations. 
When I left you the windows were all missing and daubers 
Were making their mud houses in the high corners 
Of the hallway. With sugar-water and crepe I have put a new 
Hem on my purple dress. 

At night I walk down the aisles 
Of the library, the books climb twenty feet above me,   
I just walk there naked with my tiny lamp. 
I have the need to fling the lamp sometimes: but I resist it. 
Mistress Adrienne, I saw three big cities burning! 
Did you know ladies from Philadelphia rode for two days 
In wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched 
The war like a horse-pulling contest at a fair. 
The man beside me on the train who was sucking the little 
Girl’s breasts, he was your stable boy, Napoleon. He said 
He never had a bad word for you. His little mistress was 
Still bare to the waist and before I leapt from the train, 
And while he slept, I ran a rod into his eye. I stabbed him 
In his brain. She stopped weeping. 
Remember that French lullaby where two fleas in a gentleman’s 
Mustache die like a kiss between the lips of the gentleman 
And his mistress. How we laughed at it! 
I hope you were not long unconscious there beside the pond. 
I just ran away from you, listening the whole night 
For your father’s hounds. I am 
Afraid I split your parasol on your skull. If I 
Don’t hear from you I will try to understand. Chloe.

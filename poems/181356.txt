Shunning the British tourist bus, we walk, 
My child and I, the West Woods where, like dogs 
Who know their death is due, the wounded took 
Themselves to give up hope. The horror begs 
Imagining—the soldiers hauling limbs 
Hacked off or messmates dead, and everywhere, 
Mixed with the summer scent of swelling plums, 
A stench of putrid flesh and burning hair. 
Here Lee was turned. That night the forest filled 
With muttered names of loved ones left, and cries 
From mangled soldiers pleading to be killed. 
Seeing my distant look, my daughter tries 
My sleeve: “What is it, what?” she asks, and I 
Say “nothing, nothing”—though “nothing” is a lie.

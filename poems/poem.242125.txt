Sonnet

From Daddy sprung my inborn ribaldry.
His crudeness destined me to be the same.
A seedlet, flowered from a shitty heap, 
I came, the crowning glory of his aim.

From Mother I inherited ennui, 
The leg irons of the queendom I once rattled.
But I won't let such chains imprison me. 
And there is just no telling what this brat'll...!

This marriage thing? We snub our nose at it.
What's pearl turns piss, what's classy breeds what's smutty.
But like it? Lump it? Neither's exigent.
And I'm the end result of all that fucking.

Do what you will! This world's your oyster, Pet.
But be forewarned. The sea might drown you yet.

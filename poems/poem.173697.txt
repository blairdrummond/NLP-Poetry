Free Verse, Imagist

(The fantasia of a fallen gentleman on a cold, bitter night.)
Once, in finesse of fiddles found I ecstasy, 
In the flash of gold heels on the hard pavement. 
Now see I 
That warmth's the very stuff of poesy. 
Oh, God, make small 
The old star-eaten blanket of the sky, 
That I may fold it round me and in comfort lie.

title : My Daughter at the Gymnastics Party

author : David Bottoms

text : 
When I sat for a moment in the bleachers 
of the lower-school gym 
to watch, one by one, the girls of my daughter’s kindergarten   
climb the fat rope hung over the Styrofoam pit, 
I remembered my sweet exasperated mother 
and those shifting faces of injury 
that followed me like an odor to ball games and practices,   
playgrounds of monkey bars 
and trampolines, those wilted children sprouting daily   
in that garden of trauma behind her eyes. 

Then Rachel’s turn, 
the smallest child in class, and up she went, legs twined   
on the rope, ponytail swinging, fifteen, twenty,   
twenty-five feet, the pink tendrils of her leotard   
climbing without effort 
until she’d cleared the lower rafters. 
She looked down, then up, hanging in that balance   
of pride and fear, 
                           then glancing 
toward the bleachers to see if I watched, let go   
her left hand, unworried by that boy 
with the waffled skull, stiff and turning blue   
under the belly of a horse, 
or the Christmas Eve skater on Cagle’s Lake,   
her face a black plum 
against the bottom of the ice.

title : Alas, Kind Element!

author : Léonie Adams

text : 
Then I was sealed, and like the wintering tree   
I stood me locked upon a summer core; 
Living, had died a death, and asked no more.   
And I lived then, but as enduringly, 
And my heart beat, but only as to be. 
Ill weathers well, hail, gust and cold I bore,   
I held my life as hid, at root, in store: 
Thus I lived then, till this air breathed on me.   
Till this kind air breathed kindness everywhere,   
There where my times had left me I would stay.   
Then I was staunch, I knew nor yes nor no; 
But now the wishful leaves have thronged the air.   
My every leaf leans forth upon the day; 
Alas, kind element! which comes to go.

Try to remember: things go wrong in spite of it all. 
I listen to our daughters singing in the crackling rows 
of corn and wonder why I don't love them more. 
They move like dark birds, small mouths open 

to the sky and hungry. All afternoon I listen 
to the highway and watch clouds push down over the hills. 
I remember your legs, heavy with sleep, lying across mine. 
I remember when the world was transparent, trembling, all 

shattering light. I had to grit my teeth against its brilliance. 
It was nothing like this stillness that makes it difficult 
to lift my eyes. When I finally do, I see you 
carrying the girls over the sharp stones of the creek bed. 

When they pull at my clothes and lean against my arms, 
I don't know what to do and do nothing.

title : Neighbors in October

author : David Baker

text : 
All afternoon his tractor pulls a flat wagon 
with bales to the barn, then back to the waiting 
chopped field. It trails a feather of smoke. 
Down the block we bend with the season: 
shoes to polish for a big game, 
storm windows to batten or patch. 
And how like a field is the whole sky now 
that the maples have shed their leaves, too. 
It makes us believersâ€”stationed in groups, 
leaning on rakes, looking into space. We rub blisters 
over billows of leaf smoke. Or stand alone, 
bagging gold for the cold days to come.

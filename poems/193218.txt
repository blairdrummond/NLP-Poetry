title : To Whistler, American

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
On the loan exhibit of his paintings at the Tate Gallery.
You also, our first great, 
Had tried all ways; 
Tested and pried and worked in many fashions, 
And this much gives me heart to play the game. 

Here is a part that's slight, and part gone wrong, 
And much of little moment, and some few 
Perfect as Dürer! 

"In the Studio" and these two portraits,* if I had my choice I 
And then these sketches in the mood of Greece? 

You had your searches, your uncertainties, 
And this is good to know—for us, I mean, 
Who bear the brunt of our America 
And try to wrench her impulse into art. 

You were not always sure, not always set 
To hiding night or tuning "symphonies"; 
Had not one style from birth, but tried and pried 
And stretched and tampered with the media. 

You and Abe Lincoln from that mass of dolts 
Show us there's chance at least of winning through.

title : The Exam

It is mid-October. The trees are in 
 their autumnal glory (red, yellow-green,

 orange) outside the classroom where students 
 take the mid-term, sniffling softly as if

 identifying lines from Blake or Keats
 was such sweet sorrow, summoned up in words

 they never saw before. I am thinking
 of my parents, of the six decades they’ve

 been together, of the thirty thousand
 meals they’ve eaten in the kitchen, of the

 more than twenty thousand nights they’ve slept
 under the same roof. I am wondering

 who could have fashioned the test that would have
 predicted this success? Who could have known?

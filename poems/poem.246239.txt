While that my soul repairs to her devotion, 
Here I intomb my flesh, that it betimes 
May take acquaintance of this heap of dust; 
To which the blast of death's incessant motion, 
Fed with the exhalation of our crimes, 
Drives all at last. Therefore I gladly trust

My body to this school, that it may learn 
To spell his elements, and find his birth 
Written in dusty heraldry and lines ; 
Which dissolution sure doth best discern, 
Comparing dust with dust, and earth with earth. 
These laugh at jet, and marble put for signs,

To sever the good fellowship of dust, 
And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them, 
When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat 
To kiss those heaps, which now they have in trust? 
Dear flesh, while I do pray, learn here thy stem 
And true descent: that when thou shalt grow fat,

And wanton in thy cravings, thou mayst know, 
That flesh is but the glass, which holds the dust 
That measures all our time; which also shall 
Be crumbled into dust. Mark, here below, 
How tame these ashes are, how free from lust, 
That thou mayst fit thyself against thy fall.

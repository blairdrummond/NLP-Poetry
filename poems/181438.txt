title : The Sea Shell

author : Marin Sorescu

text : 
I have hidden inside a sea shell 
but forgotten in which. 

Now daily I dive, 
filtering the sea through my fingers, 
to find myself. 
Sometimes I think 
a giant fish has swallowed me. 
Looking for it everywhere I want to make sure 
it will get me completely. 

The sea-bed attracts me, and 
I’m repelled by millions 
of sea shells that all look alike. 
Help, I am one of them. 
If only I knew, which. 

How often I’ve gone straight up 
to one of them, saying: That’s me. 
Only, when I prised it open 
it was empty.

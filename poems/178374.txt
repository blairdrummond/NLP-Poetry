text : 
Late in the cold night wakened, and heard wind,   
And lay with eyes closed and silent, knowing   
These words how bodiless they are, this darkness   
Empty under my roof and the panes rattling   
Roughed by wind. And so lay and imagined   
Somewhere far off black seas heavy-shouldered   
Plunging on sand and the ebb off-streaming and   
Thunder forever. So lying bethought me, friend,   
What traffic ghouls have, or this be legend,   
In low inland hollows of the earth, under 
Shade of moon, the night moaning, and bitter frost;   
And feared the riches of my bones, long given   
Into this earth, should tumble to their hands.   
No girl or ghost beside me, and I lonely,   
Remembering gardens, lilac scent, or twilight   
Descending late in summer on that town,   
I lay and found my years departed from me,   
And feared the cold bed and the wind, absurdly   
Alone with silence and the trick of tears.

title : Things We Dreamt We Died For

author : Marvin Bell

text : 
Flags of all sorts. 
The literary life. 
Each time we dreamt we’d done   
the gentlemanly thing, 
covering our causes 
in closets full of bones 
to remove ourselves forever   
from dearest possibilities, 
the old weapons re-injured us,   
the old armies conscripted us,   
and we gave in to getting even,   
a little less like us 
if a lot less like others. 
Many, thus, gained fame 
in the way of great plunderers,   
retiring to the university 
to cultivate grand plunder-gardens   
in the service of literature,   
the young and no more wars.   
Their continuing tributes   
make them our greatest saviors,   
whose many fortunes are followed   
by the many who have not one.

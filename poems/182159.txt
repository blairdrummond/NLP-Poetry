Pity the bathtub that belongs to the queen its feet 
Are bronze casts of the former queen’s feet its sheen 
A sign of fretting is that an inferior stone shows through 
Where the marble is worn away with industrious 
Polishing the tub does not take long it is tiny some say 
Because the queen does not want room for splashing 
The maid thinks otherwise she knows the king 
Does not grip the queen nightly in his arms there are 
Others the queen does not have lovers she obeys 
Her mother once told her your ancestry is your only 
Support then is what she gets in the bathtub she floats 
Never holds her nose and goes under not because 
She might sink but because she knows to keep her ears 
Above water she smiles at the circle of courtiers below 
Her feet are kicking against walls which cannot give 
Satisfaction at best is to manage to stay clean 

2. 
Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the whims of 
One man loves but is not loved in return by the object 
Of his affection there is little to tell of his profession 
There is more for it is because he works with glass 
That he thinks things are clear (he loves) and adjustable 
(she does not love) he knows how to take something 
Small and hard and hot and make room for 
His breath quickens at night as he dreams of her he wants 
To create a present unlike any other and because he cannot 
Hold her he designs something that can a bathtub of 
Glass shimmers red when it is hot he pours it into the mold 
In a rush of passion only as it begins to cool does it reflect 
His foolishness enrages him he throws off his clothes meaning 
To jump in and lie there but it is still too hot and his feet propel 
Him forward he runs from one end to the other then falls 
To the floor blisters begin to swell on his soft feet he watches 
His pain harden into a pretty pattern on the bottom of the bath

Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the human 
Form may define external appearance but there is room 
For improvement within try a soap dish that allows for 
Slippage is inevitable as is difference in the size of 
The subject may hoard his or her bubbles at different 
Ends of the bathtub may grasp the sponge tightly or 
Loosely it may be assumed that eventually everyone gets in 
The bath has a place in our lives and our place is 
Within it we have control of how much hot how much cold 
What to pour in how long we want to stay when to 
Return is inevitable because we need something 
To define ourselves against even if we know that 
Whenever we want we can pull the plug and get out 
Which is not the case with our own tighter confinement 
Inside the body oh pity the bathtub but pity us too

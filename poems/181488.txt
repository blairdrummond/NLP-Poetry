title : I Imagine My Father’s Death

author : Bryan D. Dietrich

text : 
I imagine my father’s death. It is bigger 
than a breadbox. It is bigger than a Ford 
Escort, than a Zeppelin, black and vast 
and slow moving, oozing over an Oklahoma 
arena. It is bigger than any arena, than 
Oklahoma. My father’s death is bigger 
than a planet, bigger than the gravity 
wells worlds make, that stars stir up after 
implosion. It is bigger than all the stars. 
It takes up all space, all dimension, all 
that is or ever was. It hates everything 
it isn’t. It makes new space, new matter 
from all it is. My father’s death takes on 
form and void and says, “Let there be light.” 
And there is light. It says, “Let there be   
worlds.” And there are worlds. It says,   
“Let there be a garden and a man in it.” 
And there is a man. The man is my father. 
He looks around, marveling at this thing 
his death has made, then sets out to find 
someone, anyone, with whom to share it.

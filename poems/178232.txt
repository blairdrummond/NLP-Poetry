title : We Tend to Sleep Better When the Clock Is Wound

author : Todd Boss

text : 
than we do
when it’s all 

wound down. 
I don’t know 

why we settle
to the sound.

Somehow
the regular

click and chime
of passing time,

like water, turns
a water wheel

that turns a gear
that turns a stone

that turns upon 
another stone

and fine 
and finer in between

our dreams like grain
are ground.

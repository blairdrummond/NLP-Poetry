text : 
Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered,
 sibilant similes and promises sotto voce.
 It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard,
 
the form and content clash, create this weird
 distortion like an echo or a tape delay.
 Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered.
 
On which do you place emphasis: The words?
 Or the breath? The farfetched or the foreplay?
 It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard
 
when objectivity has disappeared
 and your lover is getting further carried away.
 Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered
 
vows? It’s hard to take him at his word,
 or hers: Speak up! Proclaim! you want to say.
 It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard,
 
hard to admit one sharp as you is stirred.
 You need to back off, cool down, act blasé.
 Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered.
 It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard.

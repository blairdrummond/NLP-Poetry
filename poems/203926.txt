title : Gravelly Run

author : A. R. Ammons

text : 
I don’t know somehow it seems sufficient 
to see and hear whatever coming and going is, 
losing the self to the victory 
   of stones and trees, 
of bending sandpit lakes, crescent 
round groves of dwarf pine: 

for it is not so much to know the self   
as to know it as it is known 
   by galaxy and cedar cone, 
as if birth had never found it 
and death could never end it: 

the swamp’s slow water comes   
down Gravelly Run fanning the long   
   stone-held algal 
hair and narrowing roils between   
the shoulders of the highway bridge: 

holly grows on the banks in the woods there,   
and the cedars’ gothic-clustered 
   spires could make 
green religion in winter bones: 

so I look and reflect, but the air’s glass   
jail seals each thing in its entity: 

no use to make any philosophies here: 
   I see no 
god in the holly, hear no song from 
the snowbroken weeds: Hegel is not the winter   
yellow in the pines: the sunlight has never   
heard of trees: surrendered self among 
   unwelcoming forms: stranger, 
hoist your burdens, get on down the road.

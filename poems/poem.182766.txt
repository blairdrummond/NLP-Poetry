Sonnet

The soft-toned clock upon the stair chimed three--
   Too sweet for sleep, too early yet to rise. 
   In restful peace I lay with half-closed eyes, 
Watching the tender hours go dreamily; 
The tide was flowing in; I heard the sea 
   Shivering along the sands; while yet the skies 
   Were dim, uncertain, as the light that lies 
Beneath the fretwork of some wild-rose tree 
Within the thicket gray. The chanticleer 
   Sent drowsy calls across the slumbrous air; 
   In solemn silence sweet it was to hear 
My own heart beat . . . Then broad and deep and fair--
   Trembling in its new birth from heaven's womb--
   One crimson shaft of dawn sank thro' my room.

title : New Stanzas for Amazing Grace

author : Allen Ginsberg

text : 
I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place 
Where I was lost alone 
Folk looked right through me into space 
And passed with eyes of stone 

O homeless hand on many a street 
Accept this change from me 
A friendly smile or word is sweet 
As fearless charity 

Woe workingman who hears the cry 
And cannot spare a dime 
Nor look into a homeless eye 
Afraid to give the time 

So rich or poor no gold to talk 
A smile on your face 
The homeless ones where you may walk 
Receive amazing grace 

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place 
Where I was lost alone 
Folk looked right through me into space 
And passed with eyes of stone

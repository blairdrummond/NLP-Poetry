title : [Sonnet] You jerk you didn't call me up

author : Bernadette Mayer

text : 
You jerk you didn't call me up 
I haven't seen you in so long 
You probably have a fucking tan 
& besides that instead of making love tonight 
You're drinking your parents to the airport 
I'm through with you bourgeois boys 
All you ever do is go back to ancestral comforts 
Only money can getâ€”even Catullus was rich but 

Nowadays you guys settle for a couch 
By a soporific color cable t.v. set 
Instead of any arc of love, no wonder 
The G.I. Joe team blows it every other time 

Wake up! It's the middle of the night 
You can either make love or die at the hands of the Cobra Commander

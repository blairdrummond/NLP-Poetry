title : Lust

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
Lust is at home here and I make it welcome.
I offer it stuff it accepts but would otherwise take.
        Beautiful telling ache.
Lust will be last to leave this all-nite affair,
        Make no mistake,
        And it was welcome,
        But I live here.

title : Snowmen

author : Agha Shahid Ali

text : 
My ancestor, a man 
of Himalayan snow, 
came to Kashmir from Samarkand, 
carrying a bag 
of whale bones: 
heirlooms from sea funerals. 
His skeleton 
carved from glaciers, his breath 
arctic, 
he froze women in his embrace. 
His wife thawed into stony water, 
her old age a clear 
evaporation. 

This heirloom, 
his skeleton under my skin, passed 
from son to grandson, 
generations of snowmen on my back. 
They tap every year on my window, 
their voices hushed to ice. 

No, they won’t let me out of winter, 
and I’ve promised myself, 
even if I’m the last snowman, 
that I’ll ride into spring 
on their melting shoulders.

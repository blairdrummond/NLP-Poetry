Symbolist

Under Mirabeau Bridge the river slips away 
          And lovers 
    Must I be reminded 
Joy came always after pain 


         The night is a clock chiming 
         The days go by not I 


We're face to face and hand in hand 
         While under the bridges 
    Of embrace expire 
Eternal tired tidal eyes 


         The night is a clock chiming 
         The days go by not I 


Love elapses like the river 
         Love goes by 
    Poor life is indolent 
And expectation always violent 


         The night is a clock chiming 
         The days go by not I 


The days and equally the weeks elapse 
         The past remains the past 
    Love remains lost 
Under Mirabeau Bridge the river slips away 


         The night is a clock chiming 
         The days go by not I

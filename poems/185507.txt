title : Warning from a Visitor in the Control Tower

author : Calvin Thomas Jr.

text : 
To airmen crossing and communicant 
With orders of this field, no landing here 
But by the grace of God; no postulant 
Piloting earthward should abuse his fear: 
Trust in the instruments which fall their round, 
Tonight the only ceiling is the ground; 
Zero, from nothing into nothing made, 
Signifies all of altitude that stayed. 


Notice the fog that makes me all but blind; 
Here in the tower my skeleton will do 
To signal you. I am for all your kind 
Tonight’s full complement and only crew. 
Airmen, I hope you read loud and clear; 
Your radios sound happy and sincere: 
Roger, you say, and dive for wreaths of holly 
Thinking the next voice heard will be as jolly. 


Suggest you take along the death’s-head flag 
And hope that waving it will set you free. 
Judgment, like flights, may be a game of tag 
And you can shake and plead the Varsity. 
Say that team spirit was your only motive: 
You shot them up and did a locomotive. 
What if there is a temporary fetter? 
Christ understands. He also got his letter. 


I have you, heroes, holding each your course: 
You shot them up a little, and you grope 
Tonight with neither memory nor remorse; 
My skull is watching in the radarscope. 
I marvel as I track your sure downfall 
How you can navigate or fly at all 
For thinking of the tallies without log 
Until you make an error in this fog.

title : Trust

text : 
Trust that there is a tiger, muscular 
Tasmanian, and sly, which has never been 
seen and never will be seen by any human 
eye. Trust that thirty thousand sword- 
fish will never near a ship, that far 
from cameras or cars elephant herds live 
long elephant lives. Believe that bees 
by the billions find unidentified flowers 
on unmapped marshes and mountains. Safe 
in caves of contentment, bears sleep. 
Through vast canyons, horses run while slowly 
snakes stretch beyond their skins in the sun. 
I must trust all this to be true, though 
the few birds at my feeder watch the window 
with small flutters of fear, so like my own.

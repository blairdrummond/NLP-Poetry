title : Orange Berries Dark Green Leaves

author : John Taggart

text : 
Darkened not completely dark let us walk in the darkened field
 trees in the field outlined against that which is less dark
 under the trees are bushes with orange berries dark green leaves
 not poetry’﻿﻿s mixing of yellow light blue sky darker than that
 darkness of the leaves a modulation of the accumulated darkness
 orange of the berries another modulation spreading out toward us
 it is like the reverberation of a bell rung three times
 like the call of a voice the call of a voice that is not there.
  
 We will not look up how they got their name in a book of names
 we will not trace the name’﻿﻿s root conjecture its first murmuring
 the root of the berries their leaves is succoured by darkness
 darkness like a large block of stone hauled on a wooden sled
 like stone formed and reformed by a dark sea rolling in turmoil.

title : Ovid in the Third Reich

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
non peccat, quaecumque potest peccasse negare, solaque famosam culpa professa facit.  Amores, III, xiv 
I love my work and my children. God   
Is distant, difficult. Things happen.   
Too near the ancient troughs of blood   
Innocence is no earthly weapon. 

I have learned one thing: not to look down 
So much upon the damned. They, in their sphere,   
Harmonize strangely with the divine 
Love. I, in mine, celebrate the love-choir.

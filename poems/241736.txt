title : Lemon Tree

author : Landis Everson

text : 
A tree that grew in the Garden of Eden
 a tree of innocence called
 the Tree of Good and Evil. It was harmless
  
 as opposites are in balance. It was also
 tasteless,
 the taste of innocence before it is betrayed.
 When God removed the wall
  
 he gave the lemon thorns and bitterness because it had
 no hostility.
 It is a taste we want most to subdue. It asks
 to be left alone.
 We use it with fish and tea. We sugar it.
  
 Look out the window. It stands with a donkey’s
 stance, hoping the day will pass.
 Its scent through the curtains
 cuts through
 mustiness, sharp
 with sweet blossoms. It hides the smell
 of new babies.

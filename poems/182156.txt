title : Much Madness is divinest Sense - (620)

author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
Much Madness is divinest Sense -
To a discerning Eye -
Much Sense - the starkest Madness - 
’Tis the Majority 
In this, as all, prevail -
Assent - and you are sane -
Demur - you’re straightway dangerous - 
And handled with a Chain -

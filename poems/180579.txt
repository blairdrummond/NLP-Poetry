title : Shooting Star

author : Arthur Sze

text : 
1    In a concussion, 
      the mind severs the pain: 
      you don’t remember flying off a motorcycle, 
      and landing face first 
      in a cholla. 

      But a woman stabbed in her apartment, 
      by a prowler searching for 
      money and drugs, 
      will never forget her startled shriek 
      die in her throat, 
      blood soaking into the floor. 

      The quotidian violence of the world 
      is like a full moon rising over the Ortiz mountains; 
      its pull is everywhere. 
      But let me live a life of violent surprise 
      and startled joy. I want to 
      thrust a purple iris into your hand, 
      give you a sudden embrace. 

      I want to live as Wang Hsi-chih lived 
      writing characters in gold ink on black silk— 
      not to frame on a wall, 
      but to live the splendor now. 


2    Deprived of sleep, she hallucinated 
      and, believing she had sold the genetic 
      research on carp, signed a confession. 
      Picking psilocybin mushrooms in the mountains 

      of Veracruz, I hear tin cowbells 
      in the slow rain, see men wasted on pulque 
      sitting under palm trees. Is it 
      so hard to see things as they truly are: 

      a route marked in red ink on a map, 
      the shadows of apricot leaves thrown 
      in wind and sun on a wall? It is 
      easy to imagine a desert full of agaves 

      and golden barrel cactus, red earth, a red sun. 
      But to truly live one must see things 
      as they are, as they might become: 
      a wrench is not a fingerprint 

      on a stolen car, nor baling wire 
      the undertow of the ocean. I may hallucinate, 
      but see the men in drenched clothes 
      as men who saw and saw and refuse to see. 


3    Think of being a judge or architect 
      or trombonist, and do not worry whether 
      thinking so makes it so. I overhear 
      two men talking in another room; 

      I cannot transcribe the conversation 
      word for word, but know if they are 
      vexed or depressed, joyful or nostalgic. 
      An elm leaf floats on a pond. 

      Look, a child wants to be a cardiologist 
      then a cartographer, but wanting so 
      does not make it so. It is not 
      a question of copying out the Heart Sutra 

      in your own blood on an alabaster wall. 
      It is not a question of grief or joy. 
      But as a fetus grows and grows, 
      as the autumn moon ripens the grapes, 

      greed and cruelty and hunger for power 
      ripen us, enable us to grieve, act, 
      laugh, shriek, see, see it all as 
      the water on which the elm leaf floats. 


4    Write out the memories of your life 
      in red-gold disappearing ink, so that it all 
      dies, no lives. Each word you speak 
      dies, no lives. Is it all 
      at once in the mind? I once stepped 
      on a sea urchin, used a needle to dig out 
      the purple spines; blood soaked my hands. 
      But one spine was left, and I carried 
      it a thousand miles. I saw then 
      the olive leaves die on the branch, 
      saw dogs tear flesh off a sheep’s corpse. 
      To live at all is to grieve; 
      but, once, to have it all at once 
      is to see a shooting star: shooting star 
      shooting star.

title : Train Above Pedestrians

author : Reginald Gibbons

text : 
Where moonlight angles 
                  through the east-west streets, 
down among the old 
                  for America 
tall buildings that changed 
                  the streets of other 
cities circulate 
                  elevated trains 
overhead shrieking 
                  and drumming, lit by 
explosions of sparks 
                  that harm no one and 
the shadowed persons 
                  walking underneath 
the erratic waves 
                  not of the lake but 
of noise move through fog 
                  sieved by the steel mesh 
of the supporting 
                  structures or through rain 
that rinses pavements 
                  and the el platforms 
or through new snow that 
                  quiets corners, moods, 
riveted careers.   
                  Working for others 
with hands, backs, machines, 
                  men built hard towers 
that part the high air,   
                  women and men built, 
cooked, cleaned, delivered, 
                  typed and filed, carried 
and delivered, priced 
                  and sold. The river 
and air were filthy. 
                  In a hundred years 
builders would migrate 
                  north a mile but in 
these modern times this 
                  was all the downtown 
that was. And circling 
                  on a round-cornered   
rectangle of tracks 
                  run the trains, clockwise 
and counter, veering 
                  through or loop-the-loop 
and out again. Why 
                  even try to list   
the kinds of places   
                  men and women made 
to make money? Not 
                  enough of them, yet 
too many. From slow 
                  trains overhead some 
passengers can still 
                  see stone ornaments, 
pilasters, lintels, 
                  carved by grandfathers, 
great uncles and gone 
                  second cousins of   
today—gargoyle heads 
                  and curving leaves, like 
memorials for 
                  that which was built to 
be torn down again 
                  someday, for those who 
got good wages out 
                  of all this building 
or were broken by   
                  it, or both, yet whose   
labor preserves a   
                  record of labor,   
imagination, 
                  ambition, skill, greed, 
folly, error, cost, 
                  story, so that a   
time before remains 
                  present within the 
bright careening now.

title : Inscrutable Twist

The twist of the stream was inscrutable.   
It was a seemingly run-of-the-mill   
stream that flowed for several miles by the side   
of Route 302 in northern Vermont—   
and presumably does still—but I’ve not   
been back there for what seems like a long time.   

I have it in my mind’s eye, the way   
one crested a rise and rounded a corner   
on the narrow blacktop, going west, and saw   
off to the left in the flat green meadow   
the stream turning briefly back on itself   
to form a perfect loop—a useless light-filled   
water noose or fragment of moon’s cursive,   
a sign or message of some kind—but left behind.

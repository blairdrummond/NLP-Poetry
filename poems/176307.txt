title : Things I’m Not Good At

author : Jeff Moss

text : 
What a shame I’m not good at making my bed 
Or washing the dinner dishes. 
What a pity I’m awful at broccoli-eating 
And feeding my sister's fishes. 
So sad I’ve no talent for cleaning my room, 
All those jobs—it’s so hard to get through them. 
(If I tell you I’m no good at those kinds of things, 
Maybe then you won’t ask me to do them.)

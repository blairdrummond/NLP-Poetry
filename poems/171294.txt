The northern lights.         I wouldn’t have noticed them 
    if the deer hadn’t told me 
    a doe         her coat of pearls         her glowing hoofs 
                      proud and inquisitive 
                      eager for my appraisal 
and I went out into the night with electrical steps 
    but with my head held also proud 
                      to share the animal’s fear 
                      and see what I had seen before 
    a sky flaring and spectral 
                      greenish waves and ribbons 
and the snow         under strange light         tossing in the pasture 
    like a storming ocean caught 
                      by a flaring beacon. 
    The deer stands away from me         not far 
                      there among bare black apple trees 
                      a presence I no longer see. 
    We are proud to be afraid 
                      proud to share 
the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars 
                      and flickers around our heads 
    like the saints’ cold spiritual agonies 
                      of old. 
I remember         but without the sense         other light-storms 
    cold memories discursive and philosophical 
                      in my mind’s burden 
    and the deer remembers nothing. 
We move our feet         crunching bitter snow         while the storm 
    crashes like god-wars down the east 
                      we shake the sparks from our eyes 
    we quiver inside our shocked fur 
                      we search for each other 
    in the apple thicket— 
                      a glimpse, an acknowledgment 
    it is enough and never enough— 
we toss our heads         and say good night 
    moving away on bitter bitter snow.

title : The Sheep Who Fastened the Sky to the Ground

After I found out that you were a sheep, 
it was always afternoon, and I stood trembling 
at the pasture fence, my hands full of dandelion 
and the longer grasses. How could I call you 

to come near? We had no names and only 
this place, this sun, the hill and its limitless sky 
held together by your gentle outline as you leaned 
toward tufts of grass. How beautiful you were, 

so still, so close to moving. I gathered 
bouquets of clover, strung violets from the fence slats. 
Sometimes I whispered, but the words disappeared 
before I knew what they were or what they meant.   

Once I saw darkness. I remember my eyes were open 
and there was nothing, only black, and my heart aching 
as I felt for my face and I was still human. While I cried,
stars came and traced sheep in the sky and the voice that knew 

never spoke. I fell asleep mistaking the scent of hay 
for your breath. To wake once from the sleep in which 
you are held, in which your name emanates without utterance 
from the being that cradles you—There is no other sleep. 

Now it is always afternoon. How can I call you 
when we have no names? I search 
for the clover and violets. There are always enough. 
My shadow is always the same length and shaped 

with arms and legs. Between us, the distance of field is green 
and exact; the sun gleams from its cloudless height—I know 
that there is enough time, that there is always enough.   
Please. Come to me, remember me: undo this world.

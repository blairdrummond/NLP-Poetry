title : Beginning

text : 
The moon drops one or two feathers into the field.   
The dark wheat listens. 
Be still. 
Now. 
There they are, the moon's young, trying 
Their wings. 
Between trees, a slender woman lifts up the lovely shadow 
Of her face, and now she steps into the air, now she is gone 
Wholly, into the air. 
I stand alone by an elder tree, I do not dare breathe 
Or move. 
I listen. 
The wheat leans back toward its own darkness, 
And I lean toward mine.

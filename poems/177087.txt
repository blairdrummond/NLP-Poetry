title : Mowing

Sleepy and suburban at dusk, 
I learn again the yard’s 
geometry, edging around the garden   
and the weedy knots of flowers, circling   
trees and shrubs, giving 
a wide berth to the berry patch, 
heavy and sprawled out of its bounds.   
Shoving such a machine 
around a fairway of dandelions, 
it is easy to feel absurd. 
The average lawn, left alone 
one hundred years, could become 
a hardwood forest. An admirable project.   
Still I carry on, following week on week   
the same mowing pattern, cutting edges,   
almost sprinting the last narrow swaths.   
And tonight, as I mow over 
the bushels of fallen peaches, 
sending pits soaring over the neighbors’ fences,   
seems hardly any different. 
But on one crooked march I walk 
across the thin hidden hole 
to a yellowjacket hive. The blade pulls   
them up from their deep sweet chamber   
just as my bare legs go by. 

A bee lands heavily, 
all blunder and revenge, and the sting   
is a quick embrace and release, 
like the dared kid’s run and touch   
of a blind man. I’m blind now 
with the shock and pain of it, 
howling in a sprint toward the house, 
the mower flopped on its side, wild blade loose   
in the darkening air. 
                                 Later, 
the motor sputtered quiet, starved by tilt,   
I’m back in the twilight, 
a half-dozen stings packed in wet tobacco,   
carrying a can of gasoline, a five-foot torch.   
The destruction is easy: shove can 
slow to entranceway lip, pull 
back and light torch, use torch 
to tip can. One low whump and it’s over.   
A few flaming drones flutter out and fall.   
Stragglers, late returners, cruise 
wide circles around the ruins. 
In the cool September night they fly 
or die. In the morning I finish my chores. 

All the way to winter the blackened hole   
remains. On Christmas Eve a light   
late snow covers it and all 
the lawn’s other imperfections: crabgrass   
hummocks, high maple roots, 
the mushroom-laden fairy ring that defies   
obliteration and appears every spring   
more visible than ever. Standing 
in the window, the scent 
of pine powerful around me, 
the snap of wood undoing itself in the stove,   
I wonder at this thin and cold 
camouflage, falling, 
gradually falling over what has gone   
and grown before. And I hear 
that other rattle and report, that engine 
driven by another fire. I think of a gold   
that is sweet and unguent, a gold   
that is a blaze of years behind me.   
I hear wind in its regular passes   
blowing across the roof, 
feel in my legs a minute and icy tingling, 
as though I have stood too long 
in one place or made again another wrong step,   
as though the present itself   
were a kind of memory, coiled, waiting,   
dying to be seen from tomorrow.

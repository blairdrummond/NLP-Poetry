title : Then Too There Is This

joy in the day's being done, however    
clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists,    
the packages nestling together,    
no one home waiting for dinner, for    
you, no one impatient for your touch    
or kind words to salve what nightly    
rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling    
that one is really as alone as one had feared.    
One isn't, not really. Not really. Joy    
to see over the strip mall darkening    
right on schedule a neon-proof pink    
sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth,    
cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up    
and lit as if by a match struck somewhere    
in the throat much deeper down.

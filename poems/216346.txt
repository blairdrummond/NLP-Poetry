title : Landscape Survey

text : 
And what about this boulder, 
knocked off the moutaintop and 
tumbled down a thousand years ago

to lodge against the streambank,
 does it waste itself with worry
 about how things are going

to turn out? Does the current
 slicing around it stop itself mid-
stream because it can't get past

all it's left behind back at
the source or up in the clouds
where its waters first fell

to earth? And these trees,
 would they double over and
 clutch themselves or lash out

furiously if they were to discover
 what the other trees really
 thought of them? Would the wind

reascend into the sky forever,
like an in-drawn breath,
if it knew it was fated simply

to sweep the earth of windlessness,
 to touch everything and keep
 nothing and be beheld by no one?

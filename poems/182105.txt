The equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites. —Piet Mondrian
Some land lives 
so water can comb

it into grids. This
is why lowlands 

tilt still toward
the sea. This so 

we call our canal
leaning horse, 

hat tempting wind, 
somewhere a tear 

in linen where  
the loom bent 

a heddle. We plant
lapis in the middle

of begonia boxes
hung from our 

houseboat’s sills.
At night the eels 

snug against 
our houseboat’s hum, 

water’s warm hem. 
We hear them slip

itch into our floor.
Our houseboat lilts

when the bigger boats
slide us waves. 

Our concrete floats.
We’re mostly moored

to stay. In the damp
bank where the ducks

hedge weeds,
our bikes sleep.

We lean toward wind.
Our pant legs thin

from all the rain
on our knees.

From here the horizon
gauzes above us.

We are half hidden 
by light. We are folds

in fog. We stand 
open on the deck 

and beckon the silt 
to settle. We wait 

for a balance so grand 
that any flicker

of inverse could 
pull us up to spires.

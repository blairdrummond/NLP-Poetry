A Porphyry of Elements  

Starting in a long swale between the Sierras 
   and the Coast Range, 
Starting from ancient tidepools of a Pleistocene sea, 
Starting from exposed granite bedrock, 
From sandstone and shale, glaciated, river-worn, 
   and scuffed by wind, 
Tired of the extremes of temperature, 
   the weather’s wantonness, 
Starting from the survey of a condor’s eye 
Cutting circles in the sky over Tehachapi and Tejon, 
Starting from lava flow and snow on Shasta, 
   a head of white hair, 
   a garland of tongue-shaped obsidian, 
Starting from the death of the last grizzly, 
The final conversion of Tulare County 
   to the internal-combustion engine, 
Staring from California oak and acorn, 
   scrubgrass, rivermist, 
   and lupine in the foothills, 
From days driving through the outfield clover 
   of Modesto in a borrowed Buick, 
From nights drinking pitchers of dark 
   in the Neon Moon Bar & Grill, 
From mornings grabbing a lunchpail, work gloves, 
   and a pisspot hat, 
From Digger pine and Douglas fir and aspen around Placerville, 
From snowmelt streams slithering into the San Joaquin, 
From the deltas and levees and floods of the Sacramento, 
From fall runs of shad, steelhead, and salmon, 
From a gathering of sand, rock, gypsum, clay, 
   limestone, water, and tar, 
From a need or desire to throw your money away 
   in The Big City, 
From a melting of history and space in the crucible 
   of an oil-stained hand— 
Starting from all these, this porphyry of elements, 
   this aggregate of experiences 
Fused like feldspar and quartz to the azure stone 
   of memory and vision, 
Starting from all of these and an affectionate eye 
   for straight, unending lines, 
We hit this old road of Highway Ninety-Nine!

Cruising in the Greater Vehicle/A Jam Session 

“Well, goddamnit, Lawson! Whyn’t you play in key and keep to the 
rhythm? First you say you wanna go back to Fresno, back to the fish store 
and Kamaboko Gardens on the West Side, and then you say, forget it, I 
take it back, let’s go to the Sacto Bon-Odori instead.” 

“Yeah. And this ain’t even shoyu season yet, chump!” 

“Awww, hell. What’s wrong with you two? Can’t you improvise? You 
know, I’m just laying down a bass, man. Just a rhythm, a scale, 
something to jam on, something to change, find our range, something to 
get us going. Once we get started, we can work our way around to Weed, 
put on some tire chains, or break down in Selma, refuse to buy grapes, 
raisins, or Gallo, do a pit-stop at a Sacto sporting goods, pick up some air 
mattresses shaped like pearl-diving women, and float all day downriver to 
the deltas, sipping Cokes and saké in the summer heat.” 

“Shit. Whyn’t you just solo and forget the rest of us? You start chanting 
and pretty soon we’re hearing the entire Lotus Sutra.” 

“You two Buddhaheads just a pair of one-eyed Japs with dishpan hands 
and deadpan minds, man. This is the Champ Chonk talking, and we’re 
playing Chinese anaconda. Eight-card, no-peek pak-kai, roll your own, 
hi-lo, three for sweep, four for hot-sour soup stud, and neither of you’s 
put down your ante yet. So shit or get off the shu-mai, fellas.” 

“Calm down and watch the road, Alan.” 

“Who’s driving this heap, anyway?” 

“I thought you were.” 

“I thought Lawson was.” 

“Don’t worry. This is a dodo-driven, autopiloted, cruise-controlled, Triple- 
A-mapped, Flying-A-gassed, dual-overhead-cam, Super-Sofistifunktified, 
Frijole Guacamole, Gardena Guahuanco, Chonk Chalupa Cruiser with 
Buddha Bandit Bumpers, Jack!” 

“Where we going, Alan?” 

“Where do you think? We’re going to Paradise.” 

IV. 

On the Road to Paradise 

Distances don’t matter 
nor the roll of the road past walnut groves. 
It’s sky that counts, 
the color of it at dawn or sunset, 
a match more true to the peach 
than a mix of oils by Matisse. 
Or maybe it’s actually the weather 
we love most, the way it shifts 
and scatters over the state 
like radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon. 
The one over there, near Yuba City, 
rising over a backyard garden 
of onions, tomatoes, squash, and corn. 
The one with the spider 
scrambling through celery, 
harvesting moths and mayflies 
from the web it has strung between stalks. 
Sometimes I wish I could harvest the weather, 
reap it like wheat or rice, 
store it in a silo 
announcing steady rain or clear skies on its sides. 
When the prices rise, 
I could ship hailstorms or Santanas in orange crates, 
make Safeway go broke, 
do something politically efficacious for a change. 
But all I really do besides write these poems 
is allow my mind to wander while I drive. 
There it goes, down the arroyo, 
through manzanita and Mormon tea. 
Or there, up the mustard and Indian pipe on the hill. 
Might as well let it. 
Nothing but God and Country on the radio now. 
Wolfman Jack’s syndicated and the Dodgers 
haven’t made it to Vero Beach. 
I wish this road would turn or bend, 
intersect with a spy movie some Spanish galleon, 
or maybe a Chinese poem with landscapes 
in brocade, mist, wine, and moonlight. 
This California moon is yellow most of the time, 
like it was stained with nicotine, 
or sealed in amber like an insect. 
Why is it always better somewhere else? 
Why do I always wish I were Tu Fu?

 Palmistry Fantasia 
 

There, the pasteboard and neon hand! 
Just past the interchange by the bowling alley. 
The one with silver rockets, small green stars, 
and a trail of red comets flashing through the smog. 

It’s still here, the hand 
held up in greeting or command. 
“Halt!” it says, or 
“Peace be with you, brother,” 
while the map across its palm 
traces excursions into blue trees, 
green skies, and mushroom-colored lives. 

Blue dun is the color of its neon, 
the same as the throat feathers of a teal 
scudding over the marshes of Merced. 
It matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears, 
matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes. 

Her name is Alma Josephina, 
and she designed the sign herself, 
imitating the figure of her own hand, 
the neon indicative of its natural aura. 

That was twenty years ago 
when Eisenhower was President 
and all her customers wore pedal pushers 
or Bermudas, and never noticed 
the fireflies in the marshes at night. 

                           * 

You’re Oriental, aren’t you? 
Can you read tea leaves? 
I tried to once, years ago, 
had a Chinese woman teaching me, 
but her fees were too steep. 

I like a joke. 
It loosens up the customers. 

Well, come here towards the light. 
Let me get a good look 
at the ghosts in the grave of your palm. 
They’re there, you know. 
All the people you’ve ever been, 
all the trips you’ve taken 
and the towns you’ve settled in, 
back before the birth of Christ, 
back before people were people, 
before this paw was a hand. 

You see?   The whole palm glows 
like purple mist over a cemetery. 
Move closer.   Clamp it around the glass. 
See it flare on the inside? 
That’s the light your bones make, 
not the crystal at all. 

Look at your hand now. 
You can see yourself dancing 
on the heel just above the wrist. 
You must be a happy man. 
You’ll be born again and again, 
get to the threshold of Heaven, 
never enter but keep coming back, 
here, for fun, for friends, 
until this will be Paradise, 
and Paradise just an old resort 
the highway’s passed by. 

Well, have a nice trip. 
You’ll make it yet. 
Says so right in that curvy line 
around the Mound of Venus, 
that thumbstump there, 
right where the long straight line 
cuts across like an interstate.

Postcards Sent Home 

1.    
Dust rolls out of the hills like fog, 
and it’s too hot for shoes or shirts. 
I’d like to take my hair off too, 
peel it from my head, dip it in a bucket of ice, 
and wear it around my neck like a bandana. 

2. 
Crickets attend the night, 
add a falsetto drone 
to the sound of us 
pissing in the tumbleweeds. 

3.    
There’s a Tastee-Freeze in Fresno, 
A & Dub’s closed down, 
Jack-in-the-Box keeps popping up, 
and McDonald’s owns the town. 

4.    
Somebody’s drying tobacco leaves 
on the laundry line. 
There, see them furl 
and flap next to the nylons? 

5. 
A giant oak uncurls over the road, 
sprinkles a fine yellow powder on the windshield. 
The sun hits, touches it off 
in a spasm of golden-red light. 

VII. 

Body & Fender/Body & Soul 

At the grill, the Indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a round 
of coffee and sweet rolls. We’re waiting for the guy at Henley’s Texaco, 
down the street, to find us a fan belt that’ll fit.   It’s early, the sky’s still in 
the john, shaving, and the sports page has to wait to get in. Everybody’s 
grumpy. We sit around, jab at raisins with our forks, and try to look as 
tough as the waitresss. 

                           Her name’s Rita. Her brothers jump fires and pump 
oil in Alaska. Her sisters string beads and make babies back on the Res. 
Her ex is white, a logger who threatened never to come back and didn’t. 
She doesn’t hold any grudges. That’s why she’s so nice, why she pops her 
gum filling the salt and pepper shakers, why she adjusts her girdle so we 
can see, why the egg spot on her dress doesn’t show. 
                                              
                                             Outside, the sun eases up over 
the parking lot, scrambles across the freeway, and runs for cover behind a 
pile of pumpkin-colored clouds. 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars and 
pickups, getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud. We don’t watch.    
This is Redding, and ain’t nothing thing going on besides the day shift. 

                                             Alan says, “Look, there’s Venus,” and 
points to a piece of light draining the sky. I want to order a country- 
fried steak, talk about the Dodgers, but there isn’t time. Lawson hums a 
few chords, stirring the changes with his coffee spoon. 
                                     
                                                               Rita cruises back like 
a bus bound for Reno, starts dealing some ashtrays. She says, “How’s it 
going boys?” 

               I answer for all of us—“Hey, Rita. It’s almost gone.” 

VIII. 

Pilgrimage to the Shrine 

Six hours since 
the Paradise Cutoff 
and running on empty. 
No gas stations or rest stops, 
no weigh station, no cops. 
Just miles of straight road 
and a long double-yellow 
unrolling in front of us. 

Alan recognized nothing. 
Lawson pops the glove, 
pulls out a penlight, 
and fingers the map, 
pronouncing a few mantras. 

Our headlights slide 
over a scarecrow 
made of tumbleweeds 
standing by the road. 

He’s wearing a kimono, 
a dark-blue stovepipe hat, 
his shoulders cloaked 
in a wreath of chrysanthemums. 

We pull over, 
back up, 
and he disappears 
into the pale- 
grey darkness. 

It’s smoke. 
We can smell it, 
so somebody’s 
got to be 
close by. 

But our eyes 
go blined, fill 
with tears and ashes 
as we stumble 
down the off-ramp. 

The smell of 
frying trout 
and steamed rice 
reaches us when 
we come to. 

An old hermit, 
dressed like the scarecrow, 
crawls out of his barracks 
and brings us tea. 

“Drink!” he says, 
“It’ll pick you up!” 
And so we drink, 
feeling drugged. 

Soft blues 
in the key 
of sleep 
suffocates the air. 

From up the mountain, 
the sound of obsidian, 
flaking in the wind. 
Clouds of black glass 
waltz around us. 

We dress ourselves 
in shrouds of tule reeds 
stitched with barbed wire, 
stained with salt and mud. 

We refuse to cry. 

We drift back 
to the highway, 
holding our fists 
like rattles, 
shaking them 
like bones.

Confessions of the Highway/The Hermit Speaks 

I know the rituals, the spells of grapes, 
the ceremonies of tomatoes, celery, and rice. 
I know the color of wind dressed for fiesta, 
and the names of carnivals in Spanish and Japanese. 
I am familiar with the determination of campesinos 
who migrate up and down the stretch of the state 
in search of crops ready for harvest. 
It’s all a dull ache in my back, 
small cuts on the throats of my fingers, 
and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs. 
For me, the oracle of the giant orange 
always predicts good fortune, 
yet, it never comes true. 
My stomach is full of sand and tar, 
a little bit of paint, a few crickets. 
I stand in swampwater up to my hips, 
and the stink of rotting figs 
escapes my armpits in small brown clouds. 
Scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp, 
make a small grove behind my left ear. 
I don’t know why sparrows and starlings 
refuse to approach me, to take the grass seed 
tucked in the cuffs of my trousers. 
Maybe it’s the stain of asphalt around my ankles, 
this copper sheen of sweat on my back. 
Sometimes, when the valley heat 
makes the bones in my feet 
start to hiss and burn, 
the desire to escape comes over me again. 
I can’t help it. 
My arms pull down a few telephone posts, 
my shoulders churn against the bindings. 
I feel myself wanting to sit up, 
begin to walk again, and thresh my way 
across rice fields and acres of alfalfa. 
For once I’d like to lift my face 
straight above Shasta into the sky, 
shout in unison with thunder, 
roar with the assurance of Santana wind, 
leap out of these bonds of copper and steel, 
slough off this skin of cement, 
and walk south or north or even west 
into the weather and the sea.

title : Dolls

author : David St. John

text : 
They are so like 
Us, frozen in a bald passion 
Or absent 
Gaze, like the cows whose lashes 
Sag beneath their frail sacks of ice. 
Your eyes are white with fever, a long   
Sickness. When you are asleep, 
Dreaming of another country, the wheat’s   
Pale surface sliding 
In the wind, you are walking in every breath   
Away from me. I gave you a stone doll, 
Its face a dry apple, wizened, yet untroubled.   
It taught us the arrogance of silence, 
How stone and God reward us, how dolls give us   
Nothing. Look at your cane, 
Look how even the touch that wears it away   
Draws up a shine, as the handle 
Gives to the hand. As a girl, you boiled   
Your dolls, to keep them clean, presentable;   
You’d stir them in enormous pots, 
As the arms and legs bent to those incredible   
Postures you preferred, not that ordinary, human   
Pose. How would you like me?— 
Leaning back, reading aloud from a delirious   
Book. Or sprawled across your bed, 
As if I’d been tossed off a high building   
Into the street, 
A lesson from a young government to its people.   
When you are asleep, walking the fields of another 
Country, a series of shadows slowly falling 
Away, marking a way, 
The sky leaning like a curious girl above a new   
Sister, your face a doll’s deliberate 
Ache of white, you walk along that grove of madness,   
Where your mother waits. Hungry, very still.   
When you are asleep, dreaming of another country,   
This is the country.

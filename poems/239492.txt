¿are you
on the other side
waiting 
for alarms 
in a desert 
of sleepless 
evaporations?

¿are you
beside yourself 
in the aisles
that distance
makes shorter

than light waves 
in the daylight
that pounds
a lead slab
in the soup
that the winter
dissolves?

¿are you 
the signal
that another plane
carves into wings
in rounded contusions
of a late afternoon
storm,
full of sparks
that the night hurries out
on Locust and serial
cheeks 
shrouded
in shiny costumes?

¿are you
a circle
like juntas
that the winter makes clear
on the shaved orbiting molecule
that the ear revolves
around,
in a retreat
of explosive 
fossils?

¿are you 
memorizing
the connections
between the hand
and the foot
and the torso
in reverse
of the automatic?

¿are you 
materializing
the unknown
without weather
to increase
the planet
otherwise?

¿are you
pocketing
the insurance claims
that parkas
and snow equips
with sutures
and hand grenades?

¿forever?

¿are you 
increasing
the tackle box
full of piers
to widen the sea
and shorten 
circuits
full of trees?

¿are you
feeding the unworn
through a parallel
shapelessness
in desert blooms
on the roots
of a tarp
milking masks?

¿are you 
remodeling
the world
as a breathing
action doll?

¿are you 
calm for knots 
like the guardian hell
that a sewer makes
for angels
in their last testimony
skewered 
like the pony 
was?

¿are you 
freezing in the open
course that half
of everything
enumerates
like clouds?

¿are you 
unwound in a fear
that a jacket
stores
for feed, in easy
shows
and rented
faces on the pain
of entry?

¿are you
good
like ovens?

title : Not Waving but Drowning

author : Stevie Smith

text : 
Nobody heard him, the dead man,   
But still he lay moaning: 
I was much further out than you thought   
And not waving but drowning. 

Poor chap, he always loved larkinglarking Playing tricks, kidding, fooling around. 
And now he’s dead 
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,   
They said. 

Oh, no no no, it was too cold always   
(Still the dead one lay moaning)   
I was much too far out all my life   
And not waving but drowning.

title : “Feuerzauber”

author : Louis Untermeyer

text : 
I never knew the earth had so much gold
   The fields run over with it, and this hill
Hoary and old,
   Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.

Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good 
   This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God! 
This fringe of wood,
   Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see 
   Your face grow mystical, as on that night 
You turned to me,
   And all the trembling worldand youwere white.

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb; 
   The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .
And you become
   A goddess standing in a world of fire!

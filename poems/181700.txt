title : Trout

author : Kathryn Starbuck

text : 
I do my best 
to keep pointlessness 
at bay. But here, 
wet above my 
knees, I let it fly. 
Here, hot and cold, 
fingers thick with 
thinking, I try to 
tie the fly and look 
for the net, loosening 
the philosophical   
knot of why I came 
here today, not yet 
knowing whether 
I’ll free or fry 
the rainbows 
and browns once 
they’re mine.

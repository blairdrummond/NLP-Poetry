title : The School Where I Studied

author : Yehuda Amichai

text : 
I passed by the school where I studied as a boy 
 and said in my heart: here I learned certain things 
 and didn't learn others. All my life I have loved in vain 
 the things I didn't learn. I am filled with knowledge, 
 I know all about the flowering of the tree of knowledge, 
 the shape of its leaves, the function of its root system, its pests and parasites. 
 I'm an expert on the botany of good and evil, 
 I'm still studying it, I'll go on studying till the day I die. 
 I stood near the school building and looked in. This is the room 
 where we sat and learned. The windows of a classroom always open 
 to the future, but in our innocence we thought it was only landscape 
 we were seeing from the window. 
 The schoolyard was narrow, paved with large stones. 
 I remember the brief tumult of the two of us 
 near the rickety steps, the tumult 
 that was the beginning of a first great love. 
 Now it outlives us, as if in a museum, 
 like everything else in Jerusalem.

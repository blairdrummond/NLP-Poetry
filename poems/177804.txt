title : Once, Driving West of Billings, Montana

I ran into the afterlife. 
No fluffy white clouds. Not even stars. Only sky   
dark as the inside of a movie theater 
at three in the afternoon and getting bigger all the time,   
expanding at terrific speed 
over the car which was disappearing, 
flattening out empty 
as the fields on either side. 

                                             It was impossible to think   
under that rain louder than engines. 
I turned off the radio to listen, let my head 
fill up until every bone 
was vibrating—sky. 

                            Twice, trees of lightning 
broke out of the asphalt. I could smell 
the highway burning. Long after, saw blue smoke twirling   
behind the eyeballs, lariats 
doing fancy rope tricks, jerking silver 
dollars out of the air, along with billiard cues, ninepins. 

I was starting to feel I could drive forever 
when suddenly one of those trees was right in front of me.   
Of course, I hit it— 
branches shooting stars down the windshield, 
poor car shaking like a dazed cow. 
I thought this time for sure I was dead 
so whatever was on the other side had to be eternity. 

Saw sky enormous as nowhere. Kept on driving.

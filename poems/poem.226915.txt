Rhymed Stanza

1 
By night when others soundly slept 
And hath at once both ease and Rest, 
My waking eyes were open kept 
And so to lie I found it best. 

2 
I sought him whom my Soul did Love, 
With tears I sought him earnestly. 
He bow'd his ear down from Above. 
In vain I did not seek or cry. 

3 
My hungry Soul he fill'd with Good; 
He in his Bottle put my tears, 
My smarting wounds washt in his blood, 
And banisht thence my Doubts and fears. 

4 
What to my Saviour shall I give 
Who freely hath done this for me? 
I'll serve him here whilst I shall live 
And Loue him to Eternity.

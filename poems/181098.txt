title : Stemming  from Stevens

text : 
It’s not enough to cover the rock with leaves 
 — as if  vernal fluidities 

could be enough for the stern assault of  fact. 
As if  a living ornament, 

light and subject to temporal  breezes, 
could be enough to overcome despair, 

that chunk of  something solid in the air, 
unmoving, as words repeated are. 

It’s not enough to cover despair 
with motion. Motion itself  is flawed, 

continuous motion a narrow, thin escape 
from what is rooted. Leaves do sway, 

but in truth, they’re only flapping out, 
ancillary, uncertain, buffeted 

this way and that. They remain the fact 
they are bound to, involuntary notions 

victim to the weather of  a day, 
gripped by what has thrust between the rocks, 

flexible as everything not rock is, 
reckless as imagining is reckless.

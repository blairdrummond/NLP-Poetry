title : Driving through Minnesota During the Hanoi Bombings

author : Robert Bly

text : 
We drive between lakes just turning green;   
Late June. The white turkeys have been moved   
A second time to new grass. 
How long the seconds are in great pain!   
Terror just before death, 
Shoulders torn, shot 
From helicopters. “I saw the boy 
being tortured with a telephone generator,”   
The sergeant said. 
“I felt sorry for him 
And blew his head off with a shotgun.”   
These instants become crystals, 
Particles 
The grass cannot dissolve. Our own gaiety   
Will end up 
In Asia, and you will look down in your cup   
And see 
Black Starfighters. 
Our own cities were the ones we wanted to bomb!   
Therefore we will have to 
Go far away 
To atone 
For the suffering of the stringy-chested   
And the short rice-fed ones, quivering   
In the helicopter like wild animals, 
Shot in the chest, taken back to be questioned.

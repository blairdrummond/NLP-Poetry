title : "Weep You No More, Sad Fountains"

text : 
Weep you no more, sad fountains; 
   What need you flow so fast? 
Look how the snowy mountains 
   Heaven’s sun doth gently waste. 
   But my sun’s heavenly eyes 
       View not your weeping,
       That now lie sleeping
   Softly, now softly lies 
            Sleeping. 

Sleep is a reconciling, 
   A rest that peace begets. 
Doth not the sun rise smiling 
   When fair at even he sets?
   Rest you then, rest, sad eyes, 
       Melt not in weeping 
       While she lies sleeping
Softly, now softly lies 
            Sleeping.

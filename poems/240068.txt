   to forty-six UC Santa Cruz students and    seven faculty arrested in Watsonville for   showing solidarity with two thousand   striking cannery workers who were mostly   Mexican women, October 27, 1985
“Mexican”
is not 
a noun
or an 
adjective

“Mexican”
is a life
long
low-paying
job

a check
mark on
 a welfare
police
form

more than
a word
a nail in
the soul
but

it hurts
it points
it dreams
it offends
it cries

it moves
it strikes
it burns 
just like
a verb

title : The Golden Hinde

text : 
On Christmas Day, Kathleen and I 
propel a raft with plastic spoons 
through the hissing fur of surf, 
             stirring as we go 
             an Alka-Seltzer sun. 

We pass Bolinas-Stinson School, 
the fire house, and Smiley's dive; 
extinguished geodesic domes 
             along the mesa road 
             where Cream Saroyan lives. 

With a telescope, my sister spies 
the erstwhile chemist of Argonne 
who left his post to polish glass. 
             As penance, he engraves 
             a glyph of hydrogen 

on the blank face of every cliff 
from Monterey to Inverness. 
Beside us, cormorants describe 
             the chop in grunts, then plunge 
             through thirty feet of grease. 

I try to hold my breath as long 
and cheat or fail. As evening comes 
we pass the final spit of land. 
             Once more around the Horn 
             and then we'll make for home.

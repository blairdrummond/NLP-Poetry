Where the western zun, unclouded,
   Up above the grey hill-tops,
Did sheen drough ashes, lofty sh'ouded,
   On the turf beside the copse,
      In zummer weather,
      We together,
      Sorrow-slighten, work-vorgetten,
      Gambol'd wi' the zun a-zetten.

There, by flow'ry bows o' bramble,
   Under hedge, in ash-tree sheades,
The dun-heair'd ho'se did slowly ramble
   On the grasses' dewy bleades,
      Zet free o' lwoads,
      An' stwony rwoads,
      Vorgetvul o' the lashes fretten,
      Grazen wi' the zun a-zetten.

There wer rooks a-beaten by us
   Drough the air, in a vlock,
An' there the lively blackbird, nigh us,
   On the meaple bough did rock,
      Wi' ringen droat,
      Where zunlight smote
      The yollow boughs o' zunny hedges
      Over western hills' blue edges.

Waters, drough the meads a-purlen,
   Glissen'd in the evenen's light,
An' smoke, above the town a-curlen,
   Melted slowly out o' zight;
      An' there, in glooms
      Ov unzunn'd rooms,
      To zome, wi' idle sorrows fretten,
      Zuns did set avore their zetten.

We were out in geames and reaces,
   Loud a-laughen, wild in me'th,
Wi' windblown heair, an' zunbrowned feaces,
   Leapen on the high-sky'd e'th,
      Avore the lights
      Wer tin'd o' nights,
      An' while the gossamer's light netten
      Sparkled to the zun a-zetten.

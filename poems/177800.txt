title : On A Moonstruck Gravel Road

author : Rodney Torreson

text : 
The sheep-killing dogs saunter home, 
wool scraps in their teeth. 

From the den of the moon 
ancestral wolves 
howl their approval. 

The farm boys, asleep in their beds, 
live the same wildness under their lids; 
every morning they come back 
through the whites of their eyes 
to do their chores, their hands pausing 
to pet the dog, to press 
its ears back, over the skull, 
to quiet that other world.

'O Jesus Christ! I'm hit,' he said; and died.? 
Whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed, 
                 The Bullets chirped--In vain, vain, vain!? 
                 Machine-guns chuckled--Tut-tut! Tut-tut!? 
                 And the Big Gun guffawed. 

Another sighed,--'O Mother,--mother,--Dad!' 
 Then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead.? 
                 And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud? 
                 Leisurely gestured,--Fool!?            
                 And the splinters spat, and tittered.

'My Love!' one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,? 
Till slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.? 
                 And the Bayonets' long teeth grinned; 
                 Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned; 
                 And the Gas hissed.

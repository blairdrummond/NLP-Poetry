text : 
   In one corner of the ward
 somebody was eating a raw chicken.
 The cheerful nurses did not see.
 With the tube down my throat
 I could not tell them.
 Nor did they notice the horror show
 on the TV set suspended over my windowless bed.
 The screen was dead
 but a torn face was clear. 
  
    I did not see my own
 in a mirror for weeks.
 When it happened,
 when I dared to face my face
 after the ravaging,
 it was not mine
 but something whittled, honed down
 to a sly resemblance.
 It, even the mirror, the pale room,
 the oxygen tank
 neat and black as a bomb
 in its portable crate—
 all was hallucination.
  
    But the bloody rooster,
 the stray pieces of bodies
 slung into dreamless nooks,
 the white-haired doll whimpering
 on a gift counter—
 those were real.
  
    I keep living there.
 Foolish. I am home. Half safe.

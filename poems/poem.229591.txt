In spite of all the learned have said, 
    I still my old opinion keep; 
The posture, that we give the dead, 
    Points out the soul's eternal sleep. 

Not so the ancients of these lands-- 
    The Indian, when from life released, 
Again is seated with his friends, 
    And shares again the joyous feast. 

His imaged birds, and painted bowl, 
    And venison, for a journey dressed, 
Bespeak the nature of the soul, 
    Activity, that knows no rest. 

His bow, for action ready bent, 
    And arrows, with a head of stone, 
Can only mean that life is spent, 
    And not the old ideas gone. 

Thou, stranger, that shalt come this way, 
    No fraud upon the dead commit-- 
Observe the swelling turf, and say 
    They do not lie, but here they sit. 

Here still a lofty rock remains, 
    On which the curious eye may trace 
(Now wasted, half, by wearing rains) 
    The fancies of a ruder race. 

Here still an aged elm aspires, 
    Beneath whose far-projecting shade 
(And which the shepherd still admires) 
    The children of the forest played! 

There oft a restless Indian queen 
    (Pale Shebah, with her braided hair) 
And many a barbarous form is seen 
    To chide the man that lingers there. 

By midnight moons, o'er moistening dews; 
    In habit for the chase arrayed, 
The hunter still the deer pursues, 
    The hunter and the deer, a shade! 

And long shall timorous fancy see 
    The painted chief, and pointed spear, 
And Reason's self shall bow the knee 
    To shadows and delusions here.

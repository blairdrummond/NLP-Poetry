FOR DAVID P—B
The eye follows, the land 
Slips upward, creases down, forms   
The gentle buttocks of a young   
Giant. In the nestle, 
Old adobe bricks, washed of   
Whiteness, paled to umber, 
Await another century. 

Star Jasmine and old vines 
Lay claim upon the ghosted land,   
Then quiet pools whisper   
Private childhood secrets. 

Flush on inner cottage walls   
Antiquitous faces, 
Used to the gelid breath 
Of old manors, glare disdainfully   
Over breached time. 

Around and through these   
Cold phantasmatalities,   
He walks, insisting 
To the languid air, 
Activity, music, 
A generosity of graces. 

His lupin fields spurn old 
Deceit and agile poppies dance 
In golden riot.   Each day is 
Fulminant, exploding brightly   
Under the gaze of his exquisite   
Sires, frozen in the famed paint   
Of dead masters. Audacious   
Sunlight casts defiance 
At their feet.

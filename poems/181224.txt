At night the states 
I forget them or I wish I was there 
          in that one under the 
Stars. It smells like June in this night 
          so sweet like air. 
I may have decided that the 
          States are not that tired 
Or I have thought so. I have 
          thought that. 

At night the states 
And the world not that tired 
          of everyone 
Maybe. Honey, I think that to 
          say is in 
light. Or whoever. We will 
          never 
replace you. We will never re- 
          place You. But 
in like a dream the floor is no   
          longer discursive 
To me it doesn’t please me by 
          being the vistas out my 
window, do you know what 
          Of course (not) I mean? 
I have no dreams of wake- 
          fulness. In 
wakefulness. And so to begin. 
          (my love.) 

At night the states 
talk. My initial continuing contr- 
          diction 
my love for you & that for me 
deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest 
          dust 
of it is sweetest but states no longer 
          how I 
would feel. Shirt 
that shirt has been in your arms 
          And I have 
that shirt is how I feel 

At night the states 
will you continue in this as- 
          sociation of 
matters, my Dearest? down 
          the street from 
where the public plaque reminds 
          that of private 
loving the consequential chain 
          trail is 
matters 

At night the states 
that it doesn’t matter that I don’t 
          say them, remember 
them at the end of this claustro- 
          phobic the 
dance, I wish I could see I wish 
          I could 
dance her. At this night the states 
          say them 
out there. That I am, am them 
          indefinitely so and 
so wishful passive historic fated 
          and matter- 
simple, matter-simple, an 
          eyeful. I wish 
but I don’t and little melody. 
          Sorry that these 
little things don’t happen any 
          more. The states 
have drained their magicks 
          for I have not 
seen them. Best not to tell. But 
          you 
you would always remain, I   
          trust, as I will 
always be alone. 

At night the states 
whistle. Anyone can live. I 
can. I am not doing any- 
          thing doing this. I 
discover I love as I figure. Wed- 
          nesday 
I wanted to say something in 
          particular. I have been 
where. I have seen it. The God 
          can. The people 
do some more. 

At night the states 
I let go of, have let, don’t 
          let 
Some, and some, in Florida, doing. 
          What takes you so 
long? I am still with you in that 
          part of the 
park, and vice will continue, but 
          I’ll have 
a cleaning Maine. Who loses 
          these names 
loses. I can’t bring it up yet, 
          keeping my 
opinions to herself. Everybody in 
          any room is a 
smuggler. I walked fiery and   
          talked in the 
stars of the automatic weapons 
          and partly for you 
Which you. You know. 
At night the states 
have told it already. Have 
          told it. I 
know it. But more that they 
          don’t know, I 
know it too. 

At night the states 
whom I do stand before in 
          judgment, I 
think that they will find 
          me fair, not 
that they care in fact nor do 
          I, right now 
though indeed I am they and 
          we say 
that not that I’ve 
          erred nor 
lost my way though perhaps 
          they did (did 
they) and now he is dead 
          but you 
you are not. Yet I am this 
          one, lost 
again? lost & found by one- 
          self 
Who are you to dare sing to me? 

At night the states 
accompany me while I sit here 
          or drums 
there are always drums what for 
          so I 
won’t lose my way the name of 
          a 
personality, say, not California 
          I am not 
sad for you though I could be 
          I remember 
climbing up a hill under tall 
          trees 
getting home. I was 
going to say that the air was 
          fair (I was 
always saying something like 
          that) but 
that’s not it now, and that 
          that’s not it 
isn’t it either 

At night the states 
dare sing to me they who seem 
          tawdry 
any more I’ve not thought I 
          loved them, only 
you it’s you whom I love 
the states are not good to me as 
          I am to them 
though perhaps I am not 
when I think of your being 
          so beautiful 

but is that your beauty 
          or could it be 
theirs I’m having such a 
          hard time remembering 
any of their names 
your being beautiful belongs 
          to nothing 
I don’t believe they should 
          praise you 
but I seem to believe they 
          should 
somehow let you go 

At night the states 
and when you go down to 
          Washington 
witness how perfectly anything 
          in particular 
sheets of thoughts what a waste 
          of sheets at 
night. I remember something 
          about an 
up-to-date theory of time. I 
          have my 
own white rose for I have 
          done 
something well but I’m not 
          clear 
what it is. Weathered, perhaps 
          but that’s 
never done. What’s done is 
          perfection. 

At night the states 
ride the train to Baltimore 
we will try to acknowledge what was 
but that’s not the real mirror 
          is it? nor 
is it empty, or only my eyes 
          are 
Ride the car home from Washington 
          no 
they are not. Ride the subway 
          home from 
Pennsylvania Station. The states 
          are blind eyes 
stony smooth shut in moon- 
          light. My 
French is the shape of this 
          book 
that means I. 

At night the states 
the 14 pieces. I couldn’t just 
walk on by. Why 
aren’t they beautiful enough 
in a way that does not 
          beg to wring 
something from a dry (wet) 
          something 
Call my name 

At night the states 
making life, not explaining anything 
but all the popular songs say call 
          my name 
oh call my name, and if I call 
          it out myself to 
you, call mine out instead as our 
          poets do 
will you still walk on by? I 
          have 
loved you for so long. You 
          died 
and on the wind they sang 
          your name to me 
but you said nothing. Yet you 
          said once before 
and there it is, there, but it is 
          so still. 
Oh being alone I call out my 
          name 
and once you did and do still in 
          a way 
you do call out your name 
to these states whose way is to walk 
on by that’s why I write too much 

At night the states 
whoever you love that’s who you 
          love 
the difference between chaos and 
          star I believe and 
in that difference they believed 
          in some 
funny way but that wasn’t 
          what I 
I believed that out of this 
          fatigue would be 
born a light, what is fatigue 
there is a man whose face 
          changes continually 
but I will never, something 
          I will 
never with regard to it or 
          never regard 
I will regard yours tomorrow 
I will wear purple will I 
and call my name 

At night the states 
you who are alive, you who are dead 
when I love you alone all night and 
          that is what I do 
until I could never write from your 
          being enough 
I don’t want that trick of making 
          it be coaxed from 
the words not tonight I want it 
          coaxed from 
myself but being not that. But I’d 
          feel more 
comfortable about it being words 
          if it 
were if that’s what it were for these 
          are the 
States where what words are true 
          are words 
Not myself. Montana, Illinois. 
          Escondido.

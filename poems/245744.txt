I close the wardrobe, it opens.
 I close the wardrobe, it opens.
  
 Is that the way it will always be,
 persistence as a form of flight;
  
 my summons the rising and slamming tight
 though rust will gather despite me?
  
 I’ve folded my dresses, placed them
 on shelves. I could affix
  
 another hinge, but the walls
 have become a cluster and repetition
  
 a way to light—to light
 through the absence it exposes.

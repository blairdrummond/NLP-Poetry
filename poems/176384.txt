title : Above the Human Nerve Domain

text : 
To unlock predisposives in carbon   
to cancel sleep as pyretical drachma   
not as transaxial summa 
or intense aboriginal invasive 
but as promenade 
as forgery by craft 
as soiled apparitional anagram 

yes 
as a dark stochastic wheat drained of its magic as drift   
being boundary 
being hellish invention as grasp 

I am thinking of aroused electrical blockage   
of human monsoon killing as treaty 
as breach 
as strangled impulse by identity 

I mean 
the psychic root which is stained by dialectical illness   
by the thought contained in black ozonal mirrors 
where general slaughter is reflected 
where the mind impels its wits by bleak molecular isolation   
by stunted mangrove withdrawal 
by absence from the life of euphoric solar trees 

such prone negation 
imploded from the realms of a suicide foundry   
of broken wisdom as diamond 
it is an eon of fallen snow in a well 
an injudicious barrier gone awry 
the ingrained Eurocentric example 
of the hatred of the darker integument 
with its combative belligerence against the core   
of volational mystery 

so what concerns me 
is a yoga which implodes the sun   
which compounds its runics   
the body then electric 
like a stunning sapphire serpent   
with the arc of its cells 
alive as interior alter species   
as an eye of analogical waters 

no longer of ennui 
of the praxis of perfidious helium atrocity   
extended by the vapour of betrayal 
by the dazed imperceptives in the molecules 

here 
in such preternatural enclave 
I swim in the murmur of sun dogs   
of kindled potentate spasms 
like interior distillation 
from Moorish pre-Copernica 

as if 
at the height of Kemetic day 
there existed the dauntless sphinxian geometries   
those pre-existent personas of lightning 
no longer of the form of gravity as bastion   
of lingering ammonia in the genes 

but of absent chemical flaw 
the body becoming 
the magic flight of a transmuted corium   
of the bell of a bloodless liminal amber

title : Devotion: The Burnt-Over District

author : Bruce Smith

text : 
Late fall in the villages of Pompey, Preble, Oran, Delphi Falls,   
      churched 
river and woods. In Homer and Ovid, the localities   
      and principalities 
of central New York, the hollows and corners of the   
      burnt-over districts 
visited by angels in the 1800's who led us to greatness: awakenings, 
gold, portents and lies, heaven, women's suffrage, and bundling 
with the other in the love beds while we waited for the lamb,   
the dove, the velvet of the ten-point buck grunting through   
      the underbrush 
to rut. We learned in divine time a year's a day.   
      We learned obedience 
and had charismatic children. And now the boy's an angelic 
eighteen days or six thousand years, as he leaves to serve. 
He did what we told him: blocked for punts—no one likes to   
      block for punts— 
and when his friends crashed the truck in a ditch, he waited   
      for the cops 
and took the rap, nice kid, because he did the act of deliverance   
      one does 
in central New York and made the vows, pledged, testified,   
      and swore 
and participated in the sport greater than the coming of the dead, 
and escorted the exaggerated girl to the prom where he   
      was befuddled 
with organza and tulle and he did not forget the corsage, an orchid 
in a box he stared into: the white outer whorl and the inner whorl 
and pouted purple lip. He butterflied the pollen with the lashes   
      of his eyes. 
The flower was his terror. He was not meant to be the   
      indwelling beauty 
of things and surely he was not meant to be the wind in Iraq   
      with three others 
in his division and become the abstract shape of a god formed from a blood clot. 
I've seen the pictures, the vague shapes that ripple in the heat 
until I was terrified. It looked like he still moved. Remember fall 
in Delphi? All ardent and catastrophic and counter, elbows flailing, 
he ran in the flat places scraped from the gold hills and valleys.

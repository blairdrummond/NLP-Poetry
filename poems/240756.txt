 I cut out the “Heart with Snowflake”
 Myself but it is not mine, Forget
 This bloody coat bloody shirt, I
 Think it is the writing that makes
 Me sick, The scores and scores of
 Incidental music, this nosebleed all
 Spring all wet, I’m positively angry
 with the Impertinence of it! I’m
 Sewing up the kinks in this film, I’m
 Trying to! I’m trying to burn a light
 Between, There’s a light and I cable
 my voice on it but it rips when I trace
 Anything! WORKS ON PAPER, THE SHIP
 OF DEATH “Oh build it!” Sings the
 Heart, “My coat would be so bloodied
 I could wiggle out of my coat!”

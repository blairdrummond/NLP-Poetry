title : The Memory of Elena

We spend our morning 
in the flower stalls counting 
the dark tongues of bells 
that hang from ropes waiting   
for the silence of an hour. 
We find a table, ask for paella, 
cold soup and wine, where a calm   
light trembles years behind us. 

In Buenos Aires only three 
years ago, it was the last time his hand   
slipped into her dress, with pearls   
cooling her throat and bells like 
these, chipping at the night— 

As she talks, the hollow 
clopping of a horse, the sound   
of bones touched together. 
The paella comes, a bed of rice   
and camarones, fingers and shells,   
the lips of those whose lips 
have been removed, mussels 
the soft blue of a leg socket. 

This is not paella, this is what 
has become of those who remained   
in Buenos Aires. This is the ring   
of a rifle report on the stones,   
her hand over her mouth, 
her husband falling against her. 

These are the flowers we bought   
this morning, the dahlias tossed 
on his grave and bells 
waiting with their tongues cut out   
for this particular silence.

title : Virginity

author : Anna Swir

text : 
One must be brave to live through   
a day. What remains 
is nothing but the pleasure of longing—very precious. 

Longing 
purifies as does flying, strengthens as does an effort,   
it fashions the soul 
as work 
fashions the belly. 

It is like an athlete, like a runner   
who will never 
stop running. And this 
gives him endurance. 

Longing 
is nourishing for the strong.   
It is like a window 
on a high tower, through which   
blows the wind of strength. 

Longing, 
Virginity of happiness.

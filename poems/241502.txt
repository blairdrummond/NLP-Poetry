title : Sleeping Trees

Between what should and what should not be
 Everything is liable to explode. Many times
 I was told who has no land has no sea. My father
 Learned to fly in a dream. This is the story
 Of a sycamore tree he used to climb
 When he was young to watch the rain.
  
 Sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. Like being
 Beaten with sticks. Then the mud would run red.
  
 My brother believed bad dreams could kill
A man in his sleep, he insisted
 We wake my father from his muffled screams
 On the night of the day he took us to see his village.
 No longer his village he found his tree amputated.
 Between one falling and the next
  
 There’﻿s a weightless state. There was a woman
 Who loved me. Asked me how to say tree
 In Arabic. I didn’﻿t tell her. She was sad. I didn’﻿t understand.
 When she left. I saw a man in my sleep three times. A man I knew
 Could turn anyone into one-half reptile.
 I was immune. I thought I was. I was terrified of being
  
 The only one left. When we woke my father 
 He was running away from soldiers. Now 
 He doesn’﻿t remember that night. He laughs
 About another sleep, he raised his arms to strike a king
 And tried not to stop. He flew
 But mother woke him and held him for an hour,
  
 Or half an hour, or as long as it takes a migration inward.
 Maybe if I had just said it.
 Shejerah, she would’﻿ve remembered me longer. Maybe
 I don’﻿t know much about dreams
 But my mother taught me the law of omen. The dead
 Know about the dying and sometimes
 Catch them in sleep like the sycamore tree
 My father used to climb
  
 When he was young to watch the rain stream,
 And he would gently swing.

title : The Wolves

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
at night while the dogs 
were barking 
Baby Gauge and I crawled under the fence 
with knives 
we made out like the rattlesnake melons 
were men we didn’t like 
the new moon ones were wolves 
I would cut a belly this way 
he would cut a belly that way 
the flies 
came around the sweet juice 
it was blood to us 
we tasted it we licked it off the blades 
we decided not to kill the wolves 
we wanted to be wolves 
we stuck the knives in the ground 
the moon shined on them 
we turned the pilot caps inside out 
so the fur would show 
that way when we crawled 
under the bob wire 
a little piece would get caught 
we wouldn’t though 
we wanted to leave trails 
but no scents 
we tore the melons open we licked the blood off our paws 
we wanted to be wolves 
and in the morning all those dead men 
with their hearts eat out

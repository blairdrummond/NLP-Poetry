Poems for Weddings



O quam te memorem virgo ... 
Stand on the highest pavement of the stair-- 
Lean on a garden urn-- 
Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair-- 
Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise-- 
Fling them to the ground and turn 
With a fugitive resentment in your eyes: 
But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair. 

So I would have had him leave, 
So I would have had her stand and grieve, 
So he would have left 
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised, 
As the mind deserts the body it has used. 
I should find 
Some way incomparably light and deft, 
Some way we both should understand, 
Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand. 

She turned away, but with the autumn weather 
Compelled my imagination many days, 
Many days and many hours: 
Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers. 
And I wonder how they should have been together! 
I should have lost a gesture and a pose. 
Sometimes these cogitations still amaze 
The troubled midnight and the noon's repose.

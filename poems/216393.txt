title : Ephemeroptera

author : Miriam Vermilya

text : 
On a slab of Jurassic shale, an ovate
 body, legs fine as eyelashes,
 the mayfly's precise signature,
 consummate, immortal.

 Now its descendents, in a tumult
 of mating, roil the air on Koerner's
 sluggish creek below the hill
 where the Ebenezer Baptist church,

 its doors agape, declines daily
 into dust and rubble.
 Beyond the church, the graveyard
 encroached by nightshade

 and nettle, its stones listing
 or broken or gone, a few bearing
 words now scarcely visible:
 Eliza, Beloved Wife . . . In Perpetual . . . . 

 A million years from now the stricken
 stones will be scoured clean
 and ephemerids will rise each spring
 to dance above the clouded waters.

title : Admit Possession to Rent

author : Tod Marshall

text : 
We stopped at a farmer’s house
 before parking at the dock
 that creaked over the river.
 Rowboats for rent, five bucks
 an hour, twenty for the day. 
 Deep water: I knew a canvas bag
  
 was in the trunk. I knew lunch
 would be roast beef sandwiches
 and hot stew from a thermos,
 chunks of carrot and potatoes
 cut by my mother who slept
 through the racket of our leaving.
  
 While my father paid, I loaded
 the boat with our poles
 and tackle boxes, lead sinkers
 shaped like grey pears, raincoats
 and a case of beer. I was ten
 and I knew my dad would toss
  
 that canvas bag into the aluminum
 boat with a thunk. We fish for gar
 with kittens, he’d yelled last night
 at my mother, and that was that.
 The rowboat slid from the dock,
 the occasional clunk of the first
  
 six-pack clipped on the fish stringer,
 and I knew that I should take my time
 fastening the wire leader
 to the brass swivel, tying on
 those massive sinkers. I knew 
 that the six-inch treble hook
  
 would tremble in my hands,
 and when I was done, I knew 
 what came next, a canvas bag,
 stiff kittens, blood. I tore
 two hooks through the side
 of a calico, yanked upward with a 
  
 sharp tug to lodge the third barb
 beneath the ribs. I dangled 
 my fingers in cold water
 to wash them, then reared
 the rod back into a cast that splashed
 twenty feet from the boat.
  
 He popped the third beer and finished
 baiting his hook. Too deep
 for an anchor, we drifted,
 and far beneath, the gar cruised 
 back and forth, their prehistoric 
 snouts slicing the dark, bumping
  
 our bait again and again
 until that fierce hunger I was learning
 said clamp down and take it.

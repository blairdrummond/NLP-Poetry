title : Bright Day

I sing this morning: Hello, hello.
 I proclaim the bright day of the soul.
 The sun is a good fellow,
 the devil is a good guy, no deaths today I know.
 I live because I live. I do not die because I cannot die.
 In Tuscan sunlight Masaccio
 painted his belief that St. Peter’s shadow
 cured a cripple, gave him back his sight.
 I’ve come through eighty-five summers. I walk in sunlight.
 In my garden, death questions every root, flowers reply.
 I know the dark night of the soul
 does not need God’s eye,
 as a beggar does not need a hand or a bowl.

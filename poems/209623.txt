title : Great Ships

author : Adam Zagajewski

text : 
This is a poem about the great ships that wandered 
                   the oceans 
And groaned sometimes in deep voices, grumbling about fog 
                   and submerged peaks, 
But usually they sliced the pages of tropical seas 
                   in silence, 
Divided by height, category, and class, just like our communities 
                   and hotels. 
Beneath the deck poor emigrants played cards, and no one 
                   won 
While on the highest deck Claudel gazed at Ysé and her hair 
                   glowed. 

And toasts were raised to a safe trip, to coming 
                   times, 
Toasts were raised, Alsatian wine and champagne 
                   from France's finest vineyards, 
Some days were static, windless, when only the light seeped       
                   steadily, 
Days when nothing happened but the horizon, which traveled   
                   with the ship, 
Days of emptiness and boredom, playing solitaire, repeating   
                   the latest news, 
Who'd been seen with whom in a tropical night's shade, embracing   
                   beneath a peach-colored moon. 

But filthy stokers tirelessly tossed coal into open   
                   flaming mouths 
And everything that is now already existed then, but 
                  in condensed form. 
Our days already existed and our hearts baked 
                   in the blazing stove, 
And the moment when I met you may also have existed, 
                  and my mistrust 
Brittle as a faience plate, and my faith, no less frail   
                  and capricious, 
And my searches for the final answer, my   
                disappointments and discoveries. 
      
Great ships: some sunk suddenly, arousing consciences   
                and fear, 
Gaining deathless fame, becoming stars 
                of special bulletins. 
Others went peacefully, waned without a word in provincial   
                ports, in dockyards, 
Beneath a coat of rust, a ruddy fur of rust, a slipcover of rust, 
                and waited 
For the final transformation, the last judgment of souls and 
                objects, 
They wait as patiently as chess players in Luxembourg Garden 
                nudging pieces a fraction of an inch or so.

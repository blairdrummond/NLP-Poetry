title : A Vulnerary ﻿

author : Jonathan Williams

text : 
for Robert Duncan ﻿
one comes to language from afar, the ear
 fears for its sound-barriers—
  
 but one “comes”; the language “comes” for
 The Beckoning Fair One
  
 plant you now, dig you
 later, the plaint stirs winter
 earth…
  
 air in a hornet’s nest
 over the water makes a
 solid, six-sided music…
  
 a few utterly quiet scenes, things
 are very far away—“form
 is emptiness”
  
 comely, comely, love trembles
  
 and the sweet-shrub

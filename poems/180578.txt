title : Ten Thousand to One

author : Arthur Sze

text : 
The Phoenicians guarded a recipe that required 
ten thousand murex shells to make 
an ounce of Tyrian purple. 

Scan the surface of Aldebaran with a radio wave; 
grind lapis lazuli 
into ultramarine. 

Search the summer sky for an Anasazi turkey constellation; 
see algae under an electron microscope 
resemble a Magellanic Cloud. 

A chemist tried to convert benzene into quinine, 
but blundered into a violet 
aniline dye instead. 

Have you ever seen maggots feed on a dead rat? 
Listen to a red-tailed hawk glide 
over the hushed spruce and 

pines in a canyon. Feel a drop of water roll 
down a pine needle, and glisten, 
hanging, at the tip.

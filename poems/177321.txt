title : Spider Crystal Ascension

author : Charles Wright

text : 
The spider, juiced crystal and Milky Way, drifts on his web through the night sky 
And looks down, waiting for us to ascend ... 

At dawn he is still there, invisible, short of breath, mending his net. 

All morning we look for the white face to rise from the lake like a tiny star. 
And when it does, we lie back in our watery hair and rock.

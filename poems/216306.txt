title : On the Road

Those dutiful dogtrots down airport corridors
 while gnawing at a Dunkin' Donuts cruller,
 those hotel rooms where the TV remote
 waits by the bed like a suicide pistol,
 those hours in the air amid white shirts
 whose wearers sleep-read through thick staid thrillers,
 those breakfast buffets in prairie Marriotts—
 such venues of transit grow dearer than home.

 The tricycle in the hall, the wife's hasty kiss,
 the dripping faucet and uncut lawn—this is life?
 No, vita thrives via the road, in the laptop
 whose silky screen shimmers like a dark queen's mirror,
 in the polished shoe that signifies killer intent,
 and in the solitary mission, a bumpy glide
 down through the cloud cover to a single runway
 at whose end a man just like you guards the Grail.

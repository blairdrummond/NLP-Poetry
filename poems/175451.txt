title : Native Woman

author : A. F. Moritz

Her hair back from the wide round face 
flows, almost a girl’s, so thick, 
caught back in combs, racing 
and curling through them with blackest 
vigor, although it is pure white. 
Cracked face, dusk-colored: not red 
but with a deep red struggling under 
the coming night. The eyes shift quickly, 
the subway train jerks and rattles, 
green vinyl, light flickering, silver poles. 
Eyes driven from ancient calm, 
which may fear but is never frantic 
and says nothing, such as looks out 
from the old Indian portraits—calm is 
the one thing missing from the beauty 
of her face in the black window. 
Those unresting eyes there 
talk plainly: there’s no money 
at home, men young and old go wrong, 
life almost at its end is 
still day by day harried and perplexed.

title : My Autumn Leaves

author : Bruce Weigl

text : 
I watch the woods for deer as if I’m armed. 
I watch the woods for deer who never come.   
I know the hes and shes in autumn 
rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen   
apples’ scent. I drive my car this way to work   
so I may let the crows in corn believe 
it’s me their caws are meant to warn, 
and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves 

they know me too. They know the boy 
who lives inside me still won’t go away. 
The deer are ghosts who slip between the light   
through trees, so you may only hear the snap   
of branches in the thicket beyond hope.   
I watch the woods for deer, as if I’m armed.

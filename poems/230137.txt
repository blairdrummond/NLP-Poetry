title : Deliberate

author : Amy Uyematsu

text : 
So by sixteen we move in packs 
learn to strut and slide 
in deliberate lowdown rhythm 
talk in a syn/co/pa/ted beat 
because we want so bad 
to be cool, never to be mistaken 
for white, even when we leave 
these rowdier L.A. streets— 
remember how we paint our eyes 
like gangsters 
flash our legs in nylons 
sassy black high heels 
or two inch zippered boots 
stack them by the door at night 
next to Daddy’s muddy gardening shoes.

title : Scattering the March

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
I was not beaten 
but the boy beside me was.   
He broke stride, stumbled,   
the sticks circled over him,   
corralling him into their world.   
I met his eyes and lip-read   
“run,” a whisper 
engulfed in sirens. 
       I slowed down 
in an unknown neighborhood,   
a street of watch repairers,   
tinsmiths, tailors sitting   
cross-legged in dim windows   
staring at lacquered Singers   
like men whose eyes 
are lost in a fire, 
and I ducked past them   
glancing sideways 
in deep pity because I’d been   
a step away from freedom.

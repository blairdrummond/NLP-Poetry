The ship, solid and black, 
enters the clear blackness 
of the great harbor. 
                              Quiet and cold. 
                                           --The people waiting 
are still asleep, dreaming, 
and warm, far away and still stretched out in this   
dream, perhaps . . . 

   How real our watch is, beside the dream 
of doubt the others had! How sure it is, compared 
to their troubled dream about us! 
                                                 Quiet. Silence. 
Silence which in breaking up at dawn 
will speak differently.

I 

Weed, moss-weed, 
root tangled in sand, 
sea-iris, brittle flower, 
one petal like a shell 
is broken, 
and you print a shadow 
like a thin twig. 

Fortunate one, 
scented and stinging, 
rigid myrrh-bud, 
camphor-flower, 
sweet and salt--you are wind 
in our nostrils. 
            
                        II 

Do the murex-fishers 
drench you as they pass? 
Do your roots drag up colour 
from the sand? 
Have they slipped gold under you-- 
rivets of gold? 

Band of iris-flowers 
above the waves, 
you are painted blue, 
painted like a fresh prow 
stained among the salt weeds.

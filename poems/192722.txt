title : Nineteen-Fourteen: The Soldier

author : Rupert Brooke

text : 
If I should die, think only this of me: 
      That there’s some corner of a foreign field 
That is for ever England. There shall be 
      In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; 
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, 
      Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam; 
A body of England’s, breathing English air, 
      Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. 

And think, this heart, all evil shed away, 
      A pulse in the eternal mind, no less 
            Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; 
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; 
      And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, 
            In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

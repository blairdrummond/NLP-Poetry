Rhymed Stanza

About me young careless feet
Linger along the garish street;
      Above, a hundred shouting signs
Shed down their bright fantastic glow
      Upon the merry crowd and lines
Of moving carriages below.
Oh wonderful is Broadway ? only
My heart, my heart is lonely.

Desire naked, linked with Passion,
Goes trutting by in brazen fashion;
      From playhouse, cabaret and inn
The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze
      All gay without, all glad within;
As in a dream I stand and gaze
At Broadway, shining Broadway ? only
My heart, my heart is lonely.

title : That Country

This is about the women of that country 
Sometimes they spoke in slogans 
They said 
       We patch the roads as we patch our sweetheart’s trousers   
       The heart will stop but not the transport 
They said 
       We have ensured production even near bomb craters   
       Children let your voices sing higher than the explosions 
                                                    of the bombs 
They said 
       We have important tasks to teach the children 
       that the people are the collective masters 
       to bear hardship 
       to instill love in the family 
       to guide the good health of the children (they must 
       wear clothing according to climate) 
They said 
       Once men beat their wives 
       now they may not 
       Once a poor family sold its daughter to a rich old man   
       now the young may love one another 
They said 
       Once we planted our rice any old way 
       now we plant the young shoots in straight rows 
       so the imperialist pilot can see how steady our 
       hands are 

In the evening we walked along the shores of the Lake   
                                                of the Restored Sword 

I said   is it true?   we are sisters?   
They said   Yes, we are of one family

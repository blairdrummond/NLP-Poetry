title : Translation

author : Deirdre O'Connor

text : 
Though there's no such thing as a "self," I missed it—
the fiction of it and how I felt believing in it mildly 
like a book an old love sent with an inscription 
in his hand, whatever it meant, 
After such knowledge, what forgiveness . . .  

—the script of it like the way my self felt 
learning German words by chance—Mitgefühl, 
Unheimlichkeit—and the trailing off that happened 
because I knew only the feelings, abstract 
and international, like ghosts or connotations 
lacking a grammar, a place to go: 

this was the way my self felt when it started 
falling apart: each piece of it clipped 
from a garden vaguely remembered 
by somebody unrecognizable—
such a strange bouquet that somebody sent 
to nobody else, a syntax of blossoms.

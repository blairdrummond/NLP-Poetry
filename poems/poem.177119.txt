Because I could not stop for Death - (479) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Living, Death



Because I could not stop for Death - 
He kindly stopped for me - 
The Carriage held but just Ourselves - 
And Immortality. 

We slowly drove - He knew no haste 
And I had put away 
My labor and my leisure too, 
For His Civility - 

We passed the School, where Children strove 
At Recess - in the Ring - 
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain - 
We passed the Setting Sun - 

Or rather - He passed Us - 
The Dews drew quivering and Chill - 
For only Gossamer, my Gown - 
My Tippet - only Tulle - 

We paused before a House that seemed 
A Swelling of the Ground - 
The Roof was scarcely visible - 
The Cornice - in the Ground - 

Since then - 'tis Centuries - and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
I first surmised the Horses' Heads 
Were toward Eternity -

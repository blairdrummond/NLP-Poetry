title : The Air Base at Châteauroux, France

text : 
In the American schoolyard   
where we lunged headfirst   
onto the rocky ground scrab- 
bling for a ball 
                         as if 
for love, the crossed chalk- 
line still electrified our 
tough boyish hearts, and no   
one much cared 
                      for such 
exotic gods as loomed up   
out of the Palatine Hills 
in the required guidebooks   
dumped in heaps 
                        behind our 
makeshift goal. We knew   
what we knew. Sweatstains   
darkened our blue school   
shirts while 
                   our fathers’   
fighters strafed the mock- 
ups in the practice fields,   
never far enough from town   
it didn’t thunder 
                           all day 
through the blackened   
cottages’ stony stares locked   
up tight behind their shot   
bolts; nor through 
                            the evening, 
either, when drifting home,   
stripped to the waist, we’d   
dance feet-chalked across   
the marketplace 
                        like young, 
uneasy gods, a little drunk   
on our shame, our power.

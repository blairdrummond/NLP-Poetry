title : The Fearful Child

author : Carol Frost

As a child I parleyed with animals, stuffed and real. 
Making my kitten pilot of a boot, I guided 
from one end of a string the dizzy flight and collapse. 
I was fearful of people as well as things, 
and my faithful toy shepherd with his painted face 
sat by me on the bed in the gloom. 
I was disdainful of dolls as weak people. 

In the favorite story I told myself my parents 
were made over into fair-limbed, brave angels 
who smiled into their god’s eyes when summoned. 
I was benevolent, afraid to let go of this image 
at night because I couldn’t hide deep enough 
under the covers to be overlooked by death, 
the angel bending over me who had been wronged. 

I read histories of queens, regal and barbarian, 
whose leopard’s eyes restrained man or wild beast. 
I rambled along tidal rivers and in the marshes 
where the green-golden grasses dazzled the sun, 
and felt the ache of sea-air in my lungs. 
I saw water spume near Atlantic cliffs. 
I examined lichen. I saw great light drown darkness. 

Then at thirteen I lay in the bleak bed before sleep 
and heard the pleadings and the murderous kisses; 
and burned, like a bear his fat, my soul. 
I quaked at the sound of my voice whispering, No, 
or turned my face to the wall 
and wept salt onto my knuckles. 

In the serene light of sun-up, before sparrows 
tumbled up from the earth, whispering and singing, 
and the exquisite sea and sky mobilized 
their heavy, blue currents, I was consoled. 
I walked through beauty without knowing why 
and told no one, wanting nothing else to touch me 
and never to move anyone in any way. 

I hid away from the house and learned the dark 
was not a dream but could show the pale gravel 
of a real driveway. I saw for the first time 
later the new moon and the full moon 
in one piece. I no longer feared the night, 
night like a bear at ease in his wide habitat. 
In the greatness of such space I said, This is me.

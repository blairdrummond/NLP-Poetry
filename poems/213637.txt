The world’s a world of trouble, your mother must   
                      have told you   
               that. Poison leaks into the basements 

and tedium into the schools. The oak   
                      is going the way 
               of the elm in the upper Midwest—my cousin 

earns a living by taking the dead ones   
                      down. 
               And Jason’s alive yet, the fair- 

haired child, his metal crib next   
                      to my daughter’s. 
             Jason is one but last saw light five months ago 

and won’t see light again. 

                                                  ·  

Leaf against leaf without malice   
                     or forethought, 
            the manifold species of murmuring 

harm. No harm intended, there never is.   
                     The new 
            inadequate software gets the reference librarian 

fired. The maintenance crew turns off power one            
                     weekend 
            and Monday the lab is a morgue: fifty-four 

rabbits and seventeen months of research.   
                     Ignorance loves   
          as ignorance does and always 

holds high office.   

                                                  · 

Jason had the misfortune to suffer misfortune   
                   the third 
          of July. July’s the month of hospital ro- 

tations; on holiday weekends the venerable   
                   stay home. 
          So when Jason lay blue and inert on the table 

and couldn’t be made to breathe for three-and-a- 
                  quarter hours,   
         the staff were too green to let him go. 

The household gods have abandoned us to the gods   
                  of juris- 
         prudence and suburban sprawl. The curve 

of new tarmac, the municipal pool,   
                  the sky at work 
         on the pock-marked river, fatuous sky, 

the park where idling cars, mere yards   
                  from the slide 
         and the swingset, deal beautiful oblivion in nickel 

bags: the admitting room and its stately drive,   
                  possessed   
         of the town’s best view. 

                                                 · 

And what’s to become of the three-year-old brother?   
                  When Jason was found   
         face down near the dogdish—it takes 

just a cupful of water to drown— 
                   his brother stood still 
         in the corner and said he was hungry 

and said that it wasn’t his fault.   
                  No fault. 
         The fault’s in nature, who will 

without system or explanation   
                make permanent 
         havoc of little mistakes. A natural 

mistake, the transient ill-will we define   
                as the normal 
         and trust to be inconsequent, 

by nature’s own abundance soon absorbed.   

                                                   · 

Oak wilt, it’s called, the new disease.   
                Like any such 
         contagion—hypocrisy in the conference room, 

flattery in the halls—it works its mischief mostly   
                unremarked.   
         The men on the links haven’t noticed 

yet. Their form is good. They’re par.   
                The woman who’s 
         prospered from hating ideas loves causes 

instead. A little shade, a little firewood.   
                I know 
         a stand of oak on which my father’s 

earthly joy depends. We’re slow   
                to cut our losses.

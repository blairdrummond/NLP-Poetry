WHO MADE LOVE TO ME, IMAGIN'D MORE THAN WOMAN
Fair lovely Maid, or if that Title be 
Too weak, too Feminine for Nobler thee, 
Permit a Name that more Approaches Truth: 
And let me call thee, Lovely Charming Youth. 
This last will justifie my soft complainte, 
While that may serve to lessen my constraint; 
And without Blushes I the Youth persue, 
When so much beauteous Woman is in view 
Against thy Charms we struggle but in vain 
With thy deluding Form thou giv'st us pain, 
While the bright Nymph betrays us to the Swain. 
In pity to our Sex sure thou wer't sent, 
That we might Love, and yet be Innocent: 
For sure no Crime with thee we can commit; 
Or if we shou'd - thy Form excuses it. 
For who, that gathers fairest Flowers believes 
A Snake lies hid beneath the Fragrant Leaves. 

    Thou beauteous Wonder of a different kind, 
Soft Cloris with the dear Alexis join'd; 
When e'er the Manly part of thee, wou'd plead 
Thou tempts us with the Image of the Maid, 
While we the noblest Passions do extend 
The Love to Hermes, Aphrodite the Friend.

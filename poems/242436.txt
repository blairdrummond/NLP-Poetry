text : 
For I have seen love
 and his face is choice Heart of Hearts,
 a flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center
 where all Motion is one.
  
 And I have known
 despair that the Face has ceased to stare 
 at me with the Rose of the world
 but lies furled
  
 in an artificial paradise it is Hell to get into.
 If I knew you were there
 I would fall upon my knees and plead to God
 to deliver you in my arms once again.
  
 But it is senseless to try.
 One can only take means to reduce misery,
 confuse the sensations so that this Face,
 what aches in the heart and makes each new
  
 start less close to the source of desire,
 fade from the flesh that fires the night,
 with dreams and infinite longing.

"Oh! for a thousand tongues to sing 
   My great Redeemer's praise: 
The glories of my Lord and King, 
   The triumphs of His grace." 

Oh! for a thousand cedar posts 
   To fence my garden 'round. 
To hinder the neighbors' pigs and goats 
   From rooting up my potato ground. 

Oh! for a thousand hickory rails, 
   To make my fence secure; 
A thousand patent locks and keys, 
   To lock my stable door. 

Oh! for a thousand bricks and stones, 
   To build my chimney higher, 
To keep the neighbors' boys and girls 
   From putting out my fire. 

Oh! for a thousand old shot guns, 
   That I might be a match, 
For all the tramps that I can find 
   In my watermelon patch. 

Oh! for a thousand pumpkin seeds, 
   To plant for my son John; 
He says that pumpkin pies are good 
   When the winter time comes on. 

Oh! for a thousand cribs of corn, 
   Filled chuck up to the beam; 
And a thousand pails that's good and strong, 
   To keep the milk and cream. 

Oh! for a thousand turnip bads, 
   Placed all into a row; 
Lord! please send a little rain, 
   To make the 'tatoes grow. 

Oh! for a thousand tongues to ask 
   My maker, who's on high, 
To keep my smoke-house filled with meal, 
   Fat bacon, rock and rye. 

Now, Lord, I close my humble prayer, 
   Which (to some) may seem a vision; 
Numbers ask for all I've named, 
   Whilst few ask for RELIGION.

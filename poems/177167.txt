The back, the yoke, the yardage. Lapped seams, 
The nearly invisible stitches along the collar 
Turned in a sweatshop by Koreans or Malaysians 

Gossiping over tea and noodles on their break 
Or talking money or politics while one fitted 
This armpiece with its overseam to the band 

Of cuff I button at my wrist. The presser, the cutter, 
The wringer, the mangle. The needle, the union, 
The treadle, the bobbin. The code. The infamous blaze 

At the Triangle Factory in nineteen-eleven. 
One hundred and forty-six died in the flames 
On the ninth floor, no hydrants, no fire escapes— 

The witness in a building across the street 
Who watched how a young man helped a girl to step 
Up to the windowsill, then held her out 

Away from the masonry wall and let her drop. 
And then another. As if he were helping them up 
To enter a streetcar, and not eternity. 

A third before he dropped her put her arms   
Around his neck and kissed him. Then he held 
Her into space, and dropped her. Almost at once 

He stepped to the sill himself, his jacket flared 
And fluttered up from his shirt as he came down, 
Air filling up the legs of his gray trousers— 

Like Hart Crane’s Bedlamite, “shrill shirt ballooning.” 
Wonderful how the pattern matches perfectly 
Across the placket and over the twin bar-tacked 

Corners of both pockets, like a strict rhyme 
Or a major chord.   Prints, plaids, checks, 
Houndstooth, Tattersall, Madras. The clan tartans 

Invented by mill-owners inspired by the hoax of Ossian, 
To control their savage Scottish workers, tamed 
By a fabricated heraldry: MacGregor, 

Bailey, MacMartin. The kilt, devised for workers 
To wear among the dusty clattering looms. 
Weavers, carders, spinners. The loader, 

The docker, the navvy. The planter, the picker, the sorter 
Sweating at her machine in a litter of cotton 
As slaves in calico headrags sweated in fields: 

George Herbert, your descendant is a Black 
Lady in South Carolina, her name is Irma 
And she inspected my shirt. Its color and fit 

And feel and its clean smell have satisfied 
Both her and me. We have culled its cost and quality 
Down to the buttons of simulated bone, 

The buttonholes, the sizing, the facing, the characters 
Printed in black on neckband and tail. The shape, 
The label, the labor, the color, the shade. The shirt.

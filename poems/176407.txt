title : The Right Whale in Iowa

author : Debora Greger

text : 
The shag rug of a Great Plains buffalo,   
      a flightless bird 
gone to stone: over its fellow keepsakes, 

      into the archives of air, 
the whale hauled a harvest of dust.   
      In the ripples of glass 

sealed over songbird skins, I wavered.   
      What could be said for love? 
From the Full-Serv to the Self-Serv Island 

      at the Gulf station next door, 
landlocked waves shivered in a row of corn.   
      The great flukes lifted. 

A Milky Way scarred the underside more vast   
      than the Midwestern night.   
Dark cargoes would give themselves up 

      to these shallows 
that waited to take home the sailor,   
      home to the sea 

of fossilized coral upon whose shoals   
      just down the road   
the motels of Coralville lay sprawled. 

      Here would lie a ring 
scratched by a scrivener with florid hand,   
      In thy breast my heart does rest 

flung back to shore, here rest two coins   
      face to face, joined   
by the salt that turned them faceless 

      as they turned to each other.

Delia 45: Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night

Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night, 
Brother to Death, in silent darkness born: 
Relieve my languish, and restore the light, 
With dark forgetting of my cares, return; 
And let the day be time enough to mourn 
The shipwreck of my ill-adventur'd youth: 
Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn, 
Without the torment of the night's untruth. 
Cease dreams, th' imagery of our day-desires, 
To model forth the passions of the morrow; 
Never let rising sun approve you liars, 
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow. 
Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain; 
And never wake to feel the day's disdain.

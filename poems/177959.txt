title : Ralegh’s Prizes

author : Robert Pinsky

text : 
And Summer turns her head with its dark tangle   
All the way toward us; and the trees are heavy,   
With little sprays of limp green maple and linden   
Adhering after a rainstorm to the sidewalk   
Where yellow pollen dries in pools and runnels. 

Along the oceanfront, pink neon at dusk: 
The long, late dusk, a light wind from the water   
Lifting a girl’s hair forward against her cheek 
And swaying a chain of bulbs. 
                                              In luminous booths, 
The bright, traditional wheel is on its ratchet, 
And ticking gaily at its little pawl; 
And the surf revolves; and passing cars and people, 
Their brilliant colors—all strange and hopeful as Ralegh’s   
Trophies: the balsam, the prizes of untried virtue,   
Bananas and armadillos that a Captain 
Carries his Monarch from another world.

Written in Germany
   If I had but two little wings
      And were a little feathery bird,
         To you I'd fly, my dear!
But thoughts like these are idle things,
         And I stay here.

   But in my sleep to you I fly:
      I'm always with you in my sleep!
         The world is all one's own.
But then one wakes, and where am I?
         All, all alone.

   Sleep stays not, though a monarch bids:
      So I love to wake ere break of day:
         For though my sleep be gone,
Yet while 'tis dark, one shuts one's lids,
         And still dreams on.

(lines 71-99)
Frost shall freeze 
                  fire eat wood   
earth shall breed 
                  ice shall bridge   
water a shield wear. 
                  One shall break   
frost’s fetters 
                  free the grain   
from wonder-lock 
                  —One who all can. 

Winter shall wane 
                  fair weather come again 
the sun-warmed summer!   
                  The sound unstill   
the deep dead wave 
                  is darkest longest.   
Holly shall to the pyre 
                  hoard be scattered   
when the body’s numb. 
                  Name is best. 

A king shall win 
                  a queen with goods   
beakers, bracelets. 
                  Both must first 
be kind with gifts. 
                  Courage must wax   
war-mood in the man, 
                  the woman grow up   
beloved among her people,   
                  be light of mood 
hold close a rune-word 
                  be roomy-hearted 
at hoard-share and horse-giving. 
                  When the hall drinks   
she shall always and everywhere 
                  before any company   
greet first 
                  the father of aethelings   
with the first draught 
                  —deft to his hand she   
holds the horn— 
                  and when they are at home together   
know the right way 
                  to run their household. 

The ship must be nailed 
                  the shield framed 
from the light linden. 
                  But how loving the welcome   
of the Frisian wife 
                  when floats offshore 
the keel come home again! 
                  She calls him within walls, 

her own husband 
                  —hull’s at anchor!— 
washes salt-stains 
                  from his stiff shirt   
brings out clothes 
                  clean and fresh 
for her lord on land again. 
                  Love’s need is met.

 Gently disintegrate me
 Said nothing at all.
  
 Is there still time to say
 Said I myself lying
 In a bower of bramble
 Into which I have fallen.
  
 Look through my eyes up
 At blue with not anything
 We could have ever arranged
 Slowly taking place.
  
 Above the spires of the fox
 Gloves and above the bracken
 Tops with their young heads
 Recognising the wind,
 The armies of the empty
 Blue press me further
 Into Zennor Hill.
  
 If I half-close my eyes
 The spiked light leaps in
 And I am here as near
 Happy as I will get
 In the sailing afternoon.

 Enter a cloud. Between
 The head of Zennor and 
 Gurnard’s Head the long
 Marine horizon makes 
 A blue wall or is it
 A distant table-top
 Of the far-off simple sea.
  
 Enter a cloud. O cloud,
 I see you entering from 
 Your west gathering yourself
 Together into a white
 Headlong. And now you move
 And stream out of the Gurnard,
 The west corner of my eye.
  
 Enter a cloud. The cloud’s 
 Changing shape is crossing
 Slowly only an inch
 Above the line of the sea.
 Now nearly equidistant
 Between Zennor and Gurnard’s
 Head, an elongated
 White anvil is sailing
 Not wanting to be a symbol.

 Said nothing at all.
  
 And proceeds with no idea
 Of destination along
 The sea bearing changing
 Messages. Jean in London,
 Lifting a cup, looking
 Abstractedly out through
 Her Hampstead glass will never
 Be caught by your new shape
 Above the chimneys. Jean,
 Jean, do you not see
 This cloud has been thought of
 And written on Zennor Hill.

The cloud is going beyond
What I can see or make.
Over up-country maybe
Albert Strick stops and waves
Caught in the middle of teeling
Broccoli for the winter.
The cloud is not there yet.

From Gurnard's Head to Zennor
Head the level line
Crosses my eyes lying
On buzzing Zennor Hill.

The cloud is only a wisp
And gone behind the Head.
It is funny I got the sea's
Horizontal slightly surrealist.
Now when I raise myself
Out of the bracken I see
The long empty blue
Between the fishing Gurnard
And Zennor. It was a cloud
The language at my time's
Disposal made use of.

Thank you. And for your applause.
It has been a pleasure. I
Have never enjoyed speaking more.
May I also thank the real ones
Who have made this possible.
First, the cloud itself. And now
Gurnard's Head and Zennor
Head. Also recognise
How I have been helped
By Jean and Madron's Albert
Strick (He is a real man.)
And good words like brambles,
Bower, spiked, fox, anvil, teeling.

The bees you heard are from
A hive owned by my friend
Garfield down there below
In the house by Zennor Church.

The good blue sun is pressing
Me into Zennor Hill.

Gently disintegrate me
Said nothing at all.

title : Stravinsky in L.A.

In white pleated trousers, peering through green 
sunshades, looking for the way the sun is red 
noise, how locusts hiss to replicate the sun. 
What is the visual equivalent 
of syncopation? Rows of seared palms wrinkle 
in the heat waves through green glass. Sprinklers 
tick, tick, tick. The Watts Towers aim to split 
the sky into chroma, spires tiled with rubble 
nothing less than aspiration. I’ve left 
minarets for sun and syncopation, 
sixty-seven shades of green which I have 
counted, beginning: palm leaves, front and back, 
luncheon pickle, bottle glass, etcetera. 
One day I will comprehend the different   
grades of red. On that day I will comprehend 
these people, rhythms, jazz, Simon Rodia, 
Watts, Los Angeles, aspiration.

title : Minding Rites

author : David Yezzi

This guy I know, a rabbi, Friday nights, 
on his way home before sunset in winter, 
always stops at a florist or bodega 
and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife.

Every week the same, a ritual, 
regardless of her mood that morning, fresh 
upsets at work, or snarling on the bridge; 
he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane.

But isn’t there a ring of hokiness 
in that? Why should a good man have to show 
his devotion? Some things go unspoken; 
some things get tested on the real world,

and isn’t that the place that matters most? 
So when you told me I should bring you flowers, 
I joked, “But don’t I show my feelings more 
in dog walks, diapers, and rewiring lamps?”

The flowers, I learned later, weren’t for wooing,
not for affection in long marriage, but
for something seeded even deeper down,
through frost heaves, and which might be, roughly, peace.

(It’s funny that I just assumed romance.) 
Now there’s no peace with us. I wonder what 
they might have meant to you, those simple tokens, 
holding in sight what no rite can grow back.

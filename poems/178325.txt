title : Fundamentalism

text : 
Because the eye has a short shadow or 
it is hard to see over heads in the crowd? 

If everyone else seems smarter   
but you need your own secret? 

If mystery was never your friend? 

If one way could satisfy 
the infinite heart of the heavens? 

If you liked the king on his golden throne 
more than the villagers carrying baskets of lemons? 

If you wanted to be sure 
his guards would admit you to the party? 

            The boy with the broken pencil   
            scrapes his little knife against the lead   
            turning and turning it as a point   
            emerges from the wood again 

            If he would believe his life is like that   
            he would not follow his father into war

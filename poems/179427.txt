title : Long Finger Poem

author : Jin Eun-Young

text : 
I'm working on my poems and working with   
my fingers not my head. Because my fingers 

are the farthest stretching things from me. 
Look at the tree. Like its longest branch 

I touch the evening's quiet breathing. Sounds   
of rain. The crackling heat from other trees. 

The tree points everywhere. The branches can't   
reach to their roots though. Growing longer they 

grow weaker also. Can't make use of water. 
Rain falls. But I'm working with these farthest stretching 

things from me. Along my fingertips bare shoots   
of days then years unfurl in the cold air.

title : Writing a Sand Thinking

author : Steve McCaffery

text : 
After the gossip one returns to grammar.
 Almost to say that speech
                                         compares us
 renting that   as a fact the case stands firm
              for what we own.
                                                     Pragma
 by relations instance this as
               the index of my slab.  Your
 slap at it.
                             The clouds pastiche aubade
 Sid’s bakery delivers                                symmetry
 inside an adult formula for
 Saturdays. Our poppies
 in history.

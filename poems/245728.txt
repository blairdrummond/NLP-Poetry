title : The Totality of Facts

author : Allan Peterson

text : 
The laughing gull that flew behind the fencepost
 and never came out was the beginning
 and then a hand smaller than my hand covered Wisconsin
 with a gesture for explanation.
 In the afternoon there are pauses between the words
 through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane.
 A fish with an osprey in its back emerges from the Sound
 and nothing can be learned by more analysis.
 The book of her hair opens to its binding and I leaf through
 the glorious pages of appreciation and that’s not all.
 We could not have turned fast enough to catch
 light and leftovers from so much of what happened:
 the swift figures behind you like a planet’s dark
 companion, ships entering and leaving the hall closet
 the real and imagined between which is no difference.

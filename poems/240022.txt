title : Sign for My Father, Who Stressed the Bunt

author : David Bottoms

On the rough diamond,
 the hand-cut field below the dog lot and barn,
 we rehearsed the strict technique
 of bunting. I watched from the infield,
 the mound, the backstop
 as your left hand climbed the bat, your legs
 and shoulders squared toward the pitcher.
 You could drop it like a seed
 down either base line. I admired your style,
 but not enough to take my eyes off the bank
 that served as our center-field fence.
  
 Years passed, three leagues of organized ball,
 no few lives. I could homer 
 into the left-field lot of Carmichael Motors,
 and still you stressed the same technique,
 the crouch and spring, the lead arm absorbing
 just enough impact. That whole tiresome pitch
 about basics never changing,
 and I never learned what you were laying down.
  
 Like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap,
 let this be the sign 
 I’m getting a grip on the sacrifice.

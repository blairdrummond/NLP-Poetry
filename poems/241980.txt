title : The Truly Great

author : Stephen Spender

text : 
I think continually of those who were truly great.
 Who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history
 Through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,
 Endless and singing. Whose lovely ambition
 Was that their lips, still touched with fire,
 Should tell of the Spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.
 And who hoarded from the Spring branches
 The desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.
  
 What is precious, is never to forget
 The essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs
 Breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.
 Never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light
 Nor its grave evening demand for love.
 Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
 With noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.
  
 Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,
 See how these names are fêted by the waving grass
 And by the streamers of white cloud
 And whispers of wind in the listening sky.
 The names of those who in their lives fought for life,
 Who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre.
 Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun
 And left the vivid air signed with their honour.

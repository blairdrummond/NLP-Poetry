The men don’t know growls
 Willie Dixon’s most famous tune, but
 the version I prefer—low fidelity
 cassette bootleg, howling tin sound with
 shredded paper drums—remains
 unreleased, recorded not by some venerable
 Mississippi blues curmudgeon
 whose name, artfully dropped here,
 would evoke afternoons porch-sitting
 with magnolia wine and box-string guitar,
 or might bestow upon me
 some sorely lacking hipster bonafides.
 That’s never going to happen,
 since I am talking here
 about a nearly unlistenable cover,
 the monophonic noise and mid-range screech
 of The Knack, live in Hollywood,
 before a packed house at the Troubador,
 July 1979. So what if I was twelve?
 I’d already gotten it, learned how to pluck
 out the gallop of My Sharona’s bass,
 hoping someday I’d ace out Doug Fieger
 and be Sharona’s back door man
 myself, though I’d have been better off
 learning how to get in the front door first.
 Which was the vaguest country,
 women, or the blues? I did not know.
 I still might not. I only knew
 what I was learning: that a song
 could actually sound like sweat;
 that Ray Manzarek, gangly Ray best known
 as the piano-playing witness to greatness,
 had dropped by to sit in,
 and when he’d come down Wonderland Avenue
 it was a benediction, as if to say, Hey,
 these guys are all right, forgive them
 their sins of leather tie and Beatle boot.
 So I want to say thank you
 to whatever thought to tape that show,
 because it taught me that I wanted a forever
 girl like Sharona, who,
 as the 45-rpm picture sleeve promised,
 played the coolest records
 for her slumber-partying girlfriends,
 who all looked like the camisoled girls
 in the Runaways or the equally fated Go-Gos.
 But I am getting ahead of myself, since,
 as Leonard Cohen says, everybody knows
 how this story ends. I have everything
 The Knack ever recorded, including
 this version of Back Door Man,
 which tells me everything that was wrong
 with 1979, and later, everything wrong with me.
 How does the show end? Listen
 to the cassette, a moment in unsteady time,
 the Zapruder film of the skinny tie era.
 For the band, you know how it ends
 already: rehab, divorce, rehab, forgiveness,
 comeback tour, state fair nostalgia;
 immortal Sharona—her real name
 —sells real estate, million-dollar homes.
 That’s what those little girls do,
 they grow up, which reminds me
 My Sharona, that set-closing number,
 may be the saddest story I know.

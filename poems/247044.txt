1. deathbed

There is a word that is not water, 
has nothing to do with heat or light, 
is unrelated to any one pain 
though the torn body tears itself further 
trying to speak it.
                                  There is a sound 
beyond all the sounds that I have made, 
the needs that one by one I've tried to name. 
It burns clear in the eyes searching mine, 
the lips beginning to bleed again, 
her hand squeezing my hand, 
pleading and pleading that I understand.


2. living will

All afternoon in the afterlife 
of little things that love,
 or pain, or need could not let go of
 I hunt for the will
 that will let me let you go.

I am distracted and slow—
all the grainy faces
 in old photographs, letters 
from the dead, deeds to places 
that are only air,

 some bright nowhere 
of broad fields and sunlight 
that was my idea of heaven 
one long afternoon 
of clouds and steady rain

 when you sat and explained 
where a garden was, a well, 
excited by it, the hell 
ahead of you 
just a brief tightness at your heart.

 Outside in the yard, crickets start, 
cry here and here and here, 
night's thousand shadows growing tall.
 And now I have it, formal, final. 
I touch each keepsake like a wall.


3. going

In the hard light and hum
 of the room to which I've come
 to stay, I watch the clock,
 and wait, and hour by hour
 begin to disappear.
 Movements, mutterings: the brain
 darkens like a landscape. Pain
 in the pale arterial hills
 flashes and vanishes,
 takes with it one whole year.
 Cotton and killdeer, a cloud
 looks down, something's happened
 in the wellhouse, someone runs
 through tall trees, breathe and breathe,
 is it my hand you hold?
 The fever climbs. You grow cold,
 then warm, now cold again,
 a hive of nerves in the skin.
 Some glimmer breaks through
 and I bend whispering as fear
 like a wind shakes you,
 I'm right here, I'm right here...

 Midnight, moonlight gauzing 
the walls, the iron and umber 
of intensive care: 
I watch as it swells and falls 
the puttied scar at your heart, 
and read each beat and falter 
on a screen and match my breathing 
to the breathing of a machine 
to know this time as it passes, 
each moment as it goes— 
until, early, you shudder 
and quieten, blood gases 
begin to rapidly rise 
and somewhere behind your eyes 
I fall in fragments away: 
a child surprised at his play, 
encroached upon by air, 
a shattered man near dawn, 
something about the way 
he holds so still, his hair.

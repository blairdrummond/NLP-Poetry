I. – THE FIRST FUNERAL            
  
 (The first corpse I saw was on the 
 German wires, and couldn’t be buried)
  
 The whole field was so smelly;
     We smelt the poor dog first:
 His horrid swollen belly 
     Looked just like going burst.
  
 His fur was most untidy;
     He hadn’t any eyes.
 It happened on Good Friday
     And there was lots of flies.
  
 And then I felt the coldest
     I’d ever felt, and sick,
 But Rose, ’cause she’s the oldest,
     Dared poke him with her stick.
  
 He felt quite soft and horrid:
     The flies buzzed round his head
 And settled on his forehead:
     Rose whispered: ‘That dog’s dead.
  
 ‘You bury all dead people,
     When they’re quite really dead,
 Round churches with a steeple:
     Let’s bury this,’ Rose said.
  
 ‘And let’s put mint all round it
     To hide the nasty smell.’
 I went to look and found it—
     Lots, growing near the well.
  
 We poked him through the clover
     Into a hole, and then
 We threw brown earth right over
     And said: ‘Poor dog, Amen!’

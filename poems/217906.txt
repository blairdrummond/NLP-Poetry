title : Kind of Blue

text : 
Not Delft or   
delphinium, not Wedgewood 
among the knickknacks, not wide-eyed chicory   
evangelizing in the devil strip— 

But way on down in the moonless   
octave below midnight, honey, 
way down where you can't tell cerulean   
from teal. 

Not Mason jars of moonshine, not   
waverings of silk, not the long-legged hunger   
of a heron or the peacock's   
iridescent id— 

But Delilahs of darkness, darling, 
and the muscle of the mind 
giving in. 

Not sullen snow slumped   
against the garden, not the first instinct of flame,   
not small, stoic ponds, or the cold derangement 
of a jealous sea— 

But bluer than the lips of Lazarus, baby,   
before Sweet Jesus himself could figure out 
what else in the world to do but weep.

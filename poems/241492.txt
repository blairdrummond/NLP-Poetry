     1
 And goes is gone
 cause for mourning head
 in hands in tears gonna be a long long wait for the resurrection
 of the dead.
  
 There are birds there is birdsong
 unmourning and unmournful at sunrise in the white light
 there is a garden with high walls around it
 jardin de plaisir
 of mint and lavender of hyssop in hedges glassy beads of water on velvet leaves
 purple-flaked lupin spikes above velvet pulmonaria
 there is a gardener la belle jardinière bare-breasted and bare-footed
 bouquets
 of all flowers in her arms and woven in her hair.

 And it hurts not good but
 bad
 to see a man head in hands in tears it breaks you up
 to see a man come down in tears.
  
 There are birds there is birdsong
 having come through hunger and danger
 there is free song
 a free weaving of many songs
 song against song and other songs clustered/spun out in a blending of wavy pitches
 tant
 doucement the phrase means what the songs mean
 freshness
 that meaning so sweetly and freely as a gardener weaves flowers in her hair.
  
      3
 Can we stay in the weave of
 that meaning can we/should we attempt to stay to linger
 in a pleasure garden everlasting dream of
 love tomorrow its unseen/secret structure when our time remains a 
 bad time and what time wasn’﻿﻿t 
 bad
 wasn’﻿﻿t and isn’﻿﻿t a time of hunger and danger of young men and older men
 in tears our time a time
 of terror and counterterror can
 we/should
 we our
 time remaining a really bad time a really down and dirty time
 of terror what
 walls do not fall and who says they have no fear.

 And boo-hoo-hoo
 like dolls
 hurts breaks you up like dolls get broken the visible human
 the visibly spastic plastic.
  
 There are birds there is birdsong
 unmourning and unmournful having come through
 there is a garden with swept gravel paths
 dream designed/bel et bon designed connecting and interconnecting
 non brisé﻿
 where men and women are in contemplation in conversation in 
 one another’﻿﻿s eyes
 there is a gardener holding her bouquets and holding her skirts like the light like
 so sweetly woven song like love never for sale.

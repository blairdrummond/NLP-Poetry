Rhymed Stanza

"O Love, thou art winged and swift, 
   Yet stay with me evermore!" 
And I guarded my house with bolt and bar 
   Lest Love fly forth at the door. 

Without, in the world, 't was cold, 
   While Love and I together 
Laughed and sang by my red hearth-fire,   
   Nor knew it was winter weather. 

Sweet Love would lull me to sleep,   
   In his tireless arm caressed; 
His shadowing wings and burning eyes 
   Like night and stars wrought rest. 

And ever the beat of Love's heart 
   As a chime rang at my ear; 
And ever Love's bending, beautiful face 
   Covered me close from fear. 

Was it long ere I waked alone? 
   A snow-drift whitened the floor;   
I saw spent ashes upon my hearth 
   And Death in my open door.

title : The Hurt Locker

author : Brian Turner

text : 
Nothing but hurt left here.
 Nothing but bullets and pain
 and the bled-out slumping
 and all the fucks and goddamns
 and Jesus Christs of the wounded.
 Nothing left here but the hurt.
  
 Believe it when you see it.
 Believe it when a twelve-year-old
 rolls a grenade into the room.
 Or when a sniper punches a hole
 deep into someone’s skull.
 Believe it when four men
 step from a taxicab in Mosul
 to shower the street in brass
 and fire. Open the hurt locker
 and see what there is of knives
 and teeth. Open the hurt locker and learn
 how rough men come hunting for souls.

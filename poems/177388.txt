—Barrio René Cisneros Managua, Nicaragua, June-July 1982
This was the dictator’s land 
before the revolution. 
Now the dictator is exiled to necropolis, 
his army brooding in camps on the border, 
and the congregation of the landless 
stipples the earth with a thousand shacks, 
every weatherbeaten carpenter 
planting a fistful of nails. 

Here I dig latrines. I dig because last week 
I saw a funeral in the streets of Managua, 
the coffin swaddled in a red and black flag, 
hoisted by a procession so silent 
that even their feet seemed 
to leave no sound on the gravel. 
He was eighteen, with the border patrol, 
when a sharpshooter from the dictator’s army 
took aim at the back of his head. 

I dig because yesterday 
I saw four walls of photographs: 
the faces of volunteers 
in high school uniforms 
who taught campesinos to read, 
bringing an alphabet 
sandwiched in notebooks 
to places where the mist never rises 
from the trees. All dead, 
by malaria or the greedy river 
or the dictator’s army 
swarming the illiterate villages 
like a sky full of corn-plundering birds. 

I dig because today, in this barrio 
without plumbing, I saw a woman 
wearing a yellow dress 
climb into a barrel of water 
to wash herself and the dress 
at the same time, 
her cupped hands spilling. 

I dig because today I stopped digging 
to drink an orange soda. In a country 
with no glass, the boy kept the treasured bottle 
and poured the liquid into a plastic bag 
full of ice, then poked a hole with a straw. 

I dig because today my shovel 
struck a clay bowl centuries old, 
the art of ancient fingers 
moist with this same earth, 
perfect but for one crack in the lip. 

I dig because I have hauled garbage 
and pumped gas and cut paper 
and sold encyclopedias door to door. 
I dig, digging until the passport 
in my back pocket saturates with dirt, 
because here I work for nothing 
and for everything.

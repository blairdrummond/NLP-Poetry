Villanelle

Since Persia fell at Marathon,
      The yellow years have gathered fast:
Long centuries have come and gone.

And yet (they say) the place will don
      A phantom fury of the past,
Since Persia fell at Marathon;

And as of old, when Helicon
      Trembled and swayed with rapture vast
(Long centuries have come and gone),

This ancient plain, when night comes on,
      Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,
Since Persia fell at Marathon.

But into soundless Acheron
      The glory of Greek shame was cast:
Long centuries have come and gone,

The suns of Hellas have all shone,
      The first has fallen to the last:?
Since Persia fell at Marathon,
Long centuries have come and gone.

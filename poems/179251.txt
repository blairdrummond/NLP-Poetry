title : Love Pirates

text : 
I follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle   
under your shoulder, lean over your back, breathing   
into your hair and thinking of nothing. I want 
to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop   
and drift away from all of it, our two cars rusting 
in the parking lot, our families whining like tame geese   
at feeding time, and all the bosses of the earth   
cursing the traffic in the morning haze. 

They will telephone each other from their sofas   
and glass desks, with no idea where we could be,   
unable to picture the dark throat 
of the saxophone playing upriver, or the fire 
we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light,   
having stolen a truckload of roses 
and thrown them into the sea.

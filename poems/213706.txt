Holding only a handful of rushlight 
they pressed deeper into the dark, at a crouch   
until the great rock chamber 
flowered around them and they stood 
in an enormous womb of 
flickering light and darklight, a place 
to make a start. Raised hands cast flapping shadows   
over the sleeker shapes of radiance. 

They've left the world of weather and panic 
behind them and gone on in, drawing the dark   
in their wake, pushing as one pulse 
to the core of stone. The pigments mixed in big shells   
are crushed ore, petals and pollens, berries 
and the binding juices oozed 
out of chosen barks. The beasts 

begin to take shape from hands and feather-tufts   
(soaked in ochre, manganese, madder, mallow white)   
stroking the live rock, letting slopes and contours   
mould those forms from chance, coaxing 
rigid dips and folds and bulges 
to lend themselves to necks, bellies, swelling haunches,   
a forehead or a twist of horn, tails and manes 
curling to a crazy gallop. 

Intent and human, they attach 
the mineral, vegetable, animal 
realms to themselves, inscribing 
the one unbroken line 
everything depends on, from that 
impenetrable centre 
to the outer intangibles of light and air, even   
the speed of the horse, the bison's fear, the arc 
of gentleness that this big-bellied cow   
arches over its spindling calf, or the lancing   
dance of death that 
bristles out of the buck's 
struck flank. On this one line they leave   
a beak-headed human figure of sticks   
and one small, chalky, human hand. 

We'll never know if they worked in silence   
like people praying—the way our monks   
illuminated their own dark ages   
in cross-hatched rocky cloisters,   
where they contrived a binding   
labyrinth of lit affinities 
to spell out in nature's lace and fable   
their mindful, blinding sixth sense 
of a god of shadows—or whether (like birds   
tracing their great bloodlines over the globe)   
they kept a constant gossip up 
of praise, encouragement, complaint. 

It doesn't matter: we know 
they went with guttering rushlight 
into the dark; came to terms 
with the given world; must have had 
—as their hands moved steadily 
by spiderlight—one desire 
we'd recognise: they would—before going on   
beyond this border zone, this nowhere   
that is now here—leave something 
upright and bright behind them in the dark.

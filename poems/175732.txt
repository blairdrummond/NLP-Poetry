text : 
A stabbing in miniature, it is, 
a tiny crime, 
my own blood parceled 
drop by drop and set 
on the flickering tongue 
of this machine. 
It is the spout-punching of trees 
for syrup new and smooth 
and sweeter 
than nature ever intended. 
It is Sleeping Beauty's curse 
and fascination. 
It is the dipstick measuring of oil 
from the Buick's throat, 
the necessary maintenance. 
It is every vampire movie ever made. 
Hand, my martyr without lips, 
my quiet cow. 
I'll milk your fingertips 
for all they're worth. 
For what they're worth. 
Something like a harvest, it is, 
a tiny crime.

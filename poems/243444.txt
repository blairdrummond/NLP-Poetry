title : Not Over It

author : Heather McHugh

In sympathy with Gaspara Stampa
By woman so touched, so pressed,
 detachment being thought
 achievable at all
  
 is boggling in itself. Its being
 thought achievable by love—but love
 for only all (not someone’s single) sentience—
  
 appears the precept of too cold
 a form of flame. How much
 of a hand in things
  
 relinquishes the hold
 of things-at-hand?
 What kiss might such
  
 a mind reclaim? A swirl of dust
 in Buddhist schools, perhaps.
 A view of several solar
  
 systems from above.
 Not love.
 The thought
  
 appeals as it appals:
 Slow learners, we must spurn
 the selving sensualities, to feel
  
 for feelers of this kind,
 unfasten passion’s burner
 to identify what’s under it—
  
 in short, must court
 dispassion just
 to be compassionate.

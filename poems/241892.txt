title : Fly, Dragonfly!

author : Joyce Sidman

text : 
Water nymph, you have
 climbed from the shallows to don
 your dragon-colors.
 Perched on a reed stem
 all night, shedding your skin, you dry
 your wings in moonlight.
  
 Night melts into day.
 Swift birds wait to snap you up.
 Fly, dragonfly! Fly!

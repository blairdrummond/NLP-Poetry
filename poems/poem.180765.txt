O absent presence, Stella is not here; 
    False flattering hope, that with so fair a face 
    Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place 
Stella, I say my Stella, should appear. 
What say'st thou now? Where is that dainty cheer 
    Thou told'st mine eyes should help their famished case? 
    But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace 
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near. 
    But here I do store of fair ladies meet, 
    Who may with charm of conversation sweet 
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow: 
    Sure they prevail as much with me, as he 
    That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be 
Merry with him, and not think of his woe.

title : “My Mother is a Fish”

My mother is a fish 
and the sky is low and orange, 
and the long grass rises   
in the still air. 
The mud is black   
and worms turn   
their cold segments   
at my feet. 

      I used to walk   
      with an old lady. 
      It seemed far from water 
      and the ground sank. 
      Weeds were higher 
      than my head.   
      Slugs slept 
      in the mud. 

My mother is a fish 
and the sky swallows my head.   
A fine rain comes 
and softens the ferns. 

In March before the crocus   
and the lily, 
eggs bunch in the shoal   
of green jelly. 
Crabs glide through them.   
A kingfisher is dead 
on a rock. 

My mother is an eel   
winding a light 
around the rock.   
Even without a moon   
the black glows. 


* 

The sun grows like an egg 
over the bridge, 
the first birds are silver 
and swoop down for my mother. 

      When the lady came 
      we jumped— 
      She took us to find worms   
      we could squeeze 
      in our hands. 

      I went with my father 
      to the dark water. 
      I went with a bucket 
      of mud. 
      When we doubled the worm   
      on the hook and it coiled,   
      I could hear how a bass 
      could thud. 

      I grabbed it 
      with a wet hand,   
      and watched its eye   
      go black 
      as I dropped it 
      in a metal bucket. 

      Hack it along the gill 
      and throw the head to the gulls. 

My mother is a fish 
and flutters in my bucket.   
The sky is a fleck of stones   
on the night water. 
Turns my arms silver. 

The wind calls my father   
out to where bigger birds   
call and caw and spin, 

where my father goes 
and leaves me with the mud   
and gulls on the patchy water.

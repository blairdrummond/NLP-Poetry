title : Poem for My Twentieth Birthday

author : Kenneth Koch

text : 
Passing the American graveyard, for my birthday
the crosses stuttering, white on tropical green,
the yearsâ€™ quick focus of faces I do not remember . . .

The palm trees stalking like deliberate giants
for my birthday, and all the hot adolescent memories
seen through a screen of water . . .

For my birthday thrust into the adult and actual:
expected to perform the action, not to ponder
the reality beyond the fact,
the man standing upright in the dream.

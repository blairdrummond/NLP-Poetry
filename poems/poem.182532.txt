Sonnet

Alone, unfriended, on a foreign shore,
   Behold an hapless, melancholy maid,
Begging her scanty fare from door to door,
   With piteous voice, and humbly bended head.
Alas! her native tongue is known to few:
   Her manners and her garb excite suprise;
The vulgar stare to see her bid adieu;
   Her tattered garments fix their curious eyes.
Cease, cease your laugh, ye thoughtless vain;
Why sneer at yon poor Indian's pain?
'Tis nature's artless voice that speaks:
Behold the tear bedew her cheeks!
Imploring actions, bursting sighs,
Reveal enough to British eyes.

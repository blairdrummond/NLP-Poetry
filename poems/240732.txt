title : Have A Good One [In the error]

author : Anselm Berrigan

text : 
In the error
                              thinking of non-intervention
                                  with you. A red sun
                                      (don’t look) pokes
                                 through. Staging
                              development and the cutting
                         loose of its facile integrity
                              its disproportionate 
                                       personal non-response.
                                   The wince. The shrug. The
                                       belated semi-acknowledgment
                                            of owning just
                                                 enough to take part.
                                   In the era, thinking of you
                                       will quit my job
                                                in one year to get
                                          more done, work harder
                                                 to insert myself into 
                                             the fragile extension
                                       of space between us
                                              to get something done.
                                                  In the ear
                                                      thinking after you.

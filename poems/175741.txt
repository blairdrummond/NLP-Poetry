text : 
The boys who fled my father's house in fear 
Of what his wrath would cost them if he found 
Them nibbling slowly at his daughter's ear, 
Would vanish out the back without a sound, 
And glide just like the shadow of a crow, 
To wait beside the elm tree in the snow. 
Something quite deadly rumbled in his voice. 
He sniffed the air as if he knew the scent 
Of teenage boys, and asked, "What was that noise?" 
Then I'd pretend to not know what he meant, 
Stand mutely by, my heart immense with dread, 
As Father set the traps and went to bed.

The grammatical rules of this language can be learned in one 
sitting. 

Nouns have no gender & end in -o; the plural terminates in -oj 
(pronounced -oy) & the accusative, -on (plural 0ojn). 

Amiko, friend; amikoj, friends; amikon & amikojn, accusative 
friend & friends. 

Adjectives end in –a & take plural & accusative endings to 
agree with things. 

Ma amiko is my friend. 

All verbs are regular & have only one form for each tense or 
mood; they are not altered for person or number. Mi havas 
bonajn amikojn is simply to say I have good friends. 

Adverbs end in –e. 

La bonaj amiko estas ie. The good friend is here.

A new book appears in Esperanto every week. Radio stations in 
Europe, the United States, China, Russia & Brazil broadcast in 
Esperanto, as does Vatican Radio. In 1959, UNESCO declared the 
International Federation of Esperanto Speakers to be in accord with 
its mission & granted this body consultative status. The youth 
branch of the International Federation of Esperanto Speakers, UTA, 
has offices in 80 different countries & organizes social events where 
young people curious about the movement may dance to recordings 
by Esperanto artists, enjoy complimentary soft drinks & take home 
Esperanto versions of major literary works including the Old 
Testament & A Midsummer Night’s Dream. William Shatner’s first 
feature-length vehicle was a horror film shot entirely in Esperanto. 
Esperanto is among the languages currently sailing into deep space 
on board the Voyager spacecraft.

Esperanto is an artificial language 
constructed in 1887 by L. 
    L. Zamenhof, a polish 
         oculist. I first came 
across Fundamento Esperanto, the text 
    which introduced this system 
            to the world, as I travelled abroad 

following a somewhat difficult period 
in my life. It was twilight & snowing on the 
    railway platform just outside 
         Warsaw where I had missed 
my connection. A man in a crumpled track suit 
    & dark glasses pushed a cart 
            piled high with ripped & weathered volumes— 

sex manuals, detective stories, yellowing 
musical scores & outdated physics textbooks, 
    old copies of Life, new smut, 
         an atlas translated, 
a grammar, The Mirror, Soviet-bloc comics, 
    a guide to the rivers & 
            mountains, thesauri, inscrutable 

musical scores & mimeographed physics books, 
defective stories, obsolete sex manuals— 
         one of which caught my notice 
         (Dr. Esperanto, 
Zamenhof’s pen name, translates as He Who Hopes) & 
    since I had time, I traded 
         my used Leaves of Grass for a copy.

Mi amas vin, bela amiko. 
I’m afraid I will never be lonely enough. 
There’s a man from Quebec in my head, 

a friend to the purple martins. 
Purple martins are the Cadillac of swallows. 
All purple martins are dying or dead. 
Brainscans of grown purple martins suggest 
these creatures feel the same levels of doubt 

& bliss as an eight-year-old girl in captivity. 
While driving home from the brewery 
one night this man from Quebec heard a radio program 
about purple martins & the next day he set out 
to build them a house 
in his own back yard. I’ve never built anything, 
let alone a house, 

not to mention a home 
for somebody else. 

I’ve never unrolled a blueprint onto a workbench, 
sunk a post, 
or sent the neighbor’s kid pedalling off 
to the store for a bag full of nails. 

I’ve never waited ten years for a swallow. 

Never put in aluminum floors to smooth over the waiting. 
Never piped sugar water through colored tubes 
to each empty nest lined with newspaper shredded 
with strong, tired hands. 
Never dismantled the entire affair 

& put it back together again. 
Still no swallows. 
I never installed the big light that stays on through the night 

to keep owls away. Never installed lesser lights, 
never rested on Sunday 

with a beer on the deck surveying 
what I had done 
& what yet remained to be done, listening to Styx 

while the neighbor kids ran through my sprinklers. 
I have never collapsed in abandon. 
Never prayed. 
But enough about purple martins.

As we speak, Esperanto is being corrupted 
by upset languages such as Interlingua, 
Klingon, Java & various cryptophasic tongues. 

Our only hope of reversing this trend is to write 
the Esperanto epic. Through its grandeur 
& homegrown humility, it will spur men 

to freeze the mutating patios so the children 
of our children’s children may dwell in this song 
& find comfort in its true texture & frame. 

It’s worth a try. As I imagine it, it ends 
in the middle of things. Every line of the work 
is a first & a last line & this is the spring 

of its action. Of course, there’s a journey 
& inside that journey, an implicit voyage 
through the underworld. There’s a bridge 

made of boats; a carp stuffed with flowers; 
a comic dispute among sweetmeat vendors; 
a digression on shadows; men clapping 

in fields to scare away crows; an unending list 
of warships: The Unternehmen, The Impresa, 
The Muyarchi, Viec Lam, The Przedsiebiorstwo, 

The Indarka, The Enterprise, L’Entreprise, 
Entrepeno... One could go on. But by now, 
all the characters have turned into swallows 

& bank as one flock in the sky—that is, 
all except one. That’s how we finally learn 
who the hero was all along. Weary & old, 

he sits on a rock & watches his friends 
fly by one by one out of the song, 
then turns back to the journey they all began 

long ago, keeping the river to his right.

It's how she spreads, without a sound, her scent 
of orange blossom on the dark of me, 
it is the way she shrouds in mourning black   
her mother-of-pearl and ivory, the way 
she wears the lace ruff at her throat, and how 
she turns her face, quite voiceless, self-possessed,   
because she takes the language straight to heart,   
is thrifty with the words she speaks. 
                                                                                                 It's how   
she is so reticent yet welcoming 
when she comes out to face my panegyrics, 
the way she says my name 
mocking and mimicking, makes gentle fun, 
yet she's aware that my unspoken drama 
is really of the heart, though a little silly; 
it's how, when night is deep and at its darkest, 
we linger after dinner, vaguely talking 
and her laughing smile grows fainter and then falls 
gently on the tablecloth; it's the teasing way 
she won't give me her arm and then allows 
deep feeling to come with us when we walk out, 
promenading on the hot colonial boulevard. . . 

Because of this, your sighing, modest style 
of love, I worship you, my faithful star 
who like to cloud yourself about in mourning, 
generous, hidden blossom; kindly 
mellowness who have presided over   
my thirty years with the self-denying singleness   
a vase has, whose half-blown roses wreathe with scent 
the headboard of a convalescent man; 
cautious nurse, shy 
serving maid, dear friend who trembles 
with the trembling of a child when you revise 
the reading that we share; apprehensive, always timid 
guest at the feast I give; my ally, 
humble dove that coos when it is morning 
in a minor key, a key that's wholly yours. 

May you be blessed, modest, magnificent; 
you have possessed the highest summit of my heart, 
you who are at once the artist   
of lowly and most lofty things, who bear in your hands 
my life as if it was your work of art! 

O star and orange blossom, may you dwindle 
gently rocked in an unwedded peace, 
and may you fade out like a morning star 
which the lightening greenness of a meadow darkens 
or like a flower that finds transfiguration 
on the blue west, as it might on a simple bed.

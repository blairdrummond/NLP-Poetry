title : Rogue Russets

author : R. T. Smith

text : 
Surprised by a frill of white flower 
where I'd never planted an eye, 
I decided to fence it with sticks 

and let the renegade live 
in undoctored soil where the garden 
gave way to volunteer poplars 

and acidic white pine. Why not? 
After all, away from the tribe, 
in clay where beetles drill 

and weeds emerge inspired, 
it might grow eccentric, proliferate 
and thrive. 
                When autumn air 

said disinter, to fill the bin 
for winter, I troweled under 
and pulled the stem 

until a rabble of rough spuds 
red as Etruscan urns emerged 
as if to prove 

that whatever urge drove 
the rogue to sow itself and strive 
beyond all cultivation 

might offer a vital lesson 
to any apostate instinct 
aspiring to survive.

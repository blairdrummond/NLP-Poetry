My little lack-of-light, my swaddled soul,    
December baby. Hush, for it is dark,    
and will grow darker still. We must embark    
directly. Bring an orange as the toll    
for Charon: he will be our gondolier.    
Upon the shore, the season pans for light,    
and solstice fish, their eyes gone milky white,    
come bearing riches for the dying year:    
solstitial kingdom. It is yours, the mime    
of branches and the drift of snow. With shaking    
hands, Persephone, the winter’s wife,    
will tender you a gift. Born in a time    
of darkness, you will learn the trick of making.    
You shall make your consolation all your life.

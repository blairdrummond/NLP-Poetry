title : Slow Dancing on the Highway:the Trip North

author : Elizabeth Hobbs

text : 
You follow close behind me, 
for a thousand miles responsive to my movements. 
I signal, you signal back. We will meet at the next exit. 

You blow kisses, which I return. 
You mouth "I love you," a message for my rearview mirror. 

We do a slow tango as we change lanes in tandem, 
gracefully, as though music were guiding us. 
It is tighter than bodies locked in heat, 
this caring, this ardent watching.

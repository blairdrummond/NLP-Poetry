title : from Odes: 10. Chorus of Furies

text : 
Guarda mi disse, le feroce Erine
Let us come upon him first as if in a dream, 
anonymous triple presence, 
memory made substance and tally of heart’s rot:   
then in the waking Now be demonstrable, seem   
sole aspect of being’s essence, 
coffin to the living touch, self’s Iscariot. 
Then he will loath the year’s recurrent long caress   
without hope of divorce, 
envying idiocy’s apathy or the stress 
of definite remorse. 
He will lapse into a halflife lest the taut force 
of the mind’s eagerness 
recall those fiends or new apparitions endorse 
his excessive distress. 
He will shrink, his manhood leave him, slough selfaware   
the last skin of the flayed: despair. 
He will nurse his terror carefully, uncertain 
even of death’s solace, 
impotent to outpace 
dispersion of the soul, disruption of the brain.

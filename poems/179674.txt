title : What Way

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
At the table, at the grave not knowing 
whether to grieve or celebrate, they seemed 
to find a way within the stalled noon clatter 
and the dusk over oily swamps and elder tangle 
along a locked stockade of heavy machines, 
as the blue heron, looking down, flew farther on. 
Nothing dissolved for them the mortal green 
and black in transparent power of spacious streams 
now gone from earth. The flickering they found, 
terror-hope-terror, in fire of sunset clouds 
remained unwavering in its progress to night 
and day and night. And yet the pleasure they took 
in everything did not wear out. The limestone 
quarry of a poorer century, lipped in birds 
and berries, treasured up, still treasures up, 
old rains beneath its surface of dusty jetâ€” 
still waits behind their houses on airless nights 
to be the dreams and drownings of new children.

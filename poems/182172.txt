title : My Mother Contemplating Her Gun

One boyfriend said to keep the bullets 

locked in a different room. 
                                    Another urged 
            clean it 
or it could explode. Larry 

thought I should keep it loaded 
under my bed, 
                     you never know. 

            I bought it 
when I didn’t feel safe. The barrel 
                         is oily, 

             reflective, the steel 

pure, pulled from a hole 
                      in West Virginia. It 

could have been cast into anything, nails 
along the carpenter’s lip, the ladder 

to balance the train. Look at this, one 
                        bullet, 

                        how almost nothing it is— 

             saltpeter   sulphur   lead   Hell 

burns sulphur, a smell like this. 
                        safety & hammer, barrel & grip 

             I don’t know what I believe. 

I remember the woods behind my father’s house 
          horses beside the quarry 

stolen cars lost in the deepest wells, 
the water below 
            an ink waiting to fill me. 

                      Outside a towel hangs from a cold line 
            a sheet of iron in the sky 

            roses painted on it, blue roses. 

Tomorrow it will still be there.

(After Dr. Haase gave them shots of morphine, Magda gave each child an ampule of potassium cyanide from a spoon.)
This is the needle that we give 
Soldiers and children when they live   
Near the front in primitive 
    Conditions or real dangers; 
This is the spoon we use to feed   
Men trapped in trouble or in need,   
When weakness or bad luck might lead 
    Them to the hands of strangers. 

This is the room where you can sleep   
Your sleep out, curled up under deep   
Layers of covering that will keep 
    You safe till all harm’s past. 
This is the bed where you can rest   
In perfect silence, undistressed 
By noise or nightmares, as my breast   
    Once held you soft but fast. 

This is the Doctor who has brought   
Your needle with your special shot   
To quiet you; you won’t get caught 
    Off guard or unprepared. 
I am your nurse who’ll comfort you;   
I nursed you, fed you till you grew   
Too big to feed; now you’re all through 
    Fretting or feeling scared. 

This is the glass tube that contains 
Calm that will spread down through your veins   
To free you finally from all pains 
    Of going on in error. 
This tiny pinprick sets the germ 
Inside you that fills out its term 
Till you can feel yourself grow firm 
    Against all doubt, all terror. 

Into this spoon I break the pill   
That stiffens the unsteady will   
And hardens you against the chill 
    Voice of a world of lies. 
This amber medicine implants   
Steadfastness in your blood; this grants   
Immunity from greed and chance, 
    And from all compromise. 

This is the serum that can cure 
Weak hearts; these pure, clear drops insure   
You’ll face what comes and can endure   
    The test; you’ll never falter. 
This is the potion that preserves 
You in a faith that never swerves; 
This sets the pattern of your nerves 
    Too firm for you to alter. 

I set this spoon between your tight   
Teeth, as I gave you your first bite;   
This satisfies your appetite 
    For other nourishment. 
Take this on your tongue; this do   
Remembering your mother who 
So loved her Leader she stayed true 
    When all the others went, 

When every friend proved false, in the   
Delirium of treachery 
On every hand, when even He 
    Had turned His face aside. 
He shut himself in with His whore; 
Then, though I screamed outside His door,   
Said He’d not see me anymore. 
    They both took cyanide. 

Open wide, now, little bird; 
I who sang you your first word 
Soothe away every sound you’ve heard   
    Except your Leader’s voice. 
Close your eyes, now; take your death.   
Once we slapped you to take breath.   
Vengeance is mine, the Lord God saith 
    And cancels each last choice. 

Once, my first words marked out your mind;   
Just as our Leader’s phrases bind 
All hearts to Him, building a blind 
    Loyalty through the nation, 
We shape you into a pure form. 
Trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,   
The Reds: those last hours, they felt warm   
    Who stood fast to their station. 

You needn’t fear what your life meant; 
You won’t curse how your hours were spent;   
You’ll grow like your own monument 
    To all things sure and good, 
Fixed like a frieze in high relief 
Of granite figures that our Chief 
Accepts into His true belief, 
    His true blood-brotherhood. 

You’ll never bite the hand that fed you,   
Won’t turn away from those that bred you,   
Comforted your nights and led you 
    Into the thought of virtue; 
You won’t be turned from your own bed;   
Won’t turn into that thing you dread;   
No new betrayal lies ahead; 
    Now no one else can hurt you.

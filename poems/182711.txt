title : The House of Rest

author : Julia Ward Howe

text : 
I will build a house of rest, 
Square the corners every one: 
At each angle on his breast 
Shall a cherub take the sun; 
Rising, risen, sinking, down, 
Weaving day’s unequal crown. 

In the chambers, light as air, 
Shall responsive footsteps fall: 
Brother, sister, art thou there? 
Hush! we need not jar nor call; 
Need not turn to seek the face 
Shut in rapture’s hiding-place. 

Heavy load and mocking care 
Shall from back and bosom part; 
Thought shall reach the thrill of prayer, 
Patience plan the dome of art. 
None shall praise or merit claim, 
Not a joy be called by name. 

With a free, unmeasured tread 
Shall we pace the cloisters through: 
Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead; 
Rest till Love be born anew. 
Weary Thought shall take his time, 
Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme. 

No reproof shall grieve or chill; 
Every sin doth stand confest; 
None need murmur, ‘This was ill’: 
Therefore do they grant us rest; 
Contemplation making whole 
Every ruin of the soul. 

Pictures shall as softly look 
As in distance shows delight; 
Slowly shall each saintly book 
Turn its pages in our sight; 
Not the study’s wealth confuse, 
Urging zeal to pale abuse. 

Children through the windows peep, 
Not reproachful, though our own; 
Hushed the parent passion deep, 
And the household’s eager tone. 
One above, divine and true, 
Makes us children like to you. 

Measured bread shall build us up 
At the hospitable board; 
In Contentment’s golden cup 
Is the guileless liquor poured. 
May the beggar pledge the king 
In that spirit gathering, 

Oh! my house is far away; 
Yet it sometimes shuts me in. 
Imperfection mars each day 
While the perfect works begin. 
In the house of labor best 
Can I build the house of rest.

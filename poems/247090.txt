title : Postcard from a Place I Have Never Been

author : Steve Kistulentz

One condition of work-release is daily to confess 
my obsessions, which I then write in disco glitter, 
one gluey blossom across my permanent record. 
When I eat too much of the local fruit, it gives me 
clairvoyance. But I forget to write down the predictions, 
instead crush cherry pits into a fine powder, chop 
the powder into lines with an expired credit card. 
The homeless give me quarters. Union rules require 
at least one mention of the weather here. My flight 
leaves on an inexact date in the nebulous future, 
arrives late afternoon, two days before our first kiss. 
I pay the airline $25 extra to lose my dignity between 
here and Chicago. At the airport you buy it back.
When I walk to the market to buy more cherries, 
a parade of kittens follows, marching in formation, 
singing precise and bawdy cadence about prostitutes 
and crack houses. They change the names to protect 
the innocent. Signs say this mile of interstate is paved 
with the bones of the great mastodons, and kept clean 
by the well-meaning gentlemen of the Kiwanis Club. 
Vacationers from further south sit in the lobby 
watching guests from the north put on 
one-act plays. On even-numbered days, only, of course. 
Registered letters from the clerk of the court inform me 
that it won't violate my probation to drag you across 
state lines as long as I promise to return you by 8 p.m., 
mostly whole. The desk clerk is also the milkman 
is the town orthodontist. Instead of leaving Bibles 
at bedside, Gideons leave individual soaps printed
with couplets from the Song of Songs, or corkscrews.
I did not catch last night's plays, but promised to attend
this evening's performance. I play a slightly amplified
version of myself, with one line: Wish you were here.
It's a song and dance number. Everyone applauds.

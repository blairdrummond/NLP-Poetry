title : The Shoes

author : Brent Pallas

text : 
When they first came 
their mouths agape 
their bodies shining 
like beetles about to stir 

every edge poised 
for the multitude of steps 
some moment 
of leaping not yet taken 

their hides stiff 
shielding some tenderness 
within, warming 
to the creak of movement 

over penitent steps 
or dusty wastes, unyielding 
tasks or stony memorials 
of waiting 

through the heat of day's 
quiet middle, every icy 
threshold or soggy spring 
their heels flush with pavement, 

their soles flung aside only 
for love, all the tattered 
maps of their seams, every 
unforgiving rub.

title : Early Morning, Left-Handed

author : Hilda Raz

text : 
Lear's five nevers over 
the fool hanged, and Cordelia 
and Lear dead at last, Edmund 
reported and yes he was loved 
by both evil sisters, so what. 
I'm awake in the dawn. Cold 
stone floors. The cat. His 
father loved him too, I tell 
my son on the phone, my 
son just married. Let him 
cleave to his wife. Let my 
old flesh resume its boundaries, 
let go. No divisions of the kingdom. 
Will they write of my courage 
killing the snake? We know 
the dreamy answer to that one. 
Honey tea swirls us sweet; 
never fear the village fair, 
lights stay on all night. 
Tea bags bottomless coffee 
cup. Ashes in the grate sweeten 
the garden provender. Clay. 
Ripeness is all. The fool lives on, 
my left elbow's cartilage feather.

title : Checklist

author : Stephen Dunn

text : 
The housework, the factory work, the work
that takes from the body
and does not put back.
The white-collar work and the dirt 
of its profits, the terrible politeness
of the office worker, the work that robs 
the viscera to pay the cool
surfaces of the brain. All the work 
that makes love difficult, brings on 
sleep, drops the body off
at the liquor cabinet. All the work 
that reaches the intestines and sprawls. 
And the compulsive work after the work 
is done, those unfillable spaces
of the Calvinist, or certain marriage beds.

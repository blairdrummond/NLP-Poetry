title : Toasting Marshmallows

author : Kristine O'Connell George

I am a careful marshmallow toaster,
 a patient marshmallow roaster,
 turning my stick oh-so-slowly,
 taking my time, checking often.
 This is art---
 a time of serious reflection
 as my pillowed confection
 slowly reaches golden perfection.
  
 My brother
             grabs ‘em with grubby hands
                         shoves ‘em on the stick
                                     burns ‘em to a crisp
                                                 cools ‘em off
                                                             flicks soot
                                                                         eats quick.
  
 I’m still turning my stick.
 He’s already eaten six.

text : 
This was the winter mother told time by my heart 
ticking like a frayed fan belt in my chest. 
This was the fifties & we were living on nothing 
& what of her, the black girl, my own black nurse, 
what of her who arrived on Greyhound in the heart 
of so dramatic a storm it froze the sleeves at her wrists 
& each nostril was rimed with white like salt on a glass, 
what of her who came up the dark stair on the limp of her   
own bad ticker, weary, arrogant, thin, her suitcase noosed 
with rope, in the grip of a rage she came, a black woman, 
into our white lives, like a splinter, & stayed. Charming 
& brilliantly condescending, she leaned down to kiss “the baby,”   
& hissed my little princess & hushed the Jordan & set the chariots 
on the golden streets & Mother, I cried to her, & went out like a light.

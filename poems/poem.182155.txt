How many times these low feet staggered (238) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Living, Death



How many times these low feet staggered -
Only the soldered mouth can tell -
Try - can you stir the awful rivet - 
Try - can you lift the hasps of steel! 

Stroke the cool forehead - hot so often - 
Lift - if you care - the listless hair - 
Handle the adamantine fingers 
Never a thimble - more - shall wear - 

Buzz the dull flies - on the chamber window - 
Brave - shines the sun through the freckled pane - 
Fearless - the cobweb swings from the ceiling - 
Indolent Housewife - in Daisies - lain!

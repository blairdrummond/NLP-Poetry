title : Ex Machina

text : 
When love was a question, the message arrived 
in the beak of a wire and plaster bird. The coloratura   
was hardly to be believed. For flight, 

it took three stagehands: two 
on the pulleys and one on the flute. And you   
thought fancy rained like grace. 

Our fog machine lost in the Parcel Post, we improvised   
with smoke. The heroine dies of tuberculosis after all.   
Remorse and the raw night air: any plausible tenor 

might cough. The passions, I take my clues 
from an obvious source, may be less like climatic events   
than we conventionalize, though I’ve heard 

of tornadoes that break the second-best glassware   
and leave everything else untouched.   
There’s a finer conviction than seamlessness 

elicits: the Greeks knew a god 
by the clanking behind his descent. 
The heart, poor pump, protests till you’d think 

it’s rusted past redemption, but 
there’s tuning in these counterweights,   
celebration’s assembled voice.

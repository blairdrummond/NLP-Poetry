title : A Few Miles Off

Too many are leaving
     usually they greet in sleep before dashing
as in today with this gentleman
     (awkward not to type his name)
when yesterday in the shower
     I remembered his face in Aardvark
something about NWA but not about them
     just a played reference
There were newspaper clips
     all police brutality, all framed with snow
& I vaguely recalled something 
     about Uma Thurman & the Menils 
when the guard ushered me out 
     for touching the African sculptures
I waited in the lobby for hours
     like this morning reading 
that he overdosed. It was a hotel 
     & I didn’t even know him
I don’t even know his work

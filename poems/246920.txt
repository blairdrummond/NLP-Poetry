title : To You Again

author : Mary Szybist

text : 
Again this morning my eyes woke up too close 
to your eyes,

their almost green orbs
too heavy-lidded to really look back.

To wake up next to you
is ordinary. I do not even need to look at you

to see you.
But I do look. So when you come to me

in your opulent sadness, I see 
you do not want me

to unbutton you
so I cannot do the one thing

I can do.
Now it is almost one a.m. I am still at my desk

and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase 
away from me. Already it is years

of you a staircase
away from me. To be near you

and not near you 
is ordinary.

You
are ordinary.

Still, how many afternoons have I spent 
peeling blue paint from

our porch steps, peering above 
hedgerows, the few parked cars for the first

glimpse of you. How many hours under 
the overgrown, pink Camillas, thinking

the color was wrong for you, thinking 
you'd appear

after my next 
blink.

Soon you'll come down the stairs 
to tell me something. And I'll say,

okay. Okay. I'll say it 
like that, say it just like

that, I'll go on being 
your never-enough.

It's not the best in you
I long for. It's when you're noteless,

numb at the ends of my fingers, all is 
all. I say it is.

title : The Batture

text : 
The batture’s water and sand disappear 
when water swells the river, 
heat’s portion of a northern winter. 
Under willows cropped up 
since our last cow is dead 
and carried to the batture 
to be taken by the water 
clean into another season, 
we sit on green granite 
piled deep enough to keep 
the batture dry one more week. 

We don’t say so but we wait 
for the swollen body 
to appear before us, we want 
the torn leg to distract us, 
the loose arm to show us where. 
We’ve always known which way 
the water runs, the differences 
among earth, air, water 
and whatever the horizon offers 
that is not actually there. 
We want to be the ones 
to identify the missing person. 
We count the reward we’d earn. 

There is a family 
in southern Minnesota 
keeping a closet of dry-cleaned 
suits, a mahogany high-boy 
of ironed shirts, folded 
undershorts and sweaters. 
In the ashtray that says Welcome to Nevada 
are the coins he left 
without thinking, 
the only clue which tells his family 
what they didn’t want to know, 
he might have known 
what he was doing. 

We want to be the ones whose call 
is first in a series of related events 
which will end we hope in the family’s 
satisfaction with the coroner’s 
identification, and though it is old-fashioned 
and no longer done in this country, 
we’d like to think the pennies 
from his pocket will be mailed 
to the morgue, polished to 
their copper finish, pressed 
to float forever on his eyelids and make us 
take a second look as the light 
hits them and they beautifully glitter. 

We think how glad we were 
when we first saw him he floated 
face down in the water 
which a few moments earlier had been snow 
his children sledded and slipped on. 
Light beats gravity, lifts 
these young trees from the water. 
This is where we watch time, 
mark the spot across the water 
which is the red flag 
we hope calls us 
come across and save us. 
This is twenty-eight states.

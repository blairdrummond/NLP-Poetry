title : The New Chinese Fiction

author : James Tate

text : 
Although the depiction of living forms 
was not explicitly forbidden, the only good news 
about famines was that the station was empty. 
It was about 2 A.M. The truck drove away. 
A tropical insect that lives in enormous cities 
stroked my hair awkwardly, organizing everyone's 
schedule. She drove me back to my hotel 
in a misty and allusive style, while the old 
schools continued the process of devolution. 
Part of the roof was loose and flapped noisily 
in the wind, who needed work like that? 
Poor brethren, do you have any good prose yet? 
The New Chinese fiction is getting better, 
I suspect, people walking and thinking and fussing, 
with a nest to fly out of, with a less intimate footing. 
Are we responsible for their playtimes? 
Keep up your music, my dears; there were a lot of people 
like that, with strange eyes, green fields and orchards. 
The little house they sat in produced simple people, 
cars full of blood, all they needed was a hat, 
extramusical sounds, purging the emotions. 
Expect no mercy, I said, from the sickbay. 
And try to imagine Howard Hughes piloting the plane 
that flew Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton off 
toward their marriage in 1950. Well, don't bother. 
The New Chinese fiction shouldn't concern itself 
with anything other than a stolen turnip 
and a coldness in the heart, and a lit window, 
a young man on a horse appearing and then disappearing.

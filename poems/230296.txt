title : Blue-Crested Cry

author : Jennifer Reeser

text : 
We’re through, we’re through, we’re through, we’re through, we’re through 

and—flanking, now, the edges of our schism— 
it seems your coldness and my idealism 
alone for all this time have kept us true. 

Credulous I and hedonistic you: 
opposed, refracting angles of a prism 
who challenged sense with childish skepticism— 
and every known the bulk of mankind knew.

title : Tender Only to One

author : Stevie Smith

text : 
Tender only to one   
Tender and true   
The petals swing   
To my fingering 
Is it you, or you, or you? 

Tender only to one 
I do not know his name 
And the friends who fall   
To the petals’ call 
May think my love to blame. 

Tender only to one   
This petal holds a clue   
The face it shows 
But too well knows   
Who I am tender to. 

Tender only to one, 
Last petal’s latest breath 
Cries out aloud 
From the icy shroud 
His name, his name is Death.

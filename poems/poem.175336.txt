Rhymed Stanza

Whatever is we only know
As in our minds we find it so;
      No staring fact is half so clear
      As one dim, preconceived idea --
No matter how the fact may glow.

Vainly may Truth her trumpet blow
To stir our minds; like heavy dough
      They stick to what they think ? won't hear
         Whatever is.

Our ancient myths in solid row
Stand up ? we simply have to go
      And choke each fiction old and dear
      Before the modest facts appear;
Then we may grasp, reluctant, slow,
         Whatever is.

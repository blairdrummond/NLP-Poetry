title : Just Now

author : Peter Campion

text : 
a ladybug, its carapace blown open 
so a translucent trace of orange gleams 
from its body, has ascended link by link 
the smudgy silver curve of my watch band. 
It must have helicoptered past the sill 
while I was slumped here squinting in the paper 
at the ashen packaging another bombing's 
made of a minivan. Made available 
in the photo like the homeless in a poem. 
The pain is far away. But then for moments 
utterly clear: molten metal guttering 
down from the Milky Way to fall on us. 
And sometimes, God, it lands with all its will. 
My spluttered prayer for it to hold its distance: 
how ludicrous to blurt it from this comfort. 
Still it impels itself from me. Please stay 
away from me. Please stay away from this 
insectile soul who only weeks ago 
was wind and shit and jasmine leaves and rain.

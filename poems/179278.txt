title : Last Call

author : Randall Mann

text : 
A giant bird- 
of-paradise 
has climbed the bar: 
in this paradise 

there are no flowers, 
no flowers at all. 
When Happy Hour 
becomes Last Call— 

Adam in drag 
our royalty— 
we buy her gin 
for eternity 

(an unseen deejay 
scores the years 
with pulsing music 
of the spheres). 

Now the queen has gone, 
gone again 
in search of love, 
in search of sin. 

It’s closing time. 
You were not at fault. 
I drain my glass   
and lick the salt.

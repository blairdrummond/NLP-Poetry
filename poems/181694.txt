in memory of amy clampitt 
A single seedling, camp follower 
         of arson... 


Follower of ashes; follower 
of the bleached-out, burned-out 
cascade of buildings, lotfuls 

of whitened soil speckled with debris 
let down by a gutted church 
still aspiring to an ether-blue sky 

centuries gone; follower 
of scripts apotheosized into smoke, 
notes lifted into air by flames 

that all but threatened the entire lane 
with the silence we call a bed 
of dirt; follower of the match, 

the instigator here and abroad, 
the matutinal magnifying glass 
focusing light into unwitting 

summer grass, into cruciform twigs; 
follower of the caveat 
ignored because it was too small; 

follower of the fourth-oldest dream— 
the landscape burning and burning.

title : Dreams

author : Miroslav Holub

text : 
They sap manâ€™s substance 
as moon the dew. 
A rope grows erect 
from the crown of the head. 
A black swan hatches 
from a pebble. 
And a flock of angels in the sky 
is taking an evening class 
on the skid pan. 

I dream, so I dream. 
I dream 
that three times three is nine, 
that the right-hand 
rule applies; 
and when the circus leaves 
the trampled ground will 
once more overgrow with grass. 

Yes, grass. 
Unequivocal grass. 
Just grass.

Please god love me and buy me
  
 Read this hillock and ride me
 Wraith typing all day for money.
  
 God bought me today for two silver fish in a can
 God bought me tomorrow for bland in a pan
 and a card an email from Rebecca
  
 Bought four hours of my control alt delete shut down
 Bought a new day-section with a headstand
  
 My commerce in shall
  
 Sky like a grandstand
 Transact
  
 God performed me today for a half minute
 lucky
 in locker room hiding my boobs from the kids
 and my hair is silky and my mane shot silk gold
  
 Bought a book on economy
 Georgie Bataille
 Called about plane tickets
 Georgie Bataille
 I bought my debt today
 Georgie Bataille hooray
 Debt off my God today
  
 God off my debt in a macular hole
  
 I dream of an end like a fount to this night
 Run thinner and thinner and then it’﻿s all light
 Macerated in signal
  
 by my go
  
 I bought my ghost I walk my ghost

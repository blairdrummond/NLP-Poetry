title : Containment

author : A. E. Stallings

text : 
So long I have been carrying myself 
Carefully, carefully, like a small child 
With too much water in a real glass 
Clasped in two hands, across a space as vast 
As living rooms, while gazes watch the waves 
That start to rile the little inland sea 
And slap against its cliffs' transparency, 
Revise and meet, double their amplitude, 
Harmonizing doubt from many ifs. 
Distant frowns like clouds begin to brood. 
Soon there is overbrimming. Soon the child 
Looks up to find a face to match the scolding, 
And just as he does, the vessel he was holding 
Is almost set down safely on the bookshelf.

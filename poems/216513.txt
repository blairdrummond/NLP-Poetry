Today the cloud shapes are terrifying,   
and I keep expecting some enormous   
black-and-white B-movie Cyclops   
to appear at the edge of the horizon, 

to come striding over the ocean   
and drag me from my kitchen   
to the deep cave that flickered   
into my young brain one Saturday 

at the Baronet Theater where I sat helpless   
between my older brothers, pumped up   
on candy and horror—that cave, 
the litter of human bones 

gnawed on and flung toward the entrance,   
I can smell their stench as clearly 
as the bacon fat from breakfast. This   
is how it feels to lose it— 

not sanity, I mean, but whatever it is   
that helps you get up in the morning 
and actually leave the house 
on those days when it seems like death 

in his brown uniform 
is cruising his panel truck 
of packages through your neighborhood.   
I think of a friend’s voice 

on her answering machine— 
Hi, I’m not here— 
the morning of her funeral,   
the calls filling up the tape 

and the mail still arriving, 
and I feel as afraid as I was 
after all those vampire movies   
when I’d come home and lie awake 

all night, rigid in my bed, 
unable to get up 
even to pee because the undead   
were waiting underneath it; 

if I so much as stuck a bare 
foot out there in the unprotected air   
they’d grab me by the ankle and pull me   
under. And my parents said there was 

nothing there, when I was older   
I would know better, and now   
they’re dead, and I’m older,   
and I know better.

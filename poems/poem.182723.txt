I do not know if, climbing some steep hill,   
Through fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse I bought, 
Or whether in some mid-day I was caught 
To upper air, where visions of God's will 
In pictures to our quickened sense fulfil 
His word. But this I saw. 
                                    A path I sought 
Through wall of rock. No human fingers wrought 
The golden gates which opened sudden, still, 
And wide. My fear was hushed by my delight. 
Surpassing fair the lands; my path lay plain; 
Alas, so spell-bound, feasting on the sight, 
I paused, that I but reached the threshold bright, 
When, swinging swift, the golden gates again 
Were rocky wall, by which I wept in vain.

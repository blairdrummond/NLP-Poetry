There, in that lost 
       corner of the ordnance survey. 
Drive through the vanity — 
       two pubs and a garage — of Satley, 
then right, cross the A68 
       past down-at-heel farms and a quarry, 

you can't miss it, a 'T' instead of a 'plus' 
       where the road meets a wall. 
If it's a usual day 
       there'll be freezing wind, and you'll 
stumble climbing the stile 
       (a ladder, really) as you pull 

your hat down and zip up your jacket. 
       Out on the moor, 
thin air may be strong enough to   
       knock you over, 
but if you head into it 
       downhill, you can shelter 

in the wide, cindery trench of an old 
       leadmine-to-Consett railway. 
You may have to share it 
       with a crowd of dirty 
supercilious-looking ewes, who will baaa 
       and cut jerkily away 

after posting you blank stares 
       from their foreign eyes. 
One winter we came across five 
       steaming, icicle-hung cows. 
But in summer, when the heather's full of nests, 
       you'll hear curlews 

following you, raking your memory, maybe, 
       with their cries; 
or, right under you nose, 
       a grouse will whirr up surprised, 
like a poet startled by a line 
       when it comes to her sideways. 

No protection is offered by trees — 
       Hawthorn the English call May, 
a few struggling birches. 
       But of wagtails and yellowhammers, plenty, 
and peewits who never say peewit, 
       more a minor, go'way, go'way. 

Who was he, Salter? Why was this his gate? 
       A pedlars' way, they carried 
salt to meat. The place gives tang to 
       survival, its unstoppable view, 
a reservoir, ruins of the lead mines, new 
       forestry pushing from the right, the curlew.

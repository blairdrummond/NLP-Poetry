title : The Sea Chews Things Up

author : Cleopatra Mathis

text : 
When I woke, the waves had gone black, 
turning over the macerated 
curd of the ocean bottom, heaving its sludge 
onto the beach. Some storm far out, I thought, 
had ravaged the sea, stirred up its bed, 
sent the whole mess flying to shore. 
At my feet I found a grave of starfish, 
broken and gnarled among the fleshy 
snipes and heads. Every shade of death 
covered the sand. It looked hopeless 
in the pale day but for the birds, 
a congress of gulls, terns, and the rarest plovers, 
calm for once, satiated, a measure of 
the one law: this sea will claim it allâ€” 
feed them, catch them, grind their complicated bones.

How something is made flesh
 no one can say. The buffalo soup
 becomes a woman
 who sings every day to her horses
 or summons another to her private body
 saying come, touch, this is how
 it begins, the path of a newly born
 who, salvaged from other lives and worlds,
 will grow to become a woman, a man,
 with a heart that never rests,
 and the gathered berries,
 the wild grapes
 enter the body,
 human wine
 which can love,
 where nothing created is wasted;
 the swallowed grain
 takes you through the dreams
 of another night,
 the deer meat becomes hands 
 strong enough to work.
  
 But I love most
 the white-haired creature
 eating green leaves;
 the sun shines there
 swallowed, showing in her face
 taking in all the light,
  
 and in the end
 when the shadow from the ground
 enters the body and remains,
 in the end, you might say,
 This is myself
 still unknown, still a mystery.

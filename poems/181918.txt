text : 
He stopped part way across the field to 
sit down and rest. An eagle 
descended from the sky and an angel with the face of death 

Before I had a name 
I came out of a place where there wasn’t a door 
holding my breath 

in slippery hands. Door to wall 
and back again. The things these were   
The modified currents of air 

at which the dancers are taught to stare 
whenever they turn 
to go but instead fall over 

at the idea of taking an ordinary walk 
for example to the Post Office 
or a restaurant. And all the original atoms 

of water and skin 
we think we can find there 
if we try. This is not Alaska 

and the sun-dial   
is not the sun secretly dying 
during the night

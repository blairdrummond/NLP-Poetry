title : To a Marsh Hawk in Spring

author : Henry David Thoreau

text : 
There is health in thy gray wing,
Health of natureâ€™s furnishing.
Say, thou modern-winged antique,
Was thy mistress ever sick?
In each heaving of thy wing
Thou dost health and leisure bring,
Thou dost waive disease and pain
And resume new life again.

title : “I never seen such days as this”

author : Sholeh Wolpé

text : 
—Bahram (Pakistani 14-year-old held in an Afghan prison) 
Like the pied piper
 the mullah drives his battered truck
 through dusty villages, his loudspeaker
 singing: Join the battle against the infidels.
 Fight for Jihad and live eternally with Allah.
 Lift up your guns for Him and you shall never die.

 Barefoot boys ragged, hungry
 from years of hard soil, follow him
 dancing into the straps of loaded guns,
 pirouetting into caves and broken buildings

 And the boys end up in a land not their own
 but are told God is everywhere.
 Many die. Others disappear
 into dark prison bowels
 where each day if you are 12, twelve filthy men
 one after another . . .
 if you are 14, then fourteen is your lot.
  
 A father sells tea from a cart,
 one cup at a time, washes the tiles
 of a mosque with a yellow bar of soap
 to earn the ransom the soldiers exact. 

 Every night in his dreams his son stands, calling:
 Father, I never seen such days as this.

The animals are leaving 
the safety of the trees 

Light sensors respond 
to the footfall of every guest 

To retard the growth of algae 

The fishes must be moved 
from the window 

Stiller than water she lies 
As in a glass dress 

As if all life might come to its end 
within the radius of her bed 

Beyond the reef of trees a beach cannot be seen 
the bay itself barely breathing 

In the other wing of the house 
a small boat awaits elucidation

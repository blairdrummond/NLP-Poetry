title : I Am Learning To Abandon the World

author : Linda Pastan

text : 
I am learning to abandon the world 
before it can abandon me. 
Already I have given up the moon 
and snow, closing my shades 
against the claims of white. 
And the world has taken 
my father, my friends. 
I have given up melodic lines of hills, 
moving to a flat, tuneless landscape. 
And every night I give my body up 
limb by limb, working upwards 
across bone, towards the heart. 
But morning comes with small 
reprieves of coffee and birdsong. 
A tree outside the window 
which was simply shadow moments ago 
takes back its branches twig 
by leafy twig. 
And as I take my body back 
the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap 
as if to make amends.

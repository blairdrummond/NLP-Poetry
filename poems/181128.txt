title : Dear Mr. Fanelli,

author : Charles Bernstein

text : 
I saw your picture 
in the 79th street 
station. You said 
you’d be interested 
in any comments I 
might have on the 
condition of the 
station Mr. Fanelli, 
there is a lot of 
debris in the 79th street 
station that makes it 
unpleasant to wait in 
for more than a few 
minutes. The station 
could use a paint 
job and maybe 
new speakers so you 
could understand 
the delay announcements 
that are always being 
broadcast. Mr. 
Fanelli—there are 
a lot of people sleeping 
in the 79th street station 
& it makes me sad 
to think they have no 
home to go to. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think 
you could find a more 
comfortable place for them 
to rest? It’s pretty noisy 
in the subway, especially 
all those express trains 
hurtling through every 
few minutes, anyway when the 
trains are in service. 
I have to admit, Mr. Fanelli, I 
think the 79th street station’s 
in pretty bad shape 
& sometimes at night 
as I toss in my bed 
I think the world’s 
not doing too good 
either, & I 
wonder what’s going 
to happen, where we’re 
headed, if we’re 
headed anywhere, if 
we even have heads. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think if 
we could just start 
with the 79th street 
station & do what 
we could with that 
then maybe we could, 
you know, I guess, move 
on from there? Mr. 
Fanelli, when I saw your 
picture & the sign 
asking for suggestions 
I thought, if 
you really wanted to 
get to the bottom 
of what’s wrong then 
maybe it was my job 
to write to you: Maybe 
you’ve never been inside 
the 79th street station 
because you’re so busy 
managing the 72nd street 
& 66th street stations, 
maybe you don’t know 
the problems we have 
at 79th—I mean the 
dirt & frequent 
delays & the feeling of 
total misery that 
pervades the place. Mr. 
Fanelli, are you reading 
this far in the letter 
or do you get so 
many letters every day 
that you don’t have 
time to give each 
one the close attention 
it desires? Or am I 
the only person who’s 
taken up your invitation 
to get in touch & 
you just don’t have enough 
experience to know how to 
respond? I’m sorry 
I can’t get your attention 
Mr. Fanelli because I really 
believe if you ask 
for comments then you 
ought to be willing 
to act on them—even 
if ought is too 
big a word to throw 
around at this point. 
Mr. Fanelli 
I hope you won’t 
think I’m rude 
if I ask you a 
personal question. Do 
you get out of the 
office much? 
Do you go to the movies 
or do you prefer 
sports—or maybe 
quiet evenings at a 
local restaurant? Do 
you read much, Mr. Fanelli? 
I don’t mean just 
Gibbons and like 
that, but philosophy— 
have you read much 
Hanna Arendt or 
do you prefer 
a more ideological 
perspective? 
I think if I understood 
where you are coming from, 
Mr. Fanelli, I could 
write to you more cogently, 
more persuasively. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you get out 
of the city at all—I 
mean like up to Bear 
Mountain or out to 
Montauk? I mean do you 
notice how unpleasant 
the air is in the 79th 
street station—that we 
could use some cooling 
or air-filtering system 
down there? Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think 
it’s possible we 
could get together 
and talk about 
these things in 
person? There are 
a few other points 
I’d like to go over 
with you if I could 
get the chance. Things 
I’d like to talk to 
you about but that 
I’d be reluctant to 
put down on paper. 
Mr. Fanelli, I haven’t 
been feeling very good 
lately and I thought 
meeting with you face 
to face might change 
my mood, might put 
me into a new frame 
of mind. Maybe we 
could have lunch? 
Or maybe after work? 
Think about it, Mr. 
Fanelli.

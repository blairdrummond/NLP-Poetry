“Stephen Smith, University of Iowa sophomore, burned what he said was his draft card” 
and Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself. 
You, Robert McNamara, burned what you said was a concentration 
of the Enemy Aggressor. 
No news medium troubled to put it in quotes. 

And Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself. 
He said it with simple materials such as would be found in your kitchen. 
In your office you were informed. 
Reporters got cracking frantically on the mental disturbance angle. 
So far nothing turns up. 

Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned, and while burning, screamed. 
No tip-off. No release. 
Nothing to quote, to manage to put in quotes. 
Pity the unaccustomed hesitance of the newspaper editorialists.   
Pity the press photographers, not called. 

Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned and was burned and said 
all that there is to say in that language. 
Twice what is said in yours. 
It is a strange sect, Mr. McNamara, under advice to try   
the whole of a thought in silence, and to oneself.

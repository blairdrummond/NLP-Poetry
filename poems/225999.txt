title : Grandfather

In 1915 my grandfather’s 
neighbors surrounded his house 
near the dayline he ran 
on the Hudson 
in Catskill, NY 
and thought they’d burn 
his family out 
in a movie they’d just seen 
and be rid of his kind: 
the death of a lone black 
family is the Birth 
of a Nation, 
or so they thought. 
His 5’4” waiter gait 
quenched the white jacket smile 
he’d brought back from watered 
polish of my father 
on the turning seats, 
and he asked his neighbors 
up on his thatched porch 
for the first blossom of fire 
that would bring him down. 
They went away, his nation, 
spittooning their torched necks 
in the shadows of the riverboat 
they’d seen, posse decomposing; 
and I see him on Sutter 
with white bag from your 
restaurant, challenged by his first 
grandson to a foot-race 
he will win in white clothes. 

I see him as he buys galoshes 
for his railed yard near Mineo’s 
metal shop, where roses jump 
as the el circles his house 
toward Brooklyn, where his rain fell; 
and I see cigar smoke in his eyes, 
chocolate Madison Square Garden chews 
he breaks on his set teeth, 
stitched up after cancer, 
the great white nation immovable 
as his weight wilts 
and he is on a porch 
that won’t hold my arms, 
or the legs of the race run 
forwards, or the film 
played backwards on his grandson’s eyes.

title : Song in Barbarous Fumarole of the Japanese Crested Ibis

The wings pierce as if they were eternity.  —Shuzo Takiguchi  The Japanese Crested Ibis is now extinct.
“To claim as arcane vapour 
ruination by intrigue 
by kindled leprosy morays 
so that I take up in my glottis 
these moral hallucinogens which actively dim 
which nourish themselves on behalf of active heavenly terror 

as if forking my verbs with cryptography 
with bird interrogation 
with a haunted crystallography of deception 
mentally cross-fertilized with defective aural lobotomies   
so that I momentarily sing 
with a cosmic catch in my wings 

floating above 
a black waterfall of rye 
dazzled by partial torments 
by seeming in-seminal scatterings   
by snow in smoking germinal mazes 

it could be said that my blood has been scorched 
by intensive Venusian plasma   
by updrafts of wheat 
by molecules that slaughter 
my throat continuously parched   
by wild in-secular genetics   
by unfiltered parchment   
by incipient nerve cuisines   
empowered by listless cranial singing 
carving androgynous shapes with my voice 
me 
an ominous fluttering angel   
kept aloft by diagrams 
of smouldering electrical truth 

as a tempestuous solar charisma 
I can never speak in terms of oceanic remorse 
or with the temperament of fictitious remedial doves 

no 
I am heightened by sudden sociological flaws   
by prisms of seasoned parallel tornadoes 

though shattered by various Saxon devices 
I am the flame throughout the soaring absolute   
I denigrate 
I take on sanguine territorial opposition   
with a force 
enriched 
with untoward fertility 
with a dominate tendency to waver 
with excessive a-regional metrics 
with inhaled phantasmics 
spilled on fortuitous migrational soils 
there is ermine 
there is discourse by nugget 
there is scarification by increase 

each of my echoes spinning through pictographic parabolas   
graphic 
with indecisive incest 
which abstractly reduces 
which plummets 
into the frothing systemic of bees 

a crepuscular arachnoidal utterance by sun bells   
by pestilential archive 
by vivid tourmaline exposure 

there is expressed interstice   
flotational temperature by prophet   
by sun exposed Greek 

therefore 
a palace erected in bone plazas 
to worship each grainy avian heaven   
each tumultuous spire by detraction   
so that there exists the one true clarity   
the cloudy singular beam 
more blinding than sun noons on Mercury 

pinnacle by rot 
by hovering phoneme & tremor 
by sorcerous frigate & plasma 
by flaming interior sign 
by defenseless grenadine morals 
as with Enoch* 
I continue my metamorphosis 
singing in capsized tarantula tree 
melodramatic by despair 
cogitation by a sense of entrapment   
split along the cusp of a-tonal meridians 

each guttural burst 
struggling at great odds 
at hieroglyphical knife point 
dazed with magnetic electrical fuchsia 

each of my wingbeats as death   
as co-existent termination   
as spoiled rudiment by colour 

so I splice my lamentations   
& open the diachronic 
to spawned confusional rotations   
amidst the equator of sundogs   
heated by corrupted memorial sparks 

my beak aligned with cryptographic cunning 
with tantric scratches inside my steaming ink well treaties   
my aggressions in tune 
with an aching heraldic nopal 
its coronal glare 
flashing upon a-clinical watery mnemonics 
filled with carnivorous morphine & diamonds 

flying in Bardo* 
above the scattered wrath of oneiric sesame pontoons   
eclectic with my knowledge 
of furious marginal germs & diseases 
hyper-extended with discord 
those bony schismatic ghosts 
fused by synchronic retinal burning 
drawing from the sky 
a milk 
seasoned with phlogiston & Hittite galvanics 

yes 
chandas flecked* 
with sulphurous heretical clauses 

because 
I deny 
& re-invigourate 
I tear down 
I re-pontificate 
the bile from empty animal invasions 

breaking through poisoned civil cataleptics   
entangling quotidian farm worlds   
with my traitorous acids 
culled 
from a barbarous daily wine 

here I am 
winged 
with oracular sun-dust flowers 
my eyes scattered into translated demon   
like a blue demonic spy 
sailing across transparent carrion planes   
so as to re-inhabit the dead 
so as to scan the weightless centigrade margins 

in one simple respiration 
I summon the tendencies of electrocuted corpses   
the stony wrath 
of drowned Phoenician sailors 

my voice drills 
with North Asian alewahs* 
akin to compounded rock points on Vesta or Ceres 

yes 
I drain from stars pre-glottal alluviums 
moth ceramics   
a chalice of rote   
pestles shaped 
by incipient hulls of deadly carbon grains 

I sing 
across distracted ingress baying   
with sounds 
not even the dead can decipher 

I can only increase funeric confusion   
the invisible force which uplifts the void   
which ingests the force of negation & mirage 

yet I sculpt 
in weakened anti-negation 
spasms rampant with fire 
distorting by quotidian thumb piano 

by plagues which sustain gregarious verbal gestation   
subsumed from susurrations extracted from the scattered   
logistics of Titans 
from the fevered optical beams 
spilled from greenish sundial eternities 

Ramses* 
or Hatshepsut* 
or Akhenaton* 
invading as cherished cyclical spores   
their luminescence by blankness   
by swarming alchemical moons   
by bewildering errata 
as in rum by higher being 
by serpentine 
& flowing whiplash ideology 

above all 
I’ve cosmically transmuted the atmospheric bone   
the dementia enveloped by protest 
by turquoise weight 
& somnific solar inclusion 
singing by eclipse torrent 
by waves of flame erupting from mirrors & dreams of post- 
extinction 

a geneaology of circles   
beyond aphids’ scribbling 
& logical strontium dialectic 

my bleeding unbearable shadows   
brewing 
a sumptuous fever of poetic electrical charisma   
its lightning shafts 
of snow & rum & blood 
mixed with the grains 
of stunning axial omegas”

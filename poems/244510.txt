title : Dear Reader

author : Rita Mae Reese

text : 
You have forgotten it all.
 You have forgotten your name,
 where you lived, who you
 loved, why.
                       I am simply
 your nurse, terse and unlovely
 I point to things
 and remind you what they are:
 chair, book, daughter, soup.
  
 And when we are alone
 I tell you what lies
 in each direction: This way
 is death, and this way, after
 a longer walk, is death,
 and that way is death but you
 won’t see it
 until it is right
 in front of you.
  
               Once after
 your niece had been to visit you
 and I said something about
 how you must love her
 or she must love you
 or something useless like that,
 you gripped my forearm
 in your terrible swift hand
 and said, she is
 everything—you gave
 me a shake—everything
 to me.
                And then you fell
 back into the well. Deep
 in the well of everything. And I
 stand at the edge and call:
                   chair, book, daughter, soup.

title : The Prediction

author : Mark Strand

text : 
That night the moon drifted over the pond,   
turning the water to milk, and under   
the boughs of the trees, the blue trees,   
a young woman walked, and for an instant 

the future came to her: 
rain falling on her husband’s grave, rain falling   
on the lawns of her children, her own mouth 
filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house, 

a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it,   
a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death, 
thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising 
and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.

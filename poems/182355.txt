for my sisters
Because we did not have threads 
of turquoise, silver, and gold, 
we could not sew a sun nor sky. 
And our hands became balls of fire. 
And our arms spread open like wings. 

Because we had no chalk or pastels, 
no toad, forest, or morning-grass slats 
of paper, we had no colour 
for creatures. So we squatted 
and sprang, squatted and sprang. 

Four young girls, plaits heavy 
on our backs, our feet were beating 
drums, drawing rhythms from the floor; 
our mouths became woodwinds; 
our tongues touched teeth and were reeds.

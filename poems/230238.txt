oh antic God 
return to me 
my mother in her thirties   
leaned across the front porch   
the huge pillow of her breasts   
pressing against the rail 
summoning me in for bed. 

I am almost the dead woman’s age times two. 

I can barely recall her song 
the scent of her hands 
though her wild hair scratches my dreams   
at night.   return to me, oh Lord of then   
and now, my mother’s calling, 
her young voice humming my name.

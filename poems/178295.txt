title : Private Eye Lettuce

author : Richard Brautigan

text : 
Three crates of Private Eye Lettuce, 
the name and drawing of a detective 
with magnifying glass on the sides 
of the crates of lettuce, 
form a great cross in man’s imagination 
and his desire to name   
the objects of this world. 
I think I’ll call this place Golgotha 
and have some salad for dinner.

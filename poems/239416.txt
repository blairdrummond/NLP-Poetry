text : 
My leaf blower lifted the blackbirdâ€” 
wings still spread, weightless, 
floating on the loud, electric wind 
almost as if it were alive.

Three or four times it flew, 
but fell again, sideslipped down 
like a kite with no string, 
so I gave up. . . I had work to do,

and when the dust I raised 
had settled in that other world 
under the rose bushes, the ants 
came back to finish theirs.

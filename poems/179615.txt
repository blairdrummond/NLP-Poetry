title : homage to my hips

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
these hips are big hips 
they need space to 
move around in. 
they don't fit into little 
petty places. these hips 
are free hips. 
they don't like to be held back. 
these hips have never been enslaved,   
they go where they want to go 
they do what they want to do. 
these hips are mighty hips. 
these hips are magic hips. 
i have known them 
to put a spell on a man and 
spin him like a top!

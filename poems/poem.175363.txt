Sonnet

I: THE MOTOR: 1905 

From hedgerows where aromas fain would be 
    New volleyed odours execrably arise; 
    The flocks, with hell-smoke in their patient eyes, 
Into the ditch from bawling ruin flee: 
Spindrift of one abominated sea 
    Along all roads in wrecking fury flies 
    Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that dies, 
In this far plot it writes a rune for me. 

Vast intimate tyranny! Nature dispossessed 
    Helplessly hates thee, whose symbolic flare 
Lights up (with what reiterance unblest!) 
    Entrails of horror in a world thought fair. 
False God of pastime thou, vampire of rest, 
    Augur of what pollution, what despair?

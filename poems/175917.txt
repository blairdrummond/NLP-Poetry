“must represent the governess   
for, of course, the creature itself   
could not inspire such terror.” 

staring at me fixedly, no   
trace of recognition. 

“when the window opened of its own accord.   
In the big walnut tree 
were six or seven wolves ... 

strained attention. They were white.”   

(The fear of cloudy skies.) 

like strangers! After five years 

Misgiving. Misdoubt.

(The fear that one is dreaming.) 

The moon was shining, suddenly   
everything around me appeared   
(The fear of) 
unfamiliar. 

Wild vista 
inside or near the home. 

(Dread of bearing a monster.) 

If I failed to overlook the torn cushions, 

three teapots side by side,   
strewn towels, socks, papers— 

both foreign and stale.

when I saw the frame was rotten,   
crumbling away from the glass, 
in spots, in other places still attached   
with huge globs of putty. 

The doctor forced me to repeat the word.   

Chimera. Cold feet. 

scared and unreal looking at buildings.   
The thin Victorians with scaly paint,   
their flimsy backporches linked 
by skeletal stairways.

After five years 

(The fear that you are not at home.) 

I was sitting in the alcove where I never sit   
when I noticed a single eye, 

crudely drawn in pencil,   
in a corner near the floor. 

The paint was blistering— 
beneath it I saw white.

Sparrows settle on the sagging wires.   

(Fear of sights not turned to words.) 

Horrific. Grisly.   
“Rumplestiltskin!” 

Not my expression. 

Not my net of veins   
beneath thin skin. 

(A morbid dread of throbbing.)   

Of its own accord

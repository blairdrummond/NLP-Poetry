Here is the kingdom of irregulars, 
land of no-two-alike, 
I hunt furiously 
useful towels. Closets simmering with 
terry, linen, beach or tea 
can never be full 
enough to stop these sprees. 

Hoarding is relative 
to love or fear, but not to need. Mother stockpiled 
soap in step-on cans. 
When the lid snapped back, 
instead of grinds, grease, skins, it was good 
to get a whiff 
of the bars, neat and brightly wrapped as gifts. 

Waving us off on dates, she'd yell "Be back by twelve 
and don't come home 
if you get killed." But I wasn't killed, 
easy as that seemed. I hadn't figured on 
life's pigheadedness: 
how the breath and pulse are triggered by a hardwon 
inability to unexist. How death is 

tightfisted. I thought 
at first there'd been a car crash: my voice soared, brilliant 
and bubbling with drugs: oh, that that too too 
euphoric 
stutter should be mine! 
Then, with a coziness worse than constraint, they 
spoke of the cerebral pinch I'd been in, praised 

the luck that chucked me 
back to sanitized light. Where towels absorb their weight 
in chaos. Where I am serene. 
Like those damn orchids— 
vivid, blizzardy sprays Tom and I trucked 
out West that time, and, one by one, heat or dark 
got them: my brainwaves. 

The last was that dendrobium...or is 
that my medication? See? Last week I went 
and rang the wrong bell 
after twenty-odd years of visiting 
my beaming, well-meaning sister. 
I worry now 
about another sister who manages neither 

smiles nor meaning. Those years I coaxed her through 
treatments, hoping— 
if not for her thanks or love, then what? 
Nothing...but the nothing I've received 
has me shuddering. 
Rage makes my blood astringent as witch hazel. 
I'll pretend not to see them pretend not to 

see my infirmities: 
My restless hands. Idling. Pilling the spread. 
Of course, you can get killed at home and that's something 
Mother never mentioned. My mind drifts 
to my friend Miriam, that deadly fire—I see again 
her pleasant, stocky face. "Mada, we're sharp 
as ever," she said last time, 

but she was fooled. With luck she slept right through. 
Outside snowflakes lift, float sideways, and seem 
to say "ground has nothing 
to do with me!" But this is silly. 
Though I can't trace one among the calm bustle 
of shoppers, I tell myself 
they are falling, they do touch earth, and they 


never rise at all.

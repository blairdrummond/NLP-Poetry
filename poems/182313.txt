title : Cage

author : Josephine Miles

text : 
Through the branches of the Japanese cherry 
Blooming like a cloud which will rain 
A rain white as the sun 
The living room across the roadway 
Cuts its square of light 
And in it fight 
Two figures, hot, irate, 
Stuck between sink and sofa in that golden cage. 
Come out into the night, walk in the night, 
It is for you, not me. 
The cherry flowers will rain their rain as white 
Cool as the moon.   
Listen how they surround. 
You swing among them in your cage of light. 
Come out into the night.

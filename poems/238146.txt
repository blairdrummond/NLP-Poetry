The vote came in early. We ignored
   it. No ballout-box auction for us...
Nub’s uninstructed dance’s bare
     feet, music we took them for.
                                                At a
 loss with only bodies to fend with,
  nonsonant waves kept coming,
sang without wind,      saltless,
     waterless,      Nub’s inverted
 run, Nub newly vented by horns
                                                blown
   elsewhere, bells full of insect
     husks... Nonsonant scruff held
 on to, sheerness... Nothingness
  it seemed we grabbed at, gathered,
beginning to be unending it seemed.
                                                      We
   were beginning to be lured again,
ready to be hectored, huthered, move
  on, beginning to be uprooted again...

    A peppered expanse the country we
crossed. Space doled out so stingily
      we wept, love’s numb extremity
  the outskirts of Nuh, name whose
                                                    elision
     we embraced... A tale told many
times over, known before it reached
       us, known before we knew, un-
     backed alley of soul we wandered
                                                       into,
       shadowbox romance it was called...
    Come of late to creation’s outskirts,
  rub’s new muse a republic of none, a
       yet-to-be band the band we were...
     We were Andoumboulou, dreamt
                                                      in-
      habitants of “mu,” moored but
 immersed, real but made up, so much
     farther flung than we’d have thought...
    They the would-be we lay on a bed
  the size of Outlandish. Lip attesting
        lip, tongue rummaging tongue,
                                                      took
      between finger and thumb the hem 
    of her dress, flat bead of sweat, salted
                                                             cloth...
       A hammer hit them each on the head.
     Hammered heads rang and rang without
  end...      Called it creation, called it
   their clime, close where there was otherwise
       distance,      mute endearment,      recondite
     embrace... So much farther, felt even
                                                            so,
mouth she remembered, home. His to hear
     her tell it, hers were it his to say, whose
   book was of lengthening limbs, hers of
                                                            the
 unquenchable kiss... A tale told over and
                                                             over,
    long since known by heart. Lay belly to
  back, turned belly to belly, each the other’s
dreamt accompanist, music they made in
 their sleep... Frayed hem the interstice,
                                                           time’s
    moot rule. Time’s moot rule amended,
                                                            echoed
  advance it was
also called

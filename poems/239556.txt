title : . . . (In Exion)

author : Jennifer Scappettone

text : 
can walk without
 a frame, he
 whose exions last
  
 and saw into
 limbs livid still
 the sum, comic,
  
 dome-hosting wall shop
 captivating everything in
 a proleptic sale
  
 while sand-horse negotiates
 his clop versus
 some floor one
  
 erected in ardor
 prostrate again and
 happy penultimate slough-opening
  
 as the news
 that distracts from
 spectral sass, downing
  
 darkling you weren’t 
 personal last Saturday
 as ponies cyclical
  
 laced the public
 grasses compulsorily before
 our bower got
  
 scanned despite a 
 standup’s lawnly heath
 and harebells having
  
 become grammar’s shortage
 on the stage 
 hussing up to
  
 a cardboard cloud
 passed limb from
 limb without its
  
                                             flame

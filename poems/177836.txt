text : 
her grandmother called her from the playground   
       “yes, ma’am” 
       “i want chu to learn how to make rolls” said the old   
woman proudly 
but the little girl didn’t want 
to learn how because she knew 
even if she couldn’t say it that 
that would mean when the old one died she would be less   
dependent on her spirit so 
she said 
       “i don’t want to know how to make no rolls” 
with her lips poked out 
and the old woman wiped her hands on 
her apron saying “lord 
       these children” 
and neither of them ever 
said what they meant 
and i guess nobody ever does

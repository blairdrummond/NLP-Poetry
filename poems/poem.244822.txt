Poems for Weddings



By a peninsula the painter sat and
 Sketched the uneven valley groves.
 The apostle gave alms to the
 Meek. The volcano burst
 In fusive sulphur and hurled 
 Rocks and ore into the air--
 Heaven's sudden change at
 The drawing tempestuous,
 Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.
 The wanderer soon chose
 His spot of rest; they bore the 
 Chosen hero upon their shoulders,
 Whom they strangely admired, as
 The beach-tide summer of people desired.

text : 
Your mother’s in the kitchen and out
 and in again. It’s all about them.
  
 They’ve taken over like the dark cloud
 hanging low over the back yard,
  
 a fat aunt coming in for a hug.
 Enough’s enough. The door opens:
  
 new guests flow in as the old
 back you up like mangroves.
  
 Why get dressed up to stay in?
 Pretend to befriend other children
  
 because they have been dumped next to you?
 Resistance, then fire, then to your room
  
 without toys. Later, it’ll be the boys
 to whom your friends will cater,
  
 seem to love best. Such is the fate
 of the steadfast: you’ll never be a guest.

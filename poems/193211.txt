title : Immured

author : Lily A. Long

text : 
Within this narrow cell that I call "me", 
       I was imprisoned ere the worlds began, 
       And all the worlds must run, as first they ran,   
In silver star-dust, ere I shall be free.   
I beat my hands against the walls and find   
It is my breast I beat, O bond and blind!

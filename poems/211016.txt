title : On the Eve of a Birthday

author : Timothy Steele

text : 
As my Scotch, spared the water, blondly sloshes 
About its tumbler, and gay manic flame 
Is snapping in the fireplace, I grow youthful: 
I realize that calendars aren’t truthful
And that for all of my grand unsuccesses 
External causes are to blame.

And if at present somewhat destitute, 
I plan to alter, prove myself more able, 
And suavely stroll into the coming years 
As into rooms with thick rugs, chandeliers, 
And colorfully pyramided fruit
On linened lengths of table.

At times I fear the future won’t reward 
My failures with sufficient compensation, 
But dump me, aging, in a garret room 
Appointed with twilit, slant-ceilinged gloom 
And a lone bulb depending from a cord 
Suggestive of self-strangulation.

Then, too, I have bad dreams, in one of which 
A cowled, scythe-bearing figure beckons me. 
Dark plains glow at his back: it seems I’ve died, 
And my soul, weighed and judged, has qualified 
For an extended, hyper-sultry hitch
Down in eternity.

Such fears and dreams, however, always pass. 
And gazing from my window at the dark, 
My drink in hand, I’m jauntily unbowed.
The sky’s tiered, windy galleries stream with cloud, 
And higher still, the dazed stars thickly mass 
In their long Ptolemaic arc.

What constellated powers, unkind or kind, 
Sway me, what far preposterous ghosts of air? 
Whoever they are, whatever our connection, 
I toast them (toasting also my reflection),
Not minding that the words which come to mind 
Make the toast less toast than prayer:

Here’s to the next year, to the best year yet; 
To mixed joys, to my harum-scarum prime; 
To auguries reliable and specious;
To times to come, such times being precious, 
If only for the reason that they get
Shorter all the time.

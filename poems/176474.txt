‘Talbingo River’—as one says of bones:   
‘Captain’ or ‘Commodore’ that smelt gunpowder   
In old engagements no one quite believes   
Or understands. Talbingo had its blood 
As they did, ran with waters huge and clear   
Lopping down mountains, 
Turning crags to banks. 

Now it’s a sort of aching valley,   
Basalt shaggy with scales, 
A funnel of tobacco-coloured clay,   
Smoulders of puffed earth 
And pebbles and shell-bodied flies 
And water thickening to stone in pocks. 

That’s what we’re like out here,   
Beds of dried-up passions.

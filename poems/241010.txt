title : As I Cross the Heliopause at Midnight, I Think of My Mission

Drunker than Voyager I
 but not as Voyager 2 I rode my blue
 bike back through the darkness
 to my lonely geode cave of light
 awaiting nothing under the punctured
 dome. I had achieved escape
 velocity drinking clear liquid starlight
 at the Thunderbird with a fingerless
 Russian hedge fund inspector and one
 who called himself The Champ. All
 night I felt fine crystals cutting 
 my lips like rising up through
 a hailstorm. And the great vacuum
 cleaner that cannot be filled moved
 through my chest, gathering
 conversation dust and discharging
 it through my borehole. During
 one of many silences The Champ
 took off his face and thus were many
 gears to much metallic laughter
 revealed. Long ago I forgot
 the word which used to mean in truth
 but now expresses disbelief. So
 quickly did my future come. You who 
 are floating past me on your inward way,
 please inform those glowing faces
 who first gave me this shove I have 
 managed to rotate my brilliant
 golden array despite their instructions.

Sonnet

Nothing is so beautiful as Spring -          
   When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;          
   Thrush's eggs look little low heavens, and thrush          
Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring          
The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing; 
   The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush          
   The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush          
With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.          

What is all this juice and all this joy?          
   A strain of the earth's sweet being in the beginning 
In Eden garden. - Have, get, before it cloy,          
   Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,          
Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,          
   Most, O maid's child, thy choice and worthy the winning.

					1  Cloven, we are incorporate, our wounds simple but mysterious. We have some wherewithal to bide our time on earth. Endurance is fantastic; ambulances battling at intersections, the city intolerably en fÃªte. My reflexes are words themselves rather than standard flexures of civil power. In all of this Cassiopeia's a blessing as is steady Orion beloved of poets. Quotidian natures ours for the time being I do not know how we should be absolved or what is fate.  2  Fame is not fastidious about the lips which spread it. So long as there are mouths to reiterate the one name it does not matter whose they are. The fact that to the seeker after fame they are indistinguishable from each other and are all counted as equal shows that this passion has its origin in the experience of crowd manipulation. Names collect their own crowds. They are greedy, live their own separate lives, hardly at all connected with the real natures of the men who bear them.  3  But hear this: that which is difficult preserves democracy; you pay respect to the intelligence of the citizen. Basics are not condescension. Some tyrants make great patrons. Let us observe this and pass on. Certain directives parody at your own risk. Tread lightly with personal dignity and public image. Safeguard the image of the common man.

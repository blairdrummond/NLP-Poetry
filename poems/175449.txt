title : What Is Impossible

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
About the age of twenty, when the first hairfall 
signals that nature is finished with the organism 
and we just begin to conceive the use of women 
(having been all this time 
more enamored of the fountain than the cistern), 
we retire to nursing homes, 
whether they be kaleidoscopic gardens 
aimed like a blunderbuss of hermeticism at our neighbors, 
or a desperate dream safari through old Zambesi, 
where the suicidal waves of angry natives 
give the illusion that we are advancing rapidly, 
or the crowâ€™s-nest of this windless office block 
where the cook is already boiling the last sail. 

And sitting on the bench like a snowfall of beard 
expectorated by a cloudy hat, 
we consider the byproducts of life, 
such as (to name only the least offensive to the nose) 
the body itself when it has finally reached 
that eminence from which all is visible 
and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move on 
to a homestead of its dreams like an abandoned chicken coop 
on the sandy streamside under the tulip poplars, 
and to words, which result from an instinct 
for what is impossible: 
to soften the blow for others, including ourselves.

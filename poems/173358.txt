title : The Funeral

author : John Donne

text : 
Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm 
         Nor question much 
That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm; 
The mystery, the sign, you must not touch, 
         For 'tis my outward soul, 
Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone, 
         Will leave this to control 
And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution. 

For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall 
         Through every part 
Can tie those parts, and make me one of all, 
Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art 
         Have from a better brain, 
Can better do'it; except she meant that I 
         By this should know my pain, 
As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die. 

Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me, 
         For since I am 
Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry, 
If into other hands these relics came; 
         As 'twas humility 
To afford to it all that a soul can do, 
         So, 'tis some bravery, 
That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.

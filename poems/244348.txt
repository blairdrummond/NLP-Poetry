text : 
It was a forlorn eve,
                             my descent wintry.
                                                         In that foreign midnight,
  
  
 I sounded
                             the chanceries of doubt
                                                         as day drove up
  
  
 in an ordinary yellow cab.
                             To my astonishment,
                                                         I seemed to be blindfolded
  
  
 but the clock
                             —talk     talk— 
                                                         continuing called me,
  
  
 a voice ever stranger
                             in complaint.
                                                         With my staff I came
  
  
 to the first step,
                             sanguine indeed,
                                                         and dressed in a well-cut Western suit
  
  
 —quite the best I saw on anybody
                             during my whole stay
                                                         in that unstable regime.
  
  
 There were people in plots
                             bowing to creation.
                                                         Please I protested,
  
  
 I had not come to stay,
                             You will go in
                                                         said Nobody,
  
  
 all will be quiet.
                             I looked down
                                                         and could see thousands
  
  
 crowding into the grounds
                             —my     my— 
                                                         and climbed into the burial site.
  
  
 Within the twisted
                             rows of graves,
                                                         the teeth of under,
  
  
 some spoke of hatred
                             and some of hope.
                                                         Blind, they wept on command,
  
  
 in wheelchairs,
                             on crutches,
                                                         waving stumps.
  
  
 It was rather haunting—
                             the gates of shadows,
                                                         the path unlit,
  
  
 and ahead,
                             also dark,
                                                         an abandoned fortress.
  
  
 Carried along by the crowd,
                             our way lit by flashlights
                                                         through dim corridors,
  
  
 I said Citizens,
                             no     no.
                                                         Ahead, a door opened.
  
  
 I recognized the old council
                             sitting round a table,
                                                         some in religious collars,
  
  
 the atmosphere a court.
                             Chairing the proceeding,
                                                         a tall, bearded figure
  
  
 uttered a few words in German,
                             for my benefit.
                                                         He had lived for a time
  
  
 and remarked
                             that I needed
                                                         to be dealt with.
  
  
 Listening quietly,
                             I tried to avoid
                                                         any show of emotion.
  
  
 This clearly displeased him.
                             He seemed to expect me
                                                         to present my own commentary.
  
  
 I said in reply
                             the following,
                                                         shaken and uneasy,
  
  
 the slim thread of truth but little help . . .

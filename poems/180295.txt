title : [The happy ones are almost always also vulgar]

author : Patrizia Cavalli

text : 
The happy ones are almost always also vulgar; 
happiness has a way of thinking 
that's rushed and has no time to look 
but keeps on moving, compact and manic, 
with contempt in passing for the dying: 
Get on with your life, come on, buck up! 

Those stilled by pain don't mix 
with the cheerful, self-assured runners 
but with those who walk at the same slow pace. 
If one wheel locks and the other's turning 
the turning one doesn't stop turning 
but goes as far as it can, dragging the other 
in a poor, skewed race until the cart 
either comes to a halt or falls apart.

Free Verse

The red sun rises
without intent
and shines the same on all of us.
We play like children under the sun.
One day, our ashes will scatter--
                                           it doesn't matter when.
Now the sun finds our innermost hearts,
                                           fills us with oblivion
intense as the forest, winter and sea.

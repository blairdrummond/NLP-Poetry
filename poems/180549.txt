title : The Dead Remember Brooklyn

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
It is the great arguments 
we are proud of, over a nibbled peach, 
hair in the comb, a faulty lube job; 
the reconciliations were always naked 
in borrowed rooms, sometimes in Queens 
or Staten Island, we touched each other 
shyly—we reminded each other 
of loneliness and funk and beautiful pigeons 
with oil-slick necks, cooing bitterly— 
but there we lost each other 
in forgiveness; keeping score, 
being wounded even in triumph, 
walking home down leafy avenues 
etched with the faint double line 
of extinct trolleys, caressing 
carved hearts under a sheen of sap 
with a ragged nail, sleeping alone, 
choosing the dream of betrayal, 
entering by the wide door 
and waking dead—there 
we were superb. In Brooklyn 
we held our own.

title : Stenciled Memories

There was always fabric in your lap 
and a whistle in your heart. A sweet 
sap to be sucked waited in the garden. 
Nymphs of newts nestled under rock, 
your role as She Who Brings the Waters 
intact. Between the trilling of the crickets 
educating into the night and the sad sack 
of cans in the mornings something grew, 
flourished in the dark â€” vines as sturdy 
as telephone wire writhed in the breezes. 
You patched together a blanket of us, 
sewed together the mismatched and lopped 
off edges. And anger grew a twin, ripped 
through the bermuda grass, something stubborn 
and determined: Me, in a leather patchwork skirt, 
the bitter lemon song returning to its beginning 
over and over on the Howdie Doody phonograph, 
a handful of bandages, a faceful of ghosts 
delivered from the mirrors. How did you stand it? 
All of it. Us crunching through your set life, 
kids scuffling through the mounds of leave. 
Always making do. Your sunshine eyes, 
those stenciled memories where 
we still live.

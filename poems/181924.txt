title : Sonnet: Now I see them

author : Michael Palmer

text : 
Now I see them sitting me before a mirror. 
Thereâ€™s noise and laughter. Somebody 
mentions that hearing is silver 
before we move on to Table One 
with the random numbers. I look down 
a long street containing numbers. 
A white four leans against the fence 
and disappears. In the doorway 
is the seven, then the x 
painted red so you can find it 
more easily. Five goes by 
without its cap. My father wears 
the second x. He has a grey cloud 
for a face, and dark lines for arms.

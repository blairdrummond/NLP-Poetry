I couldn't have waited. By the time you return 
it would have rotted on the vine. 
So I cut the first tomato into eighths, 
salted the pieces in the dusk 
and found the flesh not mealy (like last year's) 
or bitter, 
even when I swallowed the green crown of the stem 
that made my throat feel dusty and warm. 

Pah. I could have gagged on the sweetness. 
The miser accused by her red sums. 
Better had I eaten the dirt itself 
on this the first night in my life 
when I have not been too busy for my lonelinessâ€” 
at last, it comes.

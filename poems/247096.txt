title : Lament —I

When I see the houses in this city, 
the electric gates and uniformed men 
employed to guard the riches of the rich, 
the gilded columns and gardens, 
the boats on water, I wonder, 
how to describe my home to you: 
the short, mud walls, 
the whispering roof, the veranda 
on which my whole family 
used to spread sheets and sleep.

The year I came to find work in the city, 
my wife painted our house white 
so it would be brighter than the neighbours'. 
I beat her for her foolishness. 
The children are hungry, I said, 
the cow is old,
the money collector is after my blood, 
and you steal like a magpie—
half a month's wage—to decorate 
your nest like a shiny jewel?

The monsoon finally arrived the year I left, 
dripped through the thatch, 
peeled paint off the walls. 
The wells grew full and overflowed. 
The farmers rejoiced in the fields. 
My son sat with his mouth open 
catching drops of water like a frog. 
My wife clung to the walls and wept.

When I fall asleep on the pavements
in this city, I try to imagine my wife's skin
against mine, the kohl in her eyes,
the white walls, the whole village sky
bearing down upon us
with all the weight of the stars.
I think of returning to that life,
but mostly I try to remember
how the world was once.
I want to open my mouth like my son,
and swallow things whole—
feel water filling all the voids,
until I am shaped back into existence.

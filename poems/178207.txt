text : 
They’re over now forever, the long dances.   
Our woods are quiet. The god is gone tonight.    
Our girls, good girls, have shaken off their trances.    
They’re over now forever, the long dances.    
Only the moonlight, sober and real, advances    
over our hills to touch my head with white.    
They’re over now forever, the long dances.    
Our woods are quiet. The god is gone tonight.

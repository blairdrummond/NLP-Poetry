Our God, our help in ages past, 
   Our hope for years to come, 
Our shelter from the stormy blast, 
   And our eternal home: 

Under the shadow of thy throne 
   Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
Sufficient is thine arm alone, 
   And our defense is sure. 

Before the hills in order stood 
   Or earth received her frame, 
From everlasting thou art God, 
   To endless years the same. 

Thy word commands our flesh to dust, 
   "Return, ye sons of men"; 
All nations rose from earth at first, 
   And turn to earth again. 

A thousand ages in thy sight 
   Are like an evening gone; 
Short as the watch that ends the night 
   Before the rising sun. 

The busy tribes of flesh and blood, 
   With all their lives and cares, 
Are carried downwards by thy flood, 
   And lost in following years. 

Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
   Bears all its sons away; 
They fly forgotten, as a dream 
   Dies at the opening day. 

Like flowery fields the nations stand, 
   Pleased with the morning light; 
The flowers beneath the mower's hand 
   Lie withering e'er 'tis night. 

Our God, our help in ages past, 
   Our hope for years to come, 
Be thou our guard while troubles last, 
   And our eternal home.

title : Way-Station

author : Archibald MacLeish

text : 
The incoherent rushing of the train   
Dulls like a drugged pain 

Numbs 
To an ether throbbing of inaudible drums 

Unfolds 
Hush within hush until the night withholds 

Only its darkness. 
                            From the deep   
Dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep 

Slowly a strange name in a strange tongue.   

Among 

The sleeping listeners a sound 
As leaves stir faintly on the ground 

When snow falls from a windless sky— 
A stir    A sigh

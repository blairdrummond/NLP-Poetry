Lapo Elkman gazes out from the frame with a
 come-hither look. His wrists have soft bracelets
 around them & his shirt, black, is open.
 Looped on his neck pale strands of beads hang
 which causes a ribbon of shadow at his nipple.
 His facial hair, bleached by the sun, is brown-white.
 Tatiana Santa Domingo wears a floral printed dress.
 It is summer where she’s photographed or
 warm enough for clothes that light. Earrings
 perhaps of three golden hoops or two
 hang obscured in the shade of her hair.
 Her right cheek is touching the locks of
 Bianca Brandolini d’Adda whose own dress
 is dim purple satin. It has a
 black strap of lace an inch thick
 which, at her waist, intersects with another
 lace band even thicker & full of arabesques
 & Fleur De Lis. This lace
 is just above her belly which is pressed
 to the belly of Margherita Maccapani Missoni.
 White, with faint, almost invisible as
 flowers (maybe dots?) her sundress,
 exposes her shoulder. The left one
 is touching the patterned black stars on the silk frock
 partly covered by spilling brown hair, at its longest end,
 curled & falling from the head of Alexi Neideliski.
 Andrea Stefanowicz Sabrier
 lays on his belly wearing Ray-Bands
 & is laughing. Beside him
 on his back, with arm muscles
 slightly swollen, hands clasped behind his head
 & eyes closed Julio Mario Santo Domingo III
 laughs as well. Both are in blue
 jeans & t-shirts. Her blue & black checkered
 flannel clad shoulder hovers over
 the face of her sister whose cheek is buried
 in wildflowers. Each wears a ring, one is
 a cylinder of patterned white gold
 the other, more baroque, appears Victorian
 but isn’t wholly visible.
 Olympia & Fiona Scarry are un-
 comfortably positioned in these clothes
 & rings. Olympia’s eyes are wide,
 bright, but Fiona’s are so full of shadow
 it seems they aren’t there which gives her
 the look of the un-dead. White wife beater,
 ample hair in his pits, crotch
 the center of gravity here in this picture
 Harry Morton is laying on a bed. One arm
 behind his head it’s tattooed almost classically,
 twice, with illegible symbols. His
 slacks have grey stripes, they pour into a boot
 pressed on the soft white sheet at the right
 at the left sink into a blood-colored
 comforter, velvet. The chocolate
 toned pea-coat he’s wearing half-way
 reveals a hand, it grips the hem
 near the satin-coco lining. She has the
 the face of a mermaid, & the eyes
 Princess in her title, Elizabeth von Thurn und Taxis
 looks poised before apporaching the coffin.
 Count Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo is giddy & drenched
 having waded in the sea in his button up clinging
 his smile is one that gods give their children after
 hooking up with mortals for the fix. On a half-pipe
 ornate with graffiti the honorable Sophia
 Fermor-Hesketh rests a skate-board on her knee
 in black tights. She wears Docs. Her hair is blonde,
 mostly covered by a hat her dress is lycra black this is
 Madonna as eternal return. Yellow seal with
 ingratiating smile, caterpillar-seal hybrid antennae
 blue, markings pink, body yellow, silver 
 dolphin, dolphin with desert-camo designs &
 dolphin dressed for jungle warfare these inflatables are
 harbored at the edge of a pool in which Bianca
 Brandolini D’Adda is floating on a sting-ray
 shaped raft on her belly hands under her chin
 three bracelets no bathing suit she’s swimming
 in her dress which is soaked & her legs are
 raised, ankles crossed this makes a diamond-
 shape between with liquid topaz. He has
 the cork in his teeth. In his left hand a half-
 glass of red. He is looking away at invisible friends & the
 ocean is beyond a grey mist with white
 bands Carlo Mondavi has hair
 that arcs at middle point a frozen cascade
 beneath which at right we see his ear half
 a sea-shell. The filigree is white, the
 buttons white impacted silk, the dots silk
 on sheer, on her blouse with short sleeves,
 she is blonde, her brother blonde his shirt
 white his scarf red she leans back on his chest
 his hand over his heart he takes an oath, Alexandre
 & Josephine de la Baume their lips closed
 eyes cold, unexpressive & imposing. JFK
 twice on a monitor his face & his back he
 is speaking Jared Kushner looks relaxed there’s
 a copy of the New York Observer on his knees
 which are bent he sits up against a
 wall smiles easily cropped black hair dark tie
 & slacks & white shirts by a window in the
 city. It’s a beach-house kitchen. Arnie Hammer’s
 by the sink. The head of his acoustic guitar
 nears its lip, & his ass sits near a rack where
 dishes dry there is one tiny elegant hole
 in his t-shirt, in his collar which is loose,
 low, reveals his long neck & hairy chest.
 The Corona in his right hand sweats. There is
 white foam all over my face which began in
 a canister, moved as blue-gel expelled by
 air-pressure then diluted with water was smeared
 on my cheeks, between my nose, lip
 & down onto my chin. I am shaving naked I 
 have three rolls of fat each bigger than
 the last. Looking in the mirror I cough, draw
the phlegm from my lungs with a suck roll
it onto my tongue stick my tongue out examine
 phlegm’s color for blood but there’s none it’s like mud-
 infused egg yolk. I spit it down into the sink with
 the little hairs spiking the cream. The cigarette
 pulls like a kite from her body on a long arm
 suspended by wind. Her tea-cup she holds it waist
 high & with one finger pins the fabric lightly
 to the bottom of the saucer. The cigarette ash
 is precarious her dress has five little shoelaces
 white at sternum’s end. Margherita
 Maccapani Missoni is happy. Sophia Barclay
 has a grey cardigan under which she wears a Disney
 dress. Hayley Bloomingdale is blonde she has
 a kerchief on her head a thin slice of melon
 in her fingers a white strand of pearls
 her bangs are one soft shard that hook her chin.
 She turns like she noticed us following her,
 & ready with her smile meets our eyes Ivanka
 Trump is moving, carefree, through the city. A young
 Thomas Jefferson, Adrea Casiraghi stares proudly at the future
 of the world & finds it splendid, brown hair cascading
 over his wool grey coat his white shirt reveals his
 marshmallow chest which contrasts with his granite
 chin & jaw. Dasha Duhkohva reclines on a
 marble table outlined by hydrangeas in jeans &
 striped shirt a grey trench coat thrown over her body.
 In a little row-boat, in a tank-top
 across which in marker has been written River
 Keeper Amanda Hearst crowned by a loose,
 densely beaded tiara. Black rubber fishing
 boots swallowed her legs. She’s drawing an
 enormous black tarp around her torso
 & smiling while her head tilts to the left.

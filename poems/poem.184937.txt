Sonnet

The hand and foot that stir not, they shall find 
Sooner than all the rightful place to go; 
Now in their motion free as roving wind, 
Though first no snail more limited and slow; 
I mark them full of labor all the day, 
Each active motion made in perfect rest; 
They cannot from their path mistaken stray, 
Though 'tis not theirs, yet in it they are blest; 
The bird has not their hidden track found out, 
Nor cunning fox, though full of art he be; 
It is the way unseen, the certain route, 
Where ever bound, yet thou art ever free; 
The path of Him, whose perfect law of love 
Bids spheres and atoms in just order move.

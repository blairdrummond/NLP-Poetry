title : Burial Rites

text : 
Everyone comes back here to die 
as I will soon. The place feels right 
since it’s half dead to begin with. 
Even on a rare morning of rain, 
like this morning, with the low sky 
hoarding its riches except for 
a few mock tears, the hard ground 
accepts nothing. Six years ago 
I buried my mother’s ashes 
beside a young lilac that’s now 
taller than I, and stuck the stub 
of a rosebush into her dirt, 
where like everything else not 
human it thrives. The small blossoms 
never unfurl; whatever they know 
they keep to themselves until 
a morning rain or a night wind 
pares the petals down to nothing. 
Even the neighbor cat who shits 
daily on the paths and then hides 
deep in the jungle of the weeds 
refuses to purr. Whatever’s here 
is just here, and nowhere else, 
so it’s right to end up beside 
the woman who bore me, to shovel 
into the dirt whatever’s left 
and leave only a name for some- 
one who wants it. Think of it, 
my name, no longer a portion 
of me, no longer inflated 
or bruised, no longer stewing 
in a rich compost of memory 
or the simpler one of bone shards, 
dirt, kitty litter, wood ashes, 
the roots of the eucalyptus 
I planted in ’73, 
a tiny me taking nothing, 
giving nothing, and free at last.

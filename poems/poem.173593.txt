Rhymed Stanza

"Percussus sum sicut foenum, et aruit cor meum." ?Ps. ci.
            Wintertime nighs;
But my bereavement-pain
It cannot bring again:
            Twice no one dies.

            Flower-petals flee;
But, since it once hath been,
No more that severing scene
            Can harrow me.

            Birds faint in dread:
I shall not lose old strength
In the lone frost's black length:
            Strength long since fled!

            Leaves freeze to dun;
But friends can not turn cold
This season as of old
            For him with none.

            Tempests may scath;
But love can not make smart
Again this year his heart
            Who no heart hath.

            Black is night's cope;
But death will not appal
One who, past doubtings all,
            Waits in unhope.

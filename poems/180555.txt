title : Devotion: The Garment District

text : 
In bed as the machinery of morning begins, indistinguishable 
the subterranean turbines of the A train from the jet engine 
as it gins the clouds, rips and reseams the length of dungaree 
on its way to Pittsburgh (with the terrible and subtle cargoes, 
with ashes and a cat under the seat) from the pulleys 
of the service elevators from the baffled sound across the alley 
of the hand-iron press and the sewing machine motors whirring 
bobbins that stitch together the hot properties of Seoul   
      and the suburbs 
and the idiot village of Chelm, needle the veronica   
      and the Buddha robe 
and the sateen for spring. I looked over at her. Her skin a warp 
of Christ and a weft of meat. All night she had hauled me 
and the boy and the smoky, feckless men I was across 
the fens and stretches of mesquite through the tunnels 
and delivered me to my misery and the laborious knots of the sheets 
I wound myself in. And she was exhausted from Eros and swollen 
from anger. She could stand to put on a few pounds. I could see it 
in her ribs. Before I would marry my restlessness to her terror, 
before the crushes and wages could be made into our equity, before 
the endlessness would end in spinning jennies and sleaze   
      and the noise 
of a fleet of vehicles with tinted windows testing   
      the evacuation routes, 
I would cut, then peel, then dice, then caramelize some onions 
before she wasted away to nothing.

title : Summer Evening

author : Eamon Grennan

text : 
A spear of zinc light wounds stone and water, 
stripping the scarlet fuchsia bells and yellow buttercups 

of any discretion, so they confess their end in this   
luminous declaration that they are no more than 

shortlived absolutes in living colour, bright eyes   
open against the dark. A light in which everything 

is exact-edged, flat, no bulk or heft to it, yet   
decisively itself in outline: islands, the matte grey sea, 

and miles away the fine glowing line of the horizon   
that like desire will be the last to go. The mountain's 

immense green and brown triangle reflects on itself   
in lakewater, doubling its shape and colour there, 

its stillness something drastic, an aspect of dread—as if   
a lover tried to remember that loved other body 

by looking in the mirror. Almost at random, shadows   
fall across the small roads—which can never follow 

their own bent, but always take the grain of the hill,   
turning to its every tilt and inclination—and evening 

starts to seep into hedges and hung washing: it is   
the brown colour of a bat's wing, and silent 

as a bat is. Even your own family now would have to 
be streaked with it, their faces by degrees bleeding away 

in the gather-dark, whole patches of them blackening   
like zones of a map thrown on smouldering embers.

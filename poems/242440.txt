title : Supplication

author : John Wieners

text : 
O poetry, visit this house often,
 imbue my life with success,
 leave me not alone,
 give me a wife and home.
  
 Take this curse off
 of early death and drugs,
 make me a friend among peers,
 lend me love, and timeliness.
  
 Return me to the men who teach
 and above all, cure the 
 hurts of wanting the impossible
 through this suspended vacuum.
  
1969

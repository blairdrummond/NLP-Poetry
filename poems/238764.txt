title : The Leopard

author : Lorenzo Thomas

text : 
The eyeballs on her behind are like fire
Leaping and annoying
The space they just passed
Just like fire would do

The ground have no mouth to complain
And the girl is not braver herself

She is beautiful in her spotted
Leopard ensemble. Heartless so

To keep her fashionalbe in New York
Leopards are dying

Crude comments flutter around her
At lunchtime. She sure look good
She remembers nine banishing speeches

More powerful than this is the seam
Of the leotard under her clothing

Her tail in the leotard is never still
The seam!
She feels it too familiar on her leg
As some crumb says something suggestive 

The leopard embracing around her
Is too chic to leap and strike

Her thoughts fall back to last semesterâ€™s karate

Underneath, the leotard crouches up on her thigh
It is waiting for its terrible moment!

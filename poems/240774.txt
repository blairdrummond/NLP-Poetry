title : Vivaldi

author : Stuart Dybek

text : 
When I met Vivaldi it was dark,
 a ragman lashed his horse’s bells,
 streets tilted into slow wind tunnels,
  
 no, it was another night, in winter,
 snow as soft as opium, two winoes wassailed
 down an alley through a milk truck’s ruts,
  
 in the subways a violin was whistling
 down chrome tracks, past cobalt semaphores,
 rats and pennies underneath the 3rd rail . . .
  
 Has it never been so quiet that you’ve heard
 the manhole covers rumble when the El goes overhead?
 Icicles growing? Could you tell the difference
 between the sound of filaments in light bulbs
 burning down, and a dulcimer played in a padded cell?
  
 A meager music hovers everywhere: 
 at mouths of drains, echoing stairwells
 where girls in muslin disappear
 whispering “allegro.”
  
 When I closed my eyes,
 less than a ghost,
 Vivaldi cupped a mouth harp
 like a match against the wind.

text : 
To be shy,   
to lower your eyes   
after making a greeting.   

to know    
wherever you go   
you’ll be called on,   

to fear   
whoever you’re near   
will ask you,   

to wear   
the softer sides of the air   
in rooms filled with angers,   

your ship    
always docked    
in transparent slips    

whose wharves    
are sheerer than membranes.

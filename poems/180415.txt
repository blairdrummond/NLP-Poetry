title : I Am the President of Regulation

author : Jerome Rothenberg

text : 
I am the Giant Goliath, 
I digest goat cheese. 
I am a mammoth's calf.                                  (H. Ball) 
I know your pinnacles by name. 
My fingers close around 
your fingers. I grow pale. 
I become your executioner. 
I come forth fat & bloody. 
I propose a toast to peace. 
I am the president of regulation. 
None are savvier than I. 
I forge a pact with murderers. 
I claw my way to freedom. 
Mark my words. I have no time 
to be your humble servant. 
I make a rope from women's hair. 
I bite into the mighty pippin. 
I turn & then return by turning. 
I turn a vessel over with my hands. 
I turn a pretty penny. 
I am called the lord of dimes. 
I turn my thoughts to daily deeds. 
I turn my eyes to heaven. 
I turn a screw no one has turned 
before me. I predicate 
& postposition freely. 
In me the numbers come to naught. 
I find a secret world in mirrors. 
My fingernails are pale, 
my steps are perpendicular. 
I parachute & strut. 
I seek acceleration day by day. 
I am a man who swims among the drifters. 
Istanbul is not my home. 
I turn a page & listen. 
I am as hard as nails. 
My body swells from all the sounds inside it. 
I show myself in dreams.

title : Be Someone

author : Rita Ann Higgins

text : 
For Christ’s sake,
 learn to type
 and have something
 to fall back on.
  
 Be someone,
 make something of yourself,
 look at Gertrudo Ganley.
  
 Always draw the curtains
 when the lights are on.
  
 Have nothing to do
 with the Shantalla gang,
 get yourself a right man
 with a Humber Sceptre.
  
 For Christ’s sake
 wash your neck
 before going into God’s house.
  
 Learn to speak properly,
 always pronounce your ings.
 Never smoke on the street,
 don’t be caught dead
 in them shameful tight slacks,
  
 spare the butter,
 economise,
  
 and for Christ’s sake
 at all times,
 watch your language.

It sifts from Leaden Sieves -
It powders all the Wood. 
It fills with Alabaster Wool 
The Wrinkles of the Road -

It makes an even Face 
Of Mountain, and of Plain -
Unbroken Forehead from the East 
Unto the East again -

It reaches to the Fence -
It wraps it Rail by Rail 
Till it is lost in Fleeces -
It deals Celestial Vail 

To Stump, and Stack - and Stem -
A Summer’s empty Room - 
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were, 
Recordless, but for them -

It Ruffles Wrists of Posts 
As Ankles of a Queen -
Then stills it’s Artisans - like Ghosts - 
Denying they have been -

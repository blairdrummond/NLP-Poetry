title : poem in praise of menstruation

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
if there is a river
 more beautiful than this
 bright as the blood
 red edge of the moon          if
  
 there is a river
 more faithful than this
 returning each month
 to the same delta          if there
  
 is a river
 braver than this
 coming and coming in a surge
 of passion, of pain          if there is
  
 a river 
 more ancient than this
 daughter of eve
 mother of cain and of abel          if there is in
  
 the universe such a river          if
 there is some where water
 more powerful than this wild
 water
 pray that it flows also
 through animals
 beautiful and faithful and ancient
 and female and brave

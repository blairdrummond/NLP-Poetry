A Bird, came down the Walk - 
 He did not know I saw -
 He bit an Angle Worm in halves 
 And ate the fellow, raw, 
  
 And then, he drank a Dew
 From a convenient Grass -
 And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
 To let a Beetle pass -
  
 He glanced with rapid eyes,
 That hurried all abroad -
 They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,
 He stirred his Velvet Head. - 
  
 Like one in danger, Cautious,
 I offered him a Crumb,
 And he unrolled his feathers, 
 And rowed him softer Home -
  
 Than Oars divide the Ocean,
 Too silver for a seam,
 Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, 
 Leap, plashless as they swim.

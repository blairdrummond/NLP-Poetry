title : The Pomegranate and the Big Crowd

author : Alberto Ríos

text : 
Ventura because she was hungry and because 
She was curious—but more because she was curious— 
Took the dare, a kiss for a pomegranate. 
Everyone gathered, her friends and his. Everyone 
Watched: the boys, the girls, the pigs and the chickens, 
And more. Moving to the front were the children 
She and Clemente would one day have, 
And the children of those children, too, 
Gathered and loud with everyone and everything else, 
Loud as the pigs and fast as the chickens 
Though she could not see them. 
Still, they crowded her, and she could feel 
Their anxious breathing. 
This boy Clemente whom she would kiss 
She would have kissed even without the pomegranate, 
Though she could not say it 
And was glad of this game. He suited her, 
She thought. He had a strong face. 
He felt what she felt. She could see him look around 
But not at their friends. She could see him 
Feel the shiver of the children they would have: 
Their son Margarito, his two sisters 
Both of whom would become nuns 
If just to pray enough to take care of him, 
This boy so serious he would seem like a stranger 
In their arms, serious enough by himself 
To make up for Clemente and Ventura 
And for all the laughter 
They themselves would feel, 
This curious child who, as an old man 
Would never trust a doctor for anything. 
And his serious wife to come, Refugio, 
And her sisters, Matilde and Consuelo as well, 
All the people who would follow this kiss, 
So many of them, and their children, too, 
Everyone stood there, arms up, everyone watching, 
So much noise in this moment, 
This quick lending of herself 
To his cheek, the way Ventura would later kiss 
All these impatient children of theirs. The kiss 
Seemed so small, but was filled with itself. 
This small moment of affection she gave this boy 
The quarter-second that it took: 
There they all stood, waiting with the crowd 
Egging them on, hefting the pomegranate 
And pushing them toward each other. 
Clemente and Ventura in that quarter-second lived 
Their lives, a quarter-second not finished yet.

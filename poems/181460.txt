title : Holy Shit

It used to be more private—just the 
immediate family gathered after mass, 
the baptismal font at the rear 
of the church tiny as a bird bath. 
The priest would ladle a few teaspoons’ 
tepid holy water on the bundled baby’s 
forehead, make a crack about the halo 
being too tight as the new soul wailed. 
We’d go home to pancakes and eggs. 

These days it’s a big Holy-wood production— 
midmass, the giant altar rolls back to reveal 
a Jacuzzi tub surrounded by potted palms. 
The priest hikes up his chasuble, steps 
barefoot out of his black leather loafers 
and wades in like a newfangled John as 
organ music swells and the baby-bearing families 
line up like jumbo jets ready for takeoff. 

But when the godparents handed my niece’s newborn 
naked to their parish priest, and he dunked her 
into the Jacuzzi’s bath-warm holy water, 
her little one grew so calm and blissful she 
pooped—not a smelly three-days’ worth, explosive 
diaper load, but enough to notice. As the godparents 
scooped the turds with a handkerchief, 
the savvy priest pretended he hadn’t seen, 
swept through the fouled water with his palm 
before the next baby in line was submerged. 

After mass, my niece sat speechless, 
red-faced, not knowing what to say— 
or whether—as church ladies, friends, and 
family members presented one by one to 
the tub where the babies had been 
baptized. As they knelt and bowed 
and dipped their fingers in, 
and blessed themselves.

title : Love Story

author : James Doyle

text : 
The kitchen door opens onto dirt 
and the second half of the country 
all the way to the Pacific. Rusted 
prairie trains out of the tall weeds 
elbow the last century aside, rumble 
from every direction towards Chicago.

My great-grandfather, who would be 
150 years old today, put on his one 
tall hat and took the big trip 
to Omaha for my great-grandma 
with the family ring on his vest
and winter wheat lying wait in seed.

He gave her all the miles he had 
and she gave him the future I walk 
around in every day. The mountains 
were too far west to count so they 
doubled back over the land and century 
and the real weather kept coming from them.

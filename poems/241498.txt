 It wasn’﻿t over a woman that war began, but it’﻿s better
 To see it this way, my myth professor loved to say, a man
 From the South rumored to extort the bodies of college girls
 Into higher grades. My girlfriend of the time told me so —
  
 He was a creep, she
 Got an A in the class and liked his joke about religion
 As self-mutilation, it was Ramadan then and, O Helen,
 I was fasting. I lie awake in a desert night east
  
 Of the Atlantic on the verge of rain, the catapulted grains
 Of sand on hot zinc roof, the rustle of leaves, the flap
 Of peeling bark on trees whose names I do not know, and where
 Would I find a botany guide here. Water flowed
  
 Like a river from the Jabal once.
 There were elephant pools, alligator
 Streams, and a pond for the devil to speak in human tongues.
 All desiccant names now after an earthquake
  
 Shuffled the ground decades ago. It will rain soon,
 I’﻿m assured, since nothing has stopped
 The birds from migration. All the look-alikes
 Are already here: the stork, the heron.
  
 The white flying flowers, the ibis, and the one
 That aesthetizes you more.

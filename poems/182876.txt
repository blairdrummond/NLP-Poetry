title : [Old Mother turns blue and from us]

author : Lorine Niedecker

text : 
Old Mother turns blue and from us, 
   “Don’t let my head drop to the earth. 
I’m blind and deaf.” Death from the heart, 
   a thimble in her purse.   

“It’s a long day since last night. 
   Give me space. I need 
floors. Wash the floors, Lorine!— 
   wash clothes! Weed!”

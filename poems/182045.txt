(Detroit, 1950)
Because the jobs were there 
and a man could get rich 
working on the line, the South 
retreated North to Michigan, 
whole families eating crackers and baloney 
by the side of the road, 
changing drivers to keep 
moving through corn fields 
and foreign towns, 
sundown and darkness, 
the moon a prophecy of chrome, 
the stars 10 million headlights 
of the cars they would build. 

Ahead lay a city bright with steel; 
behind, the dark fields folded 
over everything they knew; 
and when they dozed 
on cramped back seats, they dreamed 
such dreams as the road can make, 
of drifting on a lake or stream 
or lying down in hay to dream of traveling, 
so that when they woke to a bump, 
a couch, a voice saying, “It’s your turn,” 
they were lost to themselves 
and took a few moments 
to remember their names. 

Mostly behind their backs, 
the locals called them 
rednecks, crackers, goddamned rebs. 
Strange to be strange, 
in their new neighborhoods, 
to be ethnic with a thick accent 
and a taste for food the grocers didn’t stock— 
hog jowl and blackeyes, turnip greens, 
roasting ears, souse-meat— 
the butcher shrugging, 
the produce man shaking his head. 
Sometimes their own voices 
took them by surprise, 
sounding odd and out of place 
in the din of a city bus, ringing 
lost in the evening air when 
they called their children in for supper. 

At work they touched 
parts of tomorrow, 
next year’s models always 
taking shape and vanishing, 
the present obsolete, the past 
merely a rumor, 
all hours blurring 
into one continuous moment 
of finishing a fragment, 
each piece the same piece, 
movements identical, 
endless, like a punishment in hell. 

No way out but back 
to their old lives, a future 
they already knew by heart, 
a few on the road each month 
in cars they may have helped assemble, 
tokens of their failed success, 
legacies for boys to find 
years later rusting on some lot, 
banged up but still a dream 
and fast enough when overhauled 
to make them feel they could blast 
straight into tomorrow, 
as they raced their engines at each stoplight 
and cruised their towns in circles.

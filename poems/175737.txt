Driving west through sandstone’s 
red arenas, a rodeo of slow erosion 
cleaves these plains, these ravaged cliffs. 
This is cowboy country. Desolate. Dull. Except 
on weekends, when cafés bloom like cactus 
after drought. My rented Mustang bucks 
the wind—I’m strapped up, wide-eyed, 
busting speed with both heels, a sure grip 
on the wheel. Black clouds maneuver 
in the distance, but I don’t care. Mileage 
is my obsession. I’m always racing off, 
passing through, as though the present 
were a dying town I’d rather flee. 
What matters is the future, its glittering 
Hotel. Clouds loom closer, big as Brahmas 
in the heavy air. The radio crackles 
like a shattered rib. I’m in the chute. 
I check the gas and set my jaw. I’m almost there.

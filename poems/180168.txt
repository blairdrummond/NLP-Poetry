title : Tonight

author : Elfriede Jelinek

text : 
tonight 
my sparrows 
let go 
the snow 
                                    into fields of carnations swollen with anger. 

tonight 
the three popes 
proclaim 
the revolution 
                                    against teenage television. 

seals smash 
their heads 
bloody 
their heads 
on the elevators 
the paternoster elevators 
                                    which delays the holding of their conference. 

tonight 
my sister 
the wind's bride 
gives blood 
for the cello 
of the jericho desert 
                                    which prompts the trombones                                       
                                    to hold a protest meeting. 

tonight   
I hang your lips 
like birdseed 
outside my door 
and observe 
through the window 
their death-struggle 
with the she vulture. 

tonight 
let go 
the snow

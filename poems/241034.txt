title : As the Dead Prey Upon Us

author : Charles Olson

text : 
As the dead prey upon us,
 they are the dead in ourselves,
 awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
 disentangle the nets of being!
  
 I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
 I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
 But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
 were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
  
 as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
 about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
 beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
 playing on the victrola, and all of them
 desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
  
 I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
 there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
 poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
 of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
 displays, the dead roaming from one to another
 as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
 to mere equipments
  
                                my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
 when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
 under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
  
 I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
 the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
 as other like suited and dressed people did in life
  
 O the dead!
  
                     and the Indian woman and I
                     enabled the blue deer
                     to walk
  
                     and the blue deer talked,
                     in the next room,
                     a Negro talk
  
                     it was like walking a jackass,
                     and its talk
                     was the pressing gabber of gammers
                     of old women
  
                     and we helped walk it around the room
                     because it was seeking socks
                     or shoes for its hooves
                     now that it was acquiring
  
                     human possibilities
  
 In the five hindrances men and angels
 stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
 which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
 which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
 and the demons
 and men
 go up and down
  
                                  Walk the jackass
                                  Hear the victrola
                                  Let the automobile
                                  be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                  when it is a white chair. Purity
  
 is only an instant of being, the trammels

recur
  
 In the five hindrances, perfection
 is hidden
                                  I shall get
                                  to the place
                                  10 minutes late.
  
                                  It will be 20 minutes
                                  of 9. And I don’t know,
  
                                  without the car,
  
                                  how I shall get there
  
 O peace, my mother, I do not know
 how differently I could have done
 what I did or did not do.

                                  That you are back each week
                                  that you fall asleep
                                  with your face to the right
  
                                  that you are present there
                                  when I come in as you were
                                  when you were alive
  
                                  that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                  is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                  I am used to your having
  
                                  but o, that you all find it
                                  such a cheapness!
  
 o peace, mother, for the mammothness
 of the comings and goings
 of the ladders of life
  
 The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
 my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
 of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
 be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
 go. Let there be only paradise
  
 The desperateness is, that the instant
 which is also paradise (paradise
 is happiness) dissolves
 into the next instant, and power
 flows to meet the next occurrence
  
                                  Is it any wonder
                                  my mother comes back?
                                  Do not that throng
                                  rightly seek the room
                                  where they might expect
                                  happiness? They did not complain
                                  of life, they obviously wanted
                                  the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                  among each other there,
                              where the real is, even to the display cards,
                              to be out of hell
  
                              The poverty
                              of hell

 O souls, in life and in death,
 make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
 know what wind
 even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
 lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
 equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
 the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
 the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
 lifts the sodden nets 
  
                                  and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                  as spider webs, nothing
                                  before the hand of man
  
                                  The vent! You must have the vent,
                                  or you shall die. Which means
                                  never to die, the ghastliness
  
                                  of going, and forever
                                  coming back, returning
                                  to the instants which were not lived
  
                                  O mother, this I could not have done,
                                  I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                  I am myself netted in my own being
  
                                  I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                  perfect
  
                                  O my soul, slip
                                  the cog
  
  
 II
  
 The death in life (death itself)
 is endless, eternity
 is the false cause
  
 The knot is other wise, each topological corner
 presents itself, and no sword
 cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
  
 each knot of which the net is made
 is for the hands to untake
 the knot’s making. And touch alone
 can turn the knot into its own flame
  
                           (o mother, if you had once touched me
  
                           o mother, if I had once touched you)
  
 The car did not burn. Its underside
 was not presented to me
 a grotesque corpse. The old man
  
 merely removed it as I looked up at it,
 and put it in a corner of the picket fence
 like was it my mother’s white dog?
  
 or a child’s chair
  
                                  The woman,
                                  playing on the grass,
                                  with her son (the woman next door)
  
                                  was angry with me whatever it was
                                  slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                  she had out there on the grass
  
                                  And I was quite flip in reply
                                  that anyone who used plastic
                                  had to expect things to skid
  
                                  and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                  that her son might have been hurt
                                  by whatever it was I sent skidding
  
                                  down on them.
  
                                  It was just then I went into my house
                                  and to my utter astonishment
                                  found my mother sitting there 
  
                                  as she always had sat, as must she always
                                  forever sit there her head lolling
                                  into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
  
                                  what wind will lift you too
                                  forever from the tawdriness,
                                  make you rich as all those souls
  
                                  crave crave crave
  
                                  to be rich?
  
 They are right. We must have
 what we want. We cannot afford
 not to. We have only one course:
  
 the nets which entangle us are flames
  
                                          O souls, burn
                                          alive, burn now
  
                                          that you may forever
                                          have peace, have
  
                                          what you crave
  
                                          O souls,
                                          go into everything,
                                          let not one knot pass
                                          through your fingers
  
                                          let not any they tell you
                                          you must sleep as the net
                                          comes through your authentic hands
  
                                          What passes
                                          is what is, what shall be, what has
                                          been, what hell and heaven is
                                          is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                          through the screen of flame which each knot
                                          hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                          to be shot open by you
  
                                                                                the nets of being
                                          are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                          ought to be busy. Method, method
  
                                          I too call on you to come
                                          to the aid of all men, to women most
                                          who know most, to woman to tell
                                          men to awake. Awake, men,
                                          awake
  
 I ask my mother
 to sleep. I ask her
 to stay in the chair.
 My chair
 is in the corner of the fence.
 She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
 need not trouble either of us.
  
 And if she sits in happiness the souls
 who trouble her and me
 will also rest. The automobile
  
 has been hauled away.

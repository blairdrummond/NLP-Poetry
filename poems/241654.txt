title : Chat Room

author : Paul Foster Johnson

text : 
P. entered a third space
 from which he could watch time pass
 instead of walking to the monastery
 in the middle of the night.
  
 His opaque sexuality derived from the absence
 of a guarantee that his person would remain intact.
  
 He recognized this in himself
 and we stared at the pylons regressing
 into the lackluster northeastern woods.
  
 The monastery was a display
 before which he claimed sangfroid
 a picturesque ruin to which he was conveyed
 as though by boreal fluid.
  
 Everyone loved occasional works like this
 their allusions to complementary and absent events.
  
 Weaving around proliferating drywall
 I despaired over this desire.
  
 P. joined the migrant workforce
 and grew more disconsolate and distant
 and drunk in our presence.
  
 Our presence was only possible
 because of advances in technology
 in a dialectical relationship with their debasement:
 servers in cold rooms
 and a recursive void of woodblock chat sounds.

1. Josef Mengele Drowns While Swimming at a Beach in Brazil, 1979
  
 His name then: Wolfgang Gerhard.
 How easy, slipping on another man’s
         skin. Another country, too,
  
 its sun’s heat and light
 as insistent as a pair 
 of forceps.
  
 His pants, left crumpled
 on the beach, forged papers
 and a few hard candies in the pocket.
  
 Where the water 
         was shallow, he could look
         down and see
  
 his shadow passing over
 the pale sand, a wobbly twin,
  
         matching him
 stroke for stroke for stroke.
  
  
 2. Li Po Drowns Trying to Embrace the Reflection of the Moon in the Yangtze, 762
  
 The moon is no drinker of wine, so I must
 compensate. Surely you’ve heard
  
 the crows and nightingales
 egging me on? The day has dispersed
 from the courtyards like a gang 
         of sparrows, and nothing
  
 is left of the world that is not 
 pecked-over, hard and dark
         as the dream of an apple seed.
  
 The young men laugh
 at an old man drinking
 alone, but here
  
 are my companions:
         my shadow, as loyal
         and thin as a starved dog,
  
 and the moon, his whole face
         wrinkling with laughter.
  
  
 3. Bob, the Circus Seal, Drowns Himself in His Tank in Galveston, 1911
  
 By then his teeth had rotted out,
         and he often turned to his owner
 with his mouth open as if about
  
 to speak, a ruined smell
 jetting from inside.
  
 He had already attempted it,
  
         three days before,
 but his owner dove in and pulled him up
 onto the slimy planks. His circus show days
  
 were long gone. Sure, some afternoons
 a kid might walk by
         and see the scabby painting
  
 on the side of the building: the hoop,
 the pedestal, the ghost
 of a man in a top hat,
  
 the striped ball now like a clot
 of pus streaked
 with blood, hovering
  
 over the sleek, dark head.
  
  
 4. Natalie Wood Drowns under Mysterious Circumstances near Santa Catalina Island, 1981
  
 Let me tell you: death
         is a long silk glove
 dropped to the floor.
  
 It doesn’t remember the heft
 of the arm, the fingers
         dancing.
  
 That limb is gone, and nothing
 will hold its shape again.
  
 You twirl your pastel skirt. You watch
 two cars 
 race toward the cliff,
         and there is nothing
  
 you can do. So many lives
         you’ve entered
 like a room: swooned,
  
 held the prop pistol
 to your own face, sang
 for the back row.
         But was it your voice?
  
 What was that name
 you were born into?
         Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko?
 What happened to her?
  
         Was she the one
 taken, her family butchered, living 
 another life
 among the enemy people?
  
 Was it the morning?
 when she stopped scanning
 the horizon for rescuers
         that she turned into you?
  
  
 5. Hippasus of Metapontum Is Drowned at Sea for the Heresy of Discovering Irrational Numbers, ca. 500 BCE
  
 His fellow Pythagoreans had already built
 a shrine to his memory
         and placed it where 
  
 he passed by every day, but he did not take
         the hint. It was on the ship
 that they seized him.
  
 God was an integer, firm
 as an unripe apricot.
         But weren’t there streets
         in the city that wound forever
 into the minute darkness?
  
 Weren’t there dreams where he met
 himself again and again,
 without ever seeming to wake?
  
 The sea is incommensurable.
         Each lungful of air
         kept dividing itself, even as the boat
  
 became a decimal point on the far horizon.
  
  
 6. Bennie Wint, 20 Years after Faking His Drowning Death, is Discovered Alive, 2009
  
 In the first years after I disappeared, I read
 every report of drowning: children,
  
 mostly boys,
 mostly in their bathtubs,
 mostly accidents.
  
 Old men whose lungs filled with fluid
         while they sat in their armchairs.
  
 Fishermen. Swimmers. Immigrants
 crowded onto rafts. Some men, 
         their throats seize up,
         and they die without
  
 ever swallowing a drop,
 as if they never left the shore.
  
         Some nights I dreamed
 what never happened: I held my drowning
  
 in my palm like a giant pearl.
 Some days, standing behind
 the cash register of my new life,
  
 I felt my lungs flatten out like a pair
 of discarded socks. Did I ever think
  
 of the woman I left on the shore
         as I kicked out
 past the last of the breakers?
  
 I won’t say.
 Here it was: I might have drowned
 trying to pretend to. I had to swim
 so far out, then mark
  
 a different beach
 and swim back
  
 a different man, without knowing
 if his strength was enough
         to carry me to shore.

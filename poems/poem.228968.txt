Rhymed Stanza

All my past life is mine no more,
         The flying hours are gone,
Like transitory dreams giv'n o'er,
Whose images are kept in store
         By memory alone.

The time that is to come is not;
         How can it then be mine?
The present moment's all my lot;
And that, as fast as it is got,
         Phyllis, is only thine.

Then talk not of inconstancy,
         False hearts, and broken vows;
If I, by miracle, can be
This live-long minute true to thee,
         'Tis all that Heav'n allows.

title : Twelve Twelve Twelve

a.) When I was twelve, I lived
 on the grounds of a mental asylum.
  
  
 b). My Filipino mother was a psychiatrist,
 so that meant we lived
 in the doctor’s quarters—
 one of the three big brick houses
 that edged the institute.
  
  
 c). My younger sister and I practiced Herkies—
 our favorite cheerleading jumps—
 off the patients’ bleachers near the softball field.
  
  
 d). When I was twelve, I aced
 the experiments
 with celery and food coloring;
 they let me skip a whole grade
 and get right to The Dissections.
  
  
 e). I secretly wished my supply
 of grape Bubble Yum would never run out
 but I couldn’t figure out how to blow bubbles
 and snap the lavender gum like Sara could.
  
  
 f). We sold gift wrap and crystals
 for a junior high fund-raiser and my mom still asks
 Where are all the crystals I bought?
 and
 Why don’t you display them in your house?
  
 g). When I was twelve, I worried about
 the darkening hair on my legs.
 My mother bought me my first training bra—
 no cup, just little triangle pieces stitched together—
 and then a slice of New York-style cheesecake
 to bring home.
  
  
 h). Home.
  
  
 i). When I was twelve, our house
 always smelled of fried lumpia
 or ginger.
  
  
 j). We had zinnias
 as wide as my outstretched hand
 nodding at us in our garden.
  
  
 k). My school had to create
 a whole new bus stop
 just for my sister and me,
 and everyone stopped talking and stared
 when we stepped onto the bus each morning,
 smelling of grape gum and ginger roots.
  
  
 l.) Just who are these girls?

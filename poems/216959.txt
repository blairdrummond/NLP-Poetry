title : Appetite

Pale gold and crumbling with crust 
mottled dark, almost bronze, 
pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate. 
Flecked with the pale paper 
of hive, their hexagonal cells 
leak into the deepening pool 
of amber. On your lips, 
against palate, tooth and tongue, 
the viscous sugar squeezes 
from its chambers, sears sweetness 
into your throat until you chew 
pulp and wax from a blue city 
of bees. Between your teeth 
is the blown flower and the flower's 
seed. Passport pages stamped 
and turning. Death's officious hum. 
Both the candle and its anther 
of flame. Your own yellow hunger. 
Never say you can't take 
this world into your mouth.

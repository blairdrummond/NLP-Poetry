title : Starlings

author : W. S. Di Piero

text : 
Snarls, bread trucks, yeast   
breathing inside huddled bags,   
and sleepers completing lives   
behind their gray windows. 

A whistle on the phonewires,   
feathers, twitches, whistling   
down to the hot loaves. 

Reeds everywhere, pulse, 
flesh, flutes, and wakened sighs.   
An answer. Radio news 

and breathers behind our windows,   
birds’ new voices changing,   
changed, to the unforgiving   
hunger screech of immigrants.

title : The New Intelligence

author : Timothy Donnelly

text : 
After knowledge extinguished the last of the beautiful
 fires our worship had failed to prolong, we walked
 back home through pedestrian daylight, to a residence
  
 humbler than the one left behind. A door without mystery,
 a room without theme. For the hour that we spend
 complacent at the window overlooking the garden,
  
 we observe an arrangement in rust and gray-green,
 a vagueness at the center whose slow, persistent
 movements some sentence might explain if we had time
  
 or strength for sentences. To admit that what falls
 falls solitarily, lost in the permanent dusk of the particular.
 That the mind that fear and disenchantment fatten
  
 comes to boss the world around it, morbid as the damp-
 fingered guest who rearranges the cheeses the minute the host
 turns to fix her a cocktail. A disease of the will, the way
  
 false birch branches arch and interlace from which
 hands dangle last leaf-parchments and a very large array
 of primitive bird-shapes. Their pasted feathers shake
  
 in the aftermath of the nothing we will ever be content
 to leave the way we found it. I love that about you.
 I love that when I call you on the long drab days practicality
  
 keeps one of us away from the other that I am calling
 a person so beautiful to me that she has seen my awkwardness
 on the actual sidewalk but she still answers anyway.
  
 I say that when I fell you fell beside me and the concrete
 refused to apologize. That a sparrow sat for a spell
 on the windowsill today to communicate the new intelligence.
  
 That the goal of objectivity depends upon one’s faith
 in the accuracy of one’s perceptions, which is to say
 a confidence in the purity of the perceiving instrument.
  
 I won’t be dying after all, not now, but will go on living dizzily
 hereafter in reality, half-deaf to reality, in the room
 perfumed by the fire that our inextinguishable will begins.

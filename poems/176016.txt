All things fall away: store fronts on the west, 
ANGEL’S DELICATESSEN, windows boarded 
and laced in day-glow, BLUE KNIGHT AUTO REPAIR   
to the north with its verandah of rusted mufflers 

and hubcaps of extinct Studebakers. 
The diminishing neighborhood sprawls   
under dusty folds of sycamore and fading elm,   
the high birdhouse out back starling-haunted. 

Inside the cottage a bay window translates   
the language of sunlight, flaring like baroque   
trumpets on the red carpet, shadow-dappled   
as the house turns slowly beneath the drift 

of tree branch and sun. We have come 
to shroud the couch in plastic, spread sheets   
over the fat reading chair and the piano’s   
mahogany gloom, the impossible etude’s 

blur of black notes. Among a turmoil 
of ungraded papers lies the Loeb Classics Aeneid 
open to the last lesson. Later in the bedroom   
we imagine a flourish of light, her husband 

loosening the sash of her white silk robe,   
his beard brushing the back of her neck.   
Amores, the art of love, of words lifting   
like vapors on a cold day, the dense vowels 

of Ovid and Virgil almost vanished, almost   
risen to music. We lock the heavy door   
and walk away from the silence, the lone   
hexameters of Dido pulsing in an empty house.

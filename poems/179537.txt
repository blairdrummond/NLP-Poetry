title : Catching the Moles

author : Judith Kitchen

text : 
First we tamp down the ridges 
that criss-cross the yard 

then wait for the ground 
to move again. 

I hold the shoe box, 
you, the trowel. 

When I give you the signal 
you dig in behind 

and flip forward. 
Out he pops into daylight, 

blind velvet. 

We nudge him into the box, 
carry him down the hill. 

Four times we’ve done it. 
The children worry. 

Have we let them all go 
at the very same spot? 

Will they find each other? 
We can’t be sure ourselves, 

only just beginning to learn 
the fragile rules of uprooting.

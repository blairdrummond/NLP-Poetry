title : A Kind of Headless Guilt Emerges

author : Ana Božičević

text : 
I’m alone until I’m asleep, and there you are: naked,
 you take my hand: Shhhh! We
  
 tiptoe through a 
 black-blue meadow. To the pond behind the farmhouse. (The farmer
  
 sleeps in the blind window.) No cicadas even,
 maybe just maybe Venus — & this is before Wednesday, everything’s 
                  alright, we
  
 tiptoe ‘round the house as around a painful subject — & we’re at the pond!
 And now it’s time. To use vague holy-man speech, like: I am
  
 another face in your hand, the face of your eye — wing-surrogates, the word
 bones —
  
 it’s time for afternoon, them white-blank architectures.
 No, veil. Nothing’s glistening. Christmas, Christmas. It’s time
  
 for you to forgive me: I was forced to eat valises
 that wouldn’t close by themselves —
  
 that was just a dream, good morning:
  
 regurgitate the stars and the soot

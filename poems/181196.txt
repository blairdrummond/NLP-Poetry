title : Dropping the euphemism

He has five children, I’m papa 
to a hundred pencils. 
I bought the chair he sat in 

from a book of chairs, 
staplers and spikes 
that let me play Vlad the Impaler 

with invading memos. When I said 
I have to lay you off 
a parallel universe was born 

in his face, one where flesh 
is a loose shirt 
taken to the river and beaten 

against rocks. Just 
by opening my mouth I destroyed 
his faith he’s a man 

who can think honey-glazed ham 
and act out the thought 
with plastic or bills. We sat. 

I stared at my hands, he stared 
at the wall staring at my hands. 
I said other things 

about the excellent work he’d done 
and the cycles of business 
which are like 

the roller-coaster thoughts 
of an oscilloscope. All this time 
I saw the eyes of his wife 

which had always been brown 
like almonds but were now brown 
like the crust of bread. We walked 

to the door, I shook his hand, 
felt the bones pretending 
to be strong. On his way home 

there was a happy song 
because de Sade invented radio, 
the window was open, he saw 

delphinium but couldn’t remember 
the name. I can only guess. 
Maybe at each exit 

that could have led his body 
to Tempe, to Mars, he was tempted 
to forget his basketball team 

of sons, or that he ever liked 
helping his wife clean carrots, 
the silver sink turning orange. 

Running’s natural to most animals 
who aren’t part 
of a lecture series on Nature’s 

Dead Ends. When I told him, 
I saw he was looking for a place 
in his brain to hide 

his brain. I tried that later 
with beer, it worked until I stood 
at the toilet to make my little 

waterfall, and thought of him 
pushing back from a bar 
to go make the same noise.

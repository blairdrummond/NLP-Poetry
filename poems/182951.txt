title : There She Is

author : Linda Gregg

text : 
When I go into the garden, there she is. 
The specter holds up her arms to show 
that her hands are eaten off. 
She is silent because of the agony. 
There is blood on her face. 
I can see she has done this to herself. 
So she would not feel the other pain. 
And it is true, she does not feel it. 
She does not even see me. 
It is not she anymore, but the pain itself 
that moves her. I look and think 
how to forget. How can I live while she 
stands there? And if I take her life 
what will that make of me? I cannot 
touch her, make her conscious. 
It would hurt her too much. 
I hear the sound all through the air 
that was her eating, but it is on its own now, 
completely separate from her. I think 
I am supposed to look. I am not supposed 
to turn away. I am supposed to see each detail 
and all expression gone. My God, I think, 
if paradise is to be here 
it will have to include her.

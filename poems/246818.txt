title : A Girl Ago

author : Lucie Brock-Broido

text : 
No feeding on wisteria. No pitch-burner traipsing 
In the nettled woods. No milk in metal cylinders, no 
Buttering. No making small contusions on the page 
But saying nothing no one has not said before. 
No milkweed blown across your pony-coat, no burrs. 
No scent of juniper on your Jacobean mouth. No crush 
Of ink or injury, no lacerating wish.
                                                      Extinguish me from this. 
I was sixteen for twenty years. By September I will be a ghost 
And flickering in unison with all the other fireflies in Appalachia, 
Blinking in the swarm of it, and all at once, above 
And on a bare branch in a shepherd's sky.    No Dove.
                                                       There is no thou to speak of.

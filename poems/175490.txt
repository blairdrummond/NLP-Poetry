Ysidro calls me at night, meeya carra. his big 
blonde bean, and slides his moustache across my 
neck. he’s dark, and like I imagine his country, 
flat and arid, face a painted clay pot drying 
on the windowsill, on his lip, trails a snake 
with black twisted rattles. he asks me about 
my youth, and I tell him like the others, that 
they said I would never amount to anything. be 
cause of my size mostly, that I was a big American 
girl. raw and wide I sent away from catalogues, 
for plastic barrettes shaped like musical notes, and 
Cuban heeled shoes. I was dreamy too, and once 
painted my naked body like a guitar, with metal 
frets and silver strings. he caught lizards and 
tamed them, and saw an orange blister ripped sun. 
its aurora looked liked yellow music, and his eyes 
narrow as he plucks it from my stomach. 

I had Matthew from the first marriage, when I 
was sixteen. we would huddle in a striped mattress 
that was split in the seams, and I thought of 
my husband as a cowboy, when his leather face 
creased and stretched. in college I later learned 
about kings, and ancient gods who sent their love 
in showers of coins, golden, manna from heaven. 
and I never talk about my first man, except to 
say that he laid my head open and the scar-line 
is his illegible signature. my son is more like 
an immaculate conception, like my adopted girls 
whose teeth and pupils are shaped like a stranger. 
we ride to the lake and crush bread for the birds. 
I like the geese with their masks and giraffe 
necks. sometimes they hiss and you’d swear they 
had a row of devil fangs under their poniard tongues. 
but especially the swans, I can’t help but think 
of them plucked and fleshy turning white and velvet, 
like my husband pulling his hands through my henna 
hair. 

Ysidro is a groundskeeper and gravedigger. sometimes 
we joke about dead business or a certain shift, and 
we laughed about the recipe I have included; 
Mexican Chicken Bake, we said: cremate a handful 
of skinny bones, and sprinkle lightly over the 
dinner table. but it’s peaceful work, and he rests 
by the tombs, and weeds the paupers’ wooden crosses. 
and tells them about the weather, and here in 
Oskaloosa it couldn’t be finer. I am alone most 
nights when he walks with sleeping Iowa, and my 
imagination can turn black. I think of sewing 
him a pole-bag, with cobra skin and vegetable 
powder. with fathers and half shells. so he 
can speak melodic incantations and command a blood- 
less multitude. scary corpses turn to me, their 
eye sockets contracting in the light. 
we feed the birds and cook a chicken. in a taco 
shell it’s perfect, spicy and delicious, like my 
sweet Spanish lover’s touch.

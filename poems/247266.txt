title : Winter Solstice

text : 
A cold night crosses 
our path
                  The world appears
very large, very
round now       extending 
far as the moon does
                                        It is from 
the moon this cold travels
                                        It is 
the light of the moon that causes 
this night reflecting distance in its own 
light so coldly
                                          (from one side of 
the earth to the other)
                                        It is the length of this coldness 
It is the long distance 
between two points which are 
not in a line        now
                                       not a 
straightness       (however 
straight) but a curve only, 
silver that is a rock reflecting
                                                      not metal 
but a rock accepting 
distance
                     (a scream in silence 
where between the two 
points what touches 
is a curve around the world
                                                      (the dance unmoving).

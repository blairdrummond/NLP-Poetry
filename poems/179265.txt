title : The Love Letters of Helen Pitts Douglass

author : Michael S. Harper

text : 
When I stood behind his desk chair   
and when he sat, on rare occasions,   
on the porch, “sage of Anacostia,”   
they called him, I smelled his mane   
glorious, and as a hand saddle 
the aroma of hair took me to neckline   
and below. In Egypt, long after   
Napoleon had shot off the face   
of the Sphinx, I thought of this   
man, and the cusp of his palms   
on my shoulder blades; 
as always he was carrying the mail   
of gender, his touch immaculate   
in the true blend of the cortex, 
and of the complex, risen on a pulpit,   
and after the hot air, wintry parlance,   
the syllables of my name in his ear,   
when he touched me, as he had touched   
me then. 
            I had my suspicions of English   
ladies, actresses, ghosts of the Thames,   
concubines, as we had been into this next   
century. And they had their wiles with him. 

I do not feel forbidden; the cameo ring   
he gave me, recession of his maleness   
all I need, and highlights of my dark   
profile, any children we might have   
had buried in architecture, 
and the hate of his daughter Rosetta,   
who I have spoken to over the grate. 

The sun rises and sets in our neighborhood: 
I WILL BURN THESE. But when I place my fingers 
in that mane it is to the saddle he will come.

title : Wayfaring

author : Micah Ballard

text : 
I see into them
as they see out of me
& dissolve the wattage
to avoid future legends
young pharaohs on Fillmore cracking dutches 
it is a lonely frontier by contrast
forgotten game skulking around
big hearts, small temper
thine absence overflows 
thine presence undoes
do not attempt to circle the inferno
a tremor in the throne
is a tremor in the throne

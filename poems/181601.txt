title : Odysseus Hears of the Death of Kalypso

author : Donald Revell

text : 
All their songs are of one hour 
Before dawn, when the birds begin. 
I sing another. 
In helpless midday, at the hour 
Even sparrows have no heart to shrill 
Comes news . . . Suddenly, the unimaginable 
Needs imagination and finds none. 

Violet ocean only nothing. 
Smoke of thyme and of cedar, 
Ornate birds, nothing. 
Even a god who came here, 
Hearing a sweet voice,   
Would find only old fires now, 
Brittle in the blackened trees.   

She was mast and sail. She was 
A stillness pregnant with motion, 
Adorable to me as, all my life, 
I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean 
In sinews and in sleep and cowardice. 
She forgave me. Once, she wept for me. 
Our child died then, and she is with him.

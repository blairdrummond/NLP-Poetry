Common Measure

I have read somewhere that the birds of fairyland are white as snow.--W. B. Yeats 
Where all the trees bear golden flowers,   
   And all the birds are white;   
Where fairy folk in dancing hours   
   Burn stars for candlelight; 

Where every wind and leaf can talk,   
   But no man understand 
Save one whose child-feet chanced to walk   
   Green paths of fairyland; 

I followed two swift silver wings;   
   I stalked a roving song; 
I startled shining, silent things;   
   I wandered all day long. 

But when it seemed the shadowy hours   
   Whispered of soft-foot night, 
I crept home to sweet common flowers,   
   Brown birds, and candlelight.

text : 
The edge of our bed was a wide grid 
where your fifteen-year-old daughter was hanging   
gut-sprung on police wheels 
a cablegram nailed to the wood 
next to a map of the Western Reserve 
I could not return with you to bury the body   
reconstruct your nightly cardboards 
against the seeping Transvaal cold 
I could not plant the other limpet mine 
against a wall at the railroad station 
nor carry either of your souls back from the river   
in a calabash upon my head 
so I bought you a ticket to Durban 
on my American Express 
and we lay together 
in the first light of a new season. 

Now clearing roughage from my autumn garden   
cow sorrel    overgrown rocket gone to seed   
I reach for the taste of today 
the New York Times finally mentions your country   
a half-page story 
of the first white south african killed in the “unrest” 
Not of Black children massacred at Sebokeng   
six-year-olds imprisoned for threatening the state   
not of Thabo Sibeko, first grader, in his own blood   
on his grandmother’s parlor floor 
Joyce, nine, trying to crawl to him 
shitting through her navel 
not of a three-week-old infant, nameless   
lost under the burned beds of Tembisa 
my hand comes down like a brown vise over the marigolds   
reckless through despair 
we were two Black women touching our flame   
and we left our dead behind us 
I hovered    you rose    the last ritual of healing   
“It is spring,” you whispered 
“I sold the ticket for guns and sulfa   
I leave for home tomorrow” 
and wherever I touch you 
I lick cold from my fingers 
taste rage 
like salt from the lips of a woman   
who has killed too often to forget   
and carries each death in her eyes   
your mouth a parting orchid   
“Someday you will come to my country   
and we will fight side by side?” 

Keys jingle in the door ajar    threatening   
whatever is coming belongs here 
I reach for your sweetness 
but silence explodes like a pregnant belly   
into my face 
a vomit of nevers. 

Mmanthatisi turns away from the cloth 
her daughters-in-law are dyeing 
the baby drools milk from her breast 
she hands him half-asleep to his sister 
dresses again for war   
knowing the men will follow. 
In the intricate Maseru twilights 
quick    sad    vital 
she maps the next day’s battle 
dreams of Durban    sometimes 
visions the deep wry song of beach pebbles 
running after the sea.

Rhymed Stanza

Patience, though I have not 
   The thing that I require, 
I must of force, God wot, 
   Forbear my most desire; 
For no ways can I find   
To sail against the wind. 

Patience, do what they will 
   To work me woe or spite, 
I shall content me still 
   To think both day and night, 
To think and hold my peace, 
Since there is no redress. 

Patience, withouten blame, 
   For I offended nought; 
I know they know the same, 
   Though they have changed their thought. 
Was ever thought so moved 
To hate that it hath loved? 

Patience of all my harm, 
   For fortune is my foe; 
Patience must be the charm 
   To heal me of my woe: 
Patience without offence 
Is a painful patience.

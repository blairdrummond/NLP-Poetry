title : from Odes: 15 ["Nothing"]

author : Basil Bunting

text : 
Nothing 
substance utters or time   
stills and restrains 
joins design and 

supple measure deftly 
as thought’s intricate polyphonic   
score dovetails with the tread   
sensuous things 
keep in our consciousness. 

Celebrate man’s craft 
and the word spoken in shapeless night, the   
sharp tool paring away 
waste and the forms 
cut out of mystery! 

When taut string’s note 
passes ears’ reach or red rays or violet   
fade, strong over unseen 
forces the word 
ranks and enumerates... 

mimes clouds condensed 
and hewn hills and bristling forests,   
steadfast corn in its season 
and the seasons 
in their due array, 

life of man’s own body 
and death... 
                  The sound thins into melody,   
discourse narrowing, craft 
failing, design 
petering out. 

Ears heavy to breeze of speech and   
thud of the ictus.

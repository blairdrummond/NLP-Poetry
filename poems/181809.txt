text : 
The first morning after anyone’s death, is it important 
To know that fields are wet, that the governess is 
Naked but with a scarf still covering her head, that 
She’s sitting on a gardener who’s wearing 
Just a blue shirt, or that he’s sitting on a chair in the kitchen. 
They look like they are rowing while instead outside in the mist 
Two boats are passing on the river, the gardener’s mouth 
Is opening: 

A white, screaming bird lifts off the river into the trees, 
Flies a short distance and is joined 
By a second bird, but then as if to destroy everything 
The two white birds are met by a third. The night 
Always fails. The cows are now standing in the barns. 
You can hear the milk as it drills into wooden pails.

Child 
You've boarded me over like a window or a well. 

Mother 
It was autumn 
I couldn't hear the students 
only the music coming in the window,   
Se tu m’ami 
If you love me 

I went for a week's journey in soft ermine.   
Darling, the ovals of your hair ... 
autumn leaves, 
your hair the hue of rain-drenched bark, your voice: 

Don't ever leave me ... 

And this child, this 
window in my side, 
boarded over all my life, 
—how can I take the boards off, in this wind?   
I will break if I bend ...

title : The Force That through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower

author : Dylan Thomas

text : 
The force that through the green fuse drives the flower   
Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees   
Is my destroyer. 
And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose 
My youth is bent by the same wintry fever. 

The force that drives the water through the rocks   
Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams   
Turns mine to wax. 
And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins 
How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks. 

The hand that whirls the water in the pool 
Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind   
Hauls my shroud sail. 
And I am dumb to tell the hanging man 
How of my clay is made the hangman’s lime. 

The lips of time leech to the fountain head;   
Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood   
Shall calm her sores. 
And I am dumb to tell a weather’s wind 
How time has ticked a heaven round the stars. 

And I am dumb to tell the lover’s tomb 
How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.

(For Eric Walrond)
Once riding in old Baltimore,   
   Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,   
I saw a Baltimorean 
   Keep looking straight at me. 

Now I was eight and very small, 
   And he was no whit bigger, 
And so I smiled, but he poked out 
   His tongue, and called me, “Nigger.” 

I saw the whole of Baltimore 
   From May until December; 
Of all the things that happened there 
   That’s all that I remember.

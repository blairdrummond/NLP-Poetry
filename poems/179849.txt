title : Shroud of the Gnome

And what amazes me is that none of our modern inventions 
surprise or interest him, even a little. I tell him 
it is time he got his booster shots, but then 
I realize I have no power over him whatsoever. 
He becomes increasingly light-footed until I lose sight 
of him downtown between the federal building and 
the post office. A registered nurse is taking her 
coffee break. I myself needed a break, so I sat down 
next to her at the counter. "Don't mind me," I said, 
"I'm just a hungry little Gnostic in need of a sandwich." 
(This old line of mine had met with great success 
on any number of previous occasions.) I thought, 
a deaf, dumb, and blind nurse, sounds ideal! 
But then I remembered that some of the earliest 
Paleolithic office workers also feigned blindness 
when approached by nonoffice workers, so I paid my bill 
and disappeared down an alley where I composed myself. 
Amidst the piles of outcast citizenry and burning barrels 
of waste and rot, the plump rats darting freely, 
the havoc of blown newspapers, lay the little shroud 
of my lost friend: small and gray and threadbare, 
windworn by the ages of scurrying hither and thither, 
battered by the avalanches and private tornadoes 
of just being a gnome, but surely there were good times, too. 
And now, rejuvenated by the wind, the shroud moves forward, 
hesitates, dances sideways, brushes my foot as if for a kiss, 
and flies upward, whistling a little-known ballad 
about the pitiful, raw etiquette of the underworld.

title : In Memory of Jane Fraser

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
When snow like sheep lay in the fold   
And winds went begging at each door,   
And the far hills were blue with cold,   
And a cold shroud lay on the moor, 

She kept the siege. And every day   
We watched her brooding over death   
Like a strong bird above its prey. 
The room filled with the kettle’s breath. 

Damp curtains glued against the pane   
Sealed time away. Her body froze   
As if to freeze us all, and chain 
Creation to a stunned repose. 

She died before the world could stir.   
In March the ice unloosed the brook   
And water ruffled the sun’s hair.   
Dead cones upon the alder shook.

Rhymed Stanza

A mountainous and mystic brute 
No rein can curb, no arrow shoot, 
Upon whose doomed deformed back 
I sweep the planets' scorching track.

Old is the elf, and wise, men say,
His hair grows green as ours grows grey; 
He mocks the stars with myriad hands, 
High as that swinging forest stands.

But though in pigmy wanderings dull 
I scour the deserts of his skull, 
I never find the face, eyes, teeth, 
Lowering or laughing underneath.

I met my foe in an empty dell,
His face in the sun was naked hell.
I thought, 'One silent, bloody blow,
No priest would curse, no crowd would know.'

Then cowered: a daisy, half concealed, 
Watched for the fame of that poor field; 
And in that flower and suddenly
Earth opened its one eye on me.

Nailing up chicken wire on the frame house, 
or using a chalk line, or checking a level at a glance 
gets to be easy. 
                        We install double-pane windows 
pressurized with argon between the panes 
for elevations over 4500´. 
                                       And use pick and shovel 
to dig for the footing for the annex. Lay cinder blocks, 
and check levels. Pour the cement floor, and 
use wood float and steel trowel to finish the surface 
as it sets. 
                Nailing into rough, dense, knotted 
two-by-twelves, or using a chalk line to mark the locations 
of the fire blocks, or checking the level of a 
stained eight-by-ten window header gets to be 
easier. 
          In nailing up chicken wire, we know 
how to cut for the canal, pull the wire up over the 
fire wall, make cuts for the corners, tuck it 
around back, and nail two-head nails into the stud. 
And when the footing is slightly uneven and we are 
laying a first row of cinder blocks, know that a 
small pebble under a corner often levels the top 
to the row. 
                And, starting on rock lath, the various 
stages of a house - cutting vigas, cleaning aspens for 
latillas, installing oak doors, or plastering the 
adobe wall - are facets of a cut opal.

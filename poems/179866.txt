title : The Northeast Corridor

text : 
The bar in the commuter station steams 
like a ruin, its fourth wall open 
to the crowd and the fluttering timetables. 
In the farthest corner, the television 
crackles a torch song and a beaded gown. 
She is my favorite singer, dead when I was born. 
And I have been waiting for hours for a train, 
exhausted between connections to small cities, 
awake only in my eyes finding shelter 
in the fluttering ribbon of shadow 
around the dead woman singing on the screen. 
Exhaustion is a last line of defense 
where time either stops dead or kills you. 
It teaches you to see what your eyes see 
without questions, without the politics 
of living in one city, dying in another. 

How badly I would like to sleep now 
in the shadows beside real things or beside 
things that were real once, like the beaded gown 
on the television, like the debut 
of a song in New York in black and white 
when my parents were there. I feel sometimes 
my life was used up before I was born. 
My eyes sear backwards into my head 
to the makeshift of what I have already seen 
or heard described or dreamed about, too weary 
not to envy the world its useless outlines. 
Books of photographs of New York in the forties. 
The dark rhombus of a window of a train 
rushing past my train. The dark halo 
around the body of a woman I love 
from something much farther than a distance. 

The world is insatiable. It takes your legs off, 
it takes your arms and parades in front of you 
such wonderful things, such pictures of warm houses 
trellised along the sides with green so deep 
it is like black air, only transparent, 
of women singing, of trains of lithium 
on the awakening body of a landscape 
or across the backdrop of an old city 
steaming and high-shouldered as the nineteen-forties. 
The world exhausts everything except my eyes 
because it is a long walk to the world 
begun before I was born. In the far corner 
the dead woman bows off stage. The television   
crumples into a white dot as the last 
train of the evening, my train, is announced. 
I lived in one place. I want to die in another.

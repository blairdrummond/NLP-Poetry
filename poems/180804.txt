title : "Behold, the grave of a wicked man"

author : Stephen Crane

text : 
Behold, the grave of a wicked man,
And near it, a stern spirit.
There came a drooping maid with violets, 
But the spirit grasped her arm.
“No flowers for him,” he said.
The maid wept: 
“Ah, I loved him.”
But the spirit, grim and frowning: 
“No flowers for him.” 

Now, this is it —
If the spirit was just,
Why did the maid weep?

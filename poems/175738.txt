title : The Wind Chimes

author : Shirley Buettner

text : 
Two wind chimes, 
one brass and prone to anger, 
one with the throat of an angel, 
swing from my porch eave, 
sing with the storm. 
Last year I lived five months 
under that shrill choir, 
boxing your house, crowding books 
into crates, from some pages 
your own voice crying. 
Some days the chimes raged. 
Some days they hung still. 
They fretted when I dug up 
the lily I gave you in April, 
blooming, strangely, in fall. 
Together, they scolded me 
when I counted pennies you left 
in each can, cup, and drawer, 
when I rechecked the closets 
for remnants of you. 
The last day, the house empty, 
resonant with space, the two chimes 
had nothing to toll for. 
I walked out, took them down, 
carried our mute spirits home.

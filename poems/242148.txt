title : Eve Revisited

author : Alison Hawthorne Deming

text : 
Pomegranates fell from the trees
 in our sleep. If we stayed
 in the sun too long
 there were aloes
 to cool the burn.
 Henbane for predators
 and succulents when the rain was scarce.
  
 There was no glorified past
 to point the way
 true and natural
 for the sexes to meet.
 He kept looking to the heavens
 as if the answer were anywhere
 but here. I was so bored
 with our goodness
 I couldn’t suck the juice
 from one more pear.
  
 It’s here, I kept telling him,
 here, rooted in the soil
 like every other tree
 you know. And I wove us
 a bed of its uppermost branches.

title : The Clearing

author : Carl Little

The sunbox lies in pieces, 
its strips of aluminum foil 
flaking away to the wind, 
tanning platform broken up 
for kindling. Planted grass 
sprouts where the path once 
sharply turned to the left 
circumventing underbrush, 
there the man (a boy then) 
stumbled on beauty’s wrath: 
pale sisters yelling him off, 
scrambling for clothes to cover.

All has been cleared, thick 
cat briar raked into piles 
and set ablaze, invincible 
ailanthus stacked for dump. 
All’s clear and calm save 
his childhood rushing head- 
long through tearing thickets, 
and the sisters, barely glimpsed 
against reflective flashing, 
laughing after him, then
lying back to catch 
all the sullen autumn sun they can.

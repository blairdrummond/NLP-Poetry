title : Madam’s Past History

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
My name is Johnson— 
Madam Alberta K. 
The Madam stands for business.   
I’m smart that way. 

I had a 
HAIR-DRESSING PARLOR   
Before 
The depression put 
The prices lower. 

Then I had a 
BARBECUE STAND   
Till I got mixed up   
With a no-good man. 

Cause I had a insurance   
The WPA 
Said, We can’t use you   
Wealthy that way. 

I said, 
DON’T WORRY ’BOUT ME! 
Just like the song, 
You WPA folks take care of yourself— 
And I’ll get along. 

I do cooking, 
Day’s work, too! 
Alberta K. Johnson— 
Madam to you.

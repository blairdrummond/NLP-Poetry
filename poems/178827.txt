title : Song from a Country Fair

author : Léonie Adams

text : 
When tunes jigged nimbler than the blood   
And quick and high the bows would prance   
And every fiddle string would burst 
To catch what’s lost beyond the string,   
While half afraid their children stood,   
I saw the old come out to dance. 
The heart is not so light at first, 
But heavy like a bough in spring.

After Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel
His Exterior

a face like a moving picture   
a head like a jar of pennies   
a skull like a geode 
skin with a black line running down it   
epidermis like a wool sweater   
whiskers like a street sweeper   
and hair like a cloudy day.

How He Acts 

If he laughs, it’s spontaneous combustion   
If he mutters, it’s a retreating glacier 
If he pouts, he sharpens his horn on stones 
If he jumps up and down, its hard to look away 
If he scratches himself, it’s with an aspen branch 
If he gets angry, he fights with tooth, horn, and heel   
If he spits, he fights his own kind   
If he blows his nose, it starts a riot   
If he sweats, it’s monsoons 
If he coughs, it unlocks doors in the next room 
If he argues, it’s over lost rituals 
If he sighs, it ruffles goldfinch feathers   
If he whistles, it’s overheard miles away   
If he snores, it’s over nostalgic reveries 
If he scowls, spears launch from his eyes   
If he snorts, it’s over gilt lion-head spouts   
If he shits, it’s historical documents   
If he belches, it’s a diary 
If he vomits, there’s finger-pointing all around 
If he walks, it’s Chaplin 
If he writes, it’s manifestos 
If he goes shopping, it’s for lentils and peas   
If he dances, it’s the Rites of Spring   
If he swears, he’s a ryght cruell beast 
If he drives, it’s among the Mountains of the Moon   
If he bathes, it’s in deceptive surfaces   
If he dresses, it’s a white linen suit   
If he wonders, it’s if his own reflection   
If he’s jealous, it’s of birthday parties   
If he lies, it’s about mathematical errors   
If he spends money, it’s on magic lanterns   
If he goes to the movies, it’s Vertigo 
If he listens to music, it’s the sound of running water 
If he falls, it’s down a slope of turf into the bushes   
If he recites, it’s from the Beast Epic of Alexandria   
If he is seduced, it’s a river of electricity 
If he is curious, he attempts to draw 
If he calls, it’s about weather patterns 
If he sings, it’s ‘Tyger, Tyger’ 
and if he escapes, he’s swift of foot.

title : Female Masculinity

author : Wayne Koestenbaum

text : 
Two guys sucking each other in the steam room
 didn’t want anything
 to do with me, evidently—
 I left them to their comedy.
  
                                      *
  
 Legato longings:
 wish for walnuts, wish for water,
 wish to exorcise this morning’s debauch—
 two Fauré nocturnes.
  
                                      *
  
 In slow motion
 Steve tussled with a motorcycle
 trying to run me over
 on the boulevard of moon smut
  
 splicing together bridges
 and lagoons, like the bride
 of Frankenstein rushing
 to overtake the inert
  
 Real, a mass
 of facts, some conjugal,
 some comic—
 contrapuntal tenebrae!

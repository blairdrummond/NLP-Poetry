title : Up on Top

author : Olav H. Hauge

text : 
After stumbling a long time over impossible trails   
you are up on top.   
Hardship didn't crush you, you trod it   
down, climbed higher. 

That's how you see it. After life has tossed you   
away, and you ended up on top   
like a one-legged wooden horse on a dump.   
Life is merciful, it blinds and provides illusions,   
and destiny takes on our burden:   
foolishness and arrogance become mountains and marshy places,   
hate and resentment become wounds from enemy arrows,   
and the doubt always with us becomes cold dry 
rocky valleys. 

You go in the door.   
The pot lies upside down in the hearth,   
it sprawls with hostile black feet.

Rhymed Stanza

Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;
      Eat I must, and sleep I will, ? and would that night were here!
But ah! ? to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!
      Would that it were day again! ? with twilight near!

Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;
      This or that or what you will is all the same to me;
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, ?
      There's little use in anything as far as I can see.

Love has gone and left me, ? and the neighbors knock and borrow,
      And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, ?
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
      There's this little street and this little house.

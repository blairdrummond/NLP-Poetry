title : Queer People

author : Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman

text : 
The people people work with best
   Are often very queer
The people people own by birth
   Quite shock your first idea;
The people people choose for friends
   Your common sense appall,
But the people people marry
   Are the queerest folks of all.

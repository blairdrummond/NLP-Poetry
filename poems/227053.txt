title : These Lacustrine Cities

author : John Ashbery

text : 
These lacustrine cities grew out of loathing 
Into something forgetful, although angry with history. 
They are the product of an idea: that man is horrible, for instance,   
Though this is only one example. 

They emerged until a tower 
Controlled the sky, and with artifice dipped back 
Into the past for swans and tapering branches, 
Burning, until all that hate was transformed into useless love. 

Then you are left with an idea of yourself 
And the feeling of ascending emptiness of the afternoon   
Which must be charged to the embarrassment of others   
Who fly by you like beacons. 

The night is a sentinel. 
Much of your time has been occupied by creative games 
Until now, but we have all-inclusive plans for you. 
We had thought, for instance, of sending you to the middle of the desert, 

To a violent sea, or of having the closeness of the others be air   
To you, pressing you back into a startled dream 
As sea-breezes greet a child’s face. 
But the past is already here, and you are nursing some private project. 

The worst is not over, yet I know 
You will be happy here. Because of the logic 
Of your situation, which is something no climate can outsmart.   
Tender and insouciant by turns, you see 

You have built a mountain of something, 
Thoughtfully pouring all your energy into this single monument,   
Whose wind is desire starching a petal, 
Whose disappointment broke into a rainbow of tears.

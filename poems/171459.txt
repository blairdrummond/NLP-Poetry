title : The End of an Ethnic Dream

author : Jay Wright

text : 
Cigarettes in my mouth 
to puncture blisters in my brain.   
My bass a fine piece of furniture.   
My fingers soft, too soft to rattle   
rafters in second-rate halls. 
The harmonies I could never learn   
stick in Ayler's screams. 
An African chant chokes us. My image shot. 

If you look off over the Hudson, 
the dark cooperatives spit at the dinghies   
floating up the night. 

                A young boy pisses 
on lovers rolling against each other   
under a trackless el. 

         This could have been my town, 
with light strings that could stand a tempo. 

                  Now, 
                  it's the end 
                  of an ethnic dream. 

I've grown intellectual, 
go on accumulating furniture and books,   
damning literature, writing “for myself,”   
calculating the possibilities that someone   
will love me, or sleep with me. 
Eighteen-year-old girls come back from the Southern   
leers and make me cry. 

                  Here, there are 
                  coffee shops, bars, 
                  natural tonsorial parlors,   
                  plays, streets, 
                  pamphlets, days, sun, 
                  heat, love, anger,   
                  politics, days, and sun. 

Here, we shoot off 
every day to new horizons,   
coffee shops, bars, 
natural tonsorial parlors,   
plays, streets, 
pamphlets, days, sun, 
heat, love, anger, 
politics, days, and sun. 

                  It is the end of an ethnic dream.   
                  My bass a fine piece of furniture.   
                  My brain blistered.

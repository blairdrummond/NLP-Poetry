title : Lost Desire

author : Meleager

text : 
Love brought by night a vision to my bed,
One that still wore the vesture of a child
But eighteen years of age – who sweetly smiled
Till of the lovely form false hopes were bred
            And keen embraces wild.
Ah! for the lost desire that haunts me yet,
Till mine eyes fail in sleep that finds no more
That fleeting ghost! Oh, lovelorn heart, give o’er –
Cease thy vain dreams of beauty’s warmth – forget
            The face thou longest for!

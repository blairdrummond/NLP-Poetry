title : The Kiss

author : Kirmen Uribe

My breasts are small and my eyes round.   
Your legs long and cool as the freshet 
that runs down from the fountain. 
I bite your neck, 
it’s sturdy, still not yet ripe, 
like a walnut that has just now fallen. 
You clamber on top, start kissing my middle,   
strew wet wavelets all over my skin, 
now up here, now down there, 
like the first fat drops to fall before 
the storm starts, splat, splat, splat. 

We’ve gone to sleep back to chest,   
the way lips rejoin   
after sighing.

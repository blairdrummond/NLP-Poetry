Rhymed Stanza

O joys! infinite sweetness! with what flow'rs
And shoots of glory my soul breaks and buds!
               All the long hours
               Of night, and rest,
               Through the still shrouds
               Of sleep, and clouds,
       This dew fell on my breast;
       Oh, how it bloods
And spirits all my earth! Hark! In what rings
And hymning circulations the quick world
               Awakes and sings;
               The rising winds
               And falling springs,
               Birds, beasts, all things
       Adore him in their kinds.
               Thus all is hurl'd
In sacred hymns and order, the great chime
And symphony of nature. Prayer is
               The world in tune,
               A spirit voice,
               And vocal joys
       Whose echo is heav'n's bliss.
               O let me climb
When I lie down! The pious soul by night
Is like a clouded star whose beams, though said
               To shed their light
               Under some cloud,
               Yet are above,
               And shine and move
       Beyond that misty shroud.
               So in my bed,
That curtain'd grave, though sleep, like ashes, hide
My lamp and life, both shall in thee abide.

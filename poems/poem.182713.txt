'Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh; for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.'  Proverbs, 23: 20, 21 
I'll tell you two fortunes, my fine little lad, 
      For you to accept or refuse. 
The one of them good, and the other one bad; 
      Now hear them, and say which you choose! 

I see by my gift, within reach of your hand, 
      A fortune right fair to behold; 
A house and a hundred good acres of land, 
      With harvest fields yellow as gold. 

I see a great orchard, the boughs hanging down 
      With apples of russet and red; 
I see droves of cattle, some white and brown, 
      But all of them sleek and well-fed. 

I see doves and swallows about the barn doors, 
      See the fanning-mill whirling so fast, 
See men that are threshing the wheat on the floors; 
      And now the bright picture is past! 

And I see, rising dismally up in the place 
      Of the beautiful house and the land, 
A man with a fire-red nose on his face, 
      And a little brown jug in his hand! 

Oh! if you beheld him, my lad, you would wish 
      That he were less wretched to see; 
For his boot-toes, they gape like the mouth of a fish, 
      And his trousers are out at the knee! 

In walking he staggers, now this way, now that, 
      And his eyes they stand out like a bug's, 
And he wears an old coat and a battered-in hat, 
      And I think that the fault is the jug's! 

For our text says the drunkard shall come to be poor, 
      And drowsiness clothes men with rags; 
And he doesn't look much like a man, I am sure, 
      Who has honest hard cash in his bags. 

Now which will you choose? to be thrifty and snug, 
      And to be right side up with your dish; 
Or to go with your eyes like the eyes of a bug, 
      And your shoes like the mouth of a fish!

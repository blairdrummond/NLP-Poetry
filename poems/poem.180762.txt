Astrophil and Stella 5: It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve 
Sir Philip Sidney 
1554-1586
Renaissance
England
Love, Realistic & Complicated



It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve 
The inward light; and that the heavenly part 
Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve, 
Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart. 
    It is most true, what we call Cupid's dart, 
An image is, which for ourselves we carve; 
And, fools, adore in temple of our heart, 
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve. 
    True, that true beauty virtue is indeed, 
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade, 
Which elements with mortal mixture breed; 
True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made, 
    And should in soul up to our country move; 
True; and yet true, that I must Stella love.

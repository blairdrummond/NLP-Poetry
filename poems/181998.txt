title : Cancer and Complaint at Midsummer

author : C. Dale Young

text : 
Because the silence of the dead, 
that blue expanse of sky about 
to ashen here above my head, 
is easily ignored, our tears 
are blamed on flowers whitening limbs 
of trees, the very air, with hymns 
of summer pollen no one hears 
except for womenâ€”old, devout. 

And now, these humid months, dispute 
them not: midsummer has no name 
among the dead, no Latin root 
to which it can be traced, no swarm 
of conjugations to decipher. 
So little left to write this summer, 
my mind now weak in handling form, 
which I still cling to just the same.

La poesie vit d’insomnie perpetuelle  —René Char
There’s a sickness in me. During   
the night I wake up & it’s brought 

a stain into my mouth, as if 
an ocean has risen & left back 

a stink on the rocks of my teeth.   
I stink. My mouth is ugly, human 

stink. A color like rust 
is in me. I can’t get rid of it. 

It rises after I 
brush my teeth, a taste 

like iron. In the 
night, left like a dream, 

a caustic light 
washing over the insides of me. 

* 

What to do with my arms? They   
coil out of my body 

like snakes. 
They branch & spit. 

I want to shake myself   
until they fall like withered 

roots; until 
they bend the right way— 

until I fit in them,   
or they in me. 

I have to lay them down as   
carefully as an old wedding dress, 

I have to fold them 
like the arms of someone dead. 

The house is quiet; all   
night I struggle. All 

because of my arms,   
which have no peace! 

* 

I’m a martyr, a girl who’s been dead   
two thousand years. I turn 

on my left side, like one comfortable   
after a long, hard death. 

The angels look down 
tenderly. “She’s sleeping,” they say 

& pass me by. But 
all night, I am passing 

in & out of my body   
on my naked feet. 

* 

I’m awake when I’m sleeping & I’m   
sleeping when I’m awake, & no one 

knows, not even me, for my eyes   
are closed to myself. 

I think I am thinking I see 
a man beside me, & he thinks 

in his sleep that I’m awake   
writing. I hear a pen scratch 

a paper. There is some idea   
I think is clever: I want to 

capture myself in a book. 

* 

I have to make a   
place for my body in 

my body. I’m like a   
dog pawing a blanket 

on the floor. I have to   
turn & twist myself 

like a rag until I 
can smell myself in myself. 

I’m sweating; the water is   
pouring out of me 

like silver. I put my head   
in the crook of my arm 

like a brilliant moon. 

* 

The bones of my left foot   
are too heavy on the bones 

of my right. They 
lie still for a little while, 

sleeping, but soon they   
bruise each other like 

angry twins. Then 
the bones of my right foot 

command the bones of my left   
to climb down.

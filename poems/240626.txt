title : El Olvido

author : Judith Ortiz Cofer

text : 
It is a dangerous thing
 to forget the climate of your birthplace,
 to choke out the voices of dead relatives
 when in dreams they call you
 by your secret name.
 It is dangerous
 to spurn the clothes you were born to wear
 for the sake of fashion; dangerous
 to use weapons and sharp instruments
 you are not familiar with; dangerous
 to disdain the plaster saints
 before which your mother kneels
 praying with embarrassing fervor
 that you survive in the place you have chosen to live:
 a bare, cold room with no pictures on the walls,
 a forgetting place where she fears you will die
 of loneliness and exposure.
 Jesús, María, y José, she says, 
 el olvido is a dangerous thing.

Philosophic 
in its complex, ovoid emptiness, 
a skillful pundit coined it as a sort 
       of stopgap doorstop for those 
                     quaint equations 

                     Romans never 
dreamt of. In form completely clever 
and discrete—a mirror come unsilvered, 
       loose watch face without the works, 
                     a hollowed globe 

                     from tip to toe 
unbroken, it evades the grappling 
hooks of mass, tilts the thin rim of no thing, 
      remains embryonic sum, 
                   non-cogito.

for memorial at Zinc Bar, 23 June 2007, NYC                         I am your sugarplum fairy commodore in chief.                                         —kari edwards                              conturbabimus illa                             (vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus [let us live,                            my Lesbia, and let us love])                                       —Catullus V.II
damesirs of fishairs
 princes reginae
 I dont need this botheration
 guilded toe in a gendered pension
 embedded narcissism
 skirts can or could be worn w/
  
 intentional disgrace
 getting oh-aff
 I sleep where I sit
 gog and magog
 ope myopia
  
 sweetness and delight do
 it for sidney, as starlover did rue
 on star, thir mistress cloying
 the lack, with thir poesis toying
  
 twill never hurt
 regina prince
 alack, areft
 locks beset
 candle agrove
 a buck in a corridor
  
 as like with likeness grace the tongue
 and sweets with sweets cloy them among
  
 conturbabimus illa
 let us confound them
  
 beasts implored and character impaled
 agathas breast in a 14th century pincer anon
 7 heads w/ 7 comings on
 horns on their horns
 wings at their feet and at their wings
  
 well you have three seconds to live
 bespeckled apprentice
 freckled daylilly
 a penny uneasily 
 pleaded myrtle
  
 iron bootblackening
 at the speed
 we levatate con
 there is no missus
 I am among
  
 limbed elms
 colluding with doves
  
 nor tide nor tail
 angels w/ svelte angles
  
 the rub and tug goils
 languid as jersey
 too early for supper
  
 etc was their pimp
 and whatever their sucker
 shitslinger
 master cleanser
  
 w/ corporate coffee
 and torture pâté
  
 my present page
 in l-l-livery
  
 old glut
 of a beast’s spleen
 the glory over
 lordling socked ajaw
  
 nassau ablog
 by fairly a sweepmate a swoopster
 bedeviled in gullet
 swashbuckld by proxy
  
 homosexuality eh?
 red river andaloos
 funny albeit friday
 all the dork-rock
  
 gender suggests
 we levitate avec
 held captive
 patrón, bothermonger
  
 ah myrtle
 why sie is taken
 my mind
 impertinent parasol
  
 glossy wit promise of salt
 caint leave thir cellphone alone
 ipode eternal
 satellite viscera
  
 muscadetted papillon (that one)
  
 strident
 17 stallions
 with horns on their heads
 and horns coming out of the horns
  
 a papillon
 that one
  
 a buck in a corridor
 conturbabimus illa
 let us confound them
  
 all ridded of giggling
 anthropomorphia aghast
 DL in the bowries
 the tee hee ambigenuity
 of amputee-wannabees
  
 googling tee hee
 silly faggot
 dicks are for chicks
 dicks are for chicks
  
 wicked hee
 to bury my heart at
 my heart was in my knee

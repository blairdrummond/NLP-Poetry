title : Calais

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
They tin-opened his head.
Apparently it said
CALAIS across his brain
in red. Which should explain
the puzzlement and pain
and focus that he felt,
that afternoon he smelt 
its fuel-and-fishy air,
then mulled it over in a square

like one whom little girls
untasselling their hair
in French and combing it to curls
adore when heâ€™s thirteen,

who wonders what on earth they mean
and guesses and is wrong,
goes pink and carries on,
finds the ferry gone.

title : If Ever There Was One

author : Miller Williams

text : 
She could tell he loved her. He wanted her there   
sitting in the front pew when he preached.   
He liked to watch her putting up her hair 
and ate whatever she cooked and never broached 

the subject of the years before they met.   
He was thoughtful always. He let her say   
whether or not they did anything in bed 
and tried to learn the games she tried to play. 

She could tell how deep his feeling ran. 
He liked to say her name and bought her stuff   
for no good reason. He was a gentle man.   
How few there are she knew well enough. 

He sometimes reached to flick away a speck   
of something on her clothes and didn’t drum   
his fingers on the table when she spoke. 
What would he do if he knew she had a dream 

sometimes, slipping out of her nightgown— 
if ever God forbid he really knew her— 
to slip once out of the house and across town   
and find someone to talk dirty to her.

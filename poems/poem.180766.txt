Delia 1: Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty

Renaissance
England
Love, Romantic Love, Infatuation & Crushes



Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty 
Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal: 
Returning thee the tribute of my duty, 
Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal. 
Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul, 
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care: 
Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll 
How they were spent for thee; look what they are. 
Look on the dear expenses of my youth, 
And see how just I reckon with thine eyes: 
Examine well thy beauty with my truth, 
And cross my cares ere greater sum arise. 
Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly; 
Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.

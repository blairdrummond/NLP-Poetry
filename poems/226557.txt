title : Spaces We Leave Empty

author : Cathy Song

text : 
The jade slipped from my wrist   
with the smoothness of water   
leaving the mountains, 

silk falling from a shoulder, 
melon slices sliding across the tongue,   
the fish returning. 

The bracelet worn since my first birthday   
cracked into thousand-year-old eggshells.   
The sound could be heard 
ringing across the water 

where my mother woke in her sleep crying thief.   
Her nightgown slapped in the wind   
as he howled clutching his hoard. 

The cultured pearls.   
The bone flutes. 
The peppermint disks of jade. 

The clean hole 
in the center, Heaven:   
the spaces we left empty.

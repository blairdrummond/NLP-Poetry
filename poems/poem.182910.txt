Allusion, Metaphor

All overgrown by cunning moss, 
All interspersed with weed, 
The little cage of "Currer Bell" 
In quiet "Haworth" laid. 

This Bird - observing others 
When frosts too sharp became 
Retire to other latitudes - 
Quietly did the same - 

But differed in returning - 
Since Yorkshire hills are green - 
Yet not in all the nests I meet - 
Can Nightingale be seen -

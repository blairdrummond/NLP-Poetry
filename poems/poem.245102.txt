Renascence 
Edna St. Vincent Millay 
1892-1950

U.S., New, England




All I could see from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood;
 I turned and looked another way,
 And saw three islands in a bay.
 So with my eyes I traced the line 
 Of the horizon, thin and fine,
 Straight around till I was come
 Back to where I'd started from; 
 And all I saw from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood.
  
 Over these things I could not see;
 These were the things that bounded me;
 And I could touch them with my hand,
 Almost, I thought, from where I stand.
 And all at once things seemed so small
 My breath came short, and scarce at all.
  
 But, sure, the sky is big, I said;
 Miles and miles above my head;
 So here upon my back I'll lie
 And look my fill into the sky.
 And so I looked, and, after all,
 The sky was not so very tall.
 The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,
 And--sure enough!--I see the top! 
 The sky, I thought, is not so grand;
 I 'most could touch it with my hand!
 And reaching up my hand to try,
 I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
  
 I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity
 Came down and settled over me;
 Forced back my scream into my chest,
 Bent back my arm upon my breast,
 And, pressing of the Undefined
 The definition on my mind,
 Held up before my eyes a glass
 Through which my shrinking sight did pass
 Until it seemed I must behold
 Immensity made manifold;
 Whispered to me a word whose sound
 Deafened the air for worlds around,
 And brought unmuffled to my ears
 The gossiping of friendly spheres,
 The creaking of the tented sky,
 The ticking of Eternity.
  
 I saw and heard, and knew at last
 The How and Why of all things, past,
 And present, and forevermore.
 The Universe, cleft to the core,
 Lay open to my probing sense
 That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence
 But could not,--nay! But needs must suck
 At the great wound, and could not pluck
 My lips away till I had drawn
 All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!
 For my omniscience paid I toll
 In infinite remorse of soul.
  
 All sin was of my sinning, all
 Atoning mine, and mine the gall
 Of all regret. Mine was the weight 
 Of every brooded wrong, the hate
 That stood behind each envious thrust,
 Mine every greed, mine every lust.
  
 And all the while for every grief,
 Each suffering, I craved relief
 With individual desire,--
 Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
 About a thousand people crawl;
 Perished with each,--then mourned for all!
  
 A man was starving in Capri;
 He moved his eyes and looked at me;
 I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,
 And knew his hunger as my own.
 I saw at sea a great fog bank
 Between two ships that struck and sank;
 A thousand screams the heavens smote;
 And every scream tore through my throat.
  
 No hurt I did not feel, no death
 That was not mine; mine each last breath
 That, crying, met an answering cry
 From the compassion that was I.
 All suffering mine, and mine its rod;
 Mine, pity like the pity of God.
  
 Ah, awful weight! Infinity
 Pressed down upon the finite Me!
 My anguished spirit, like a bird,
 Beating against my lips I heard;
 Yet lay the weight so close about
 There was no room for it without.
 And so beneath the weight lay I
 And suffered death, but could not die.
  
 Long had I lain thus, craving death,
 When quietly the earth beneath
 Gave way, and inch by inch, so great
 At last had grown the crushing weight,
 Into the earth I sank till I
 Full six feet under ground did lie,
 And sank no more,--there is no weight
 Can follow here, however great.
 From off my breast I felt it roll,
 And as it went my tortured soul
 Burst forth and fled in such a gust
 That all about me swirled the dust.
  
 Deep in the earth I rested now;
 Cool is its hand upon the brow
 And soft its breast beneath the head
 Of one who is so gladly dead.
 And all at once, and over all
 The pitying rain began to fall;
 I lay and heard each pattering hoof
 Upon my lowly, thatched roof,
 And seemed to love the sound far more
 Than ever I had done before.
 For rain it hath a friendly sound
 To one who's six feet underground;
 And scarce the friendly voice or face:
 A grave is such a quiet place.
  
 The rain, I said, is kind to come
 And speak to me in my new home.
 I would I were alive again
 To kiss the fingers of the rain,
 To drink into my eyes the shine
 Of every slanting silver line,
 To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze
 From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
 For soon the shower will be done,
 And then the broad face of the sun
 Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
 Until the world with answering mirth
 Shakes joyously, and each round drop
 Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.
  
 How can I bear it; buried here,
 While overhead the sky grows clear
 And blue again after the storm?
 O, multi-colored, multiform,
 Beloved beauty over me,
 That I shall never, never see
 Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,
 That I shall never more behold!
 Sleeping your myriad magics through,
 Close-sepulchred away from you!
 O God, I cried, give me new birth,
 And put me back upon the earth!
 Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
 And let the heavy rain, down-poured
 In one big torrent, set me free,
 Washing my grave away from me!
  
 I ceased; and through the breathless hush
 That answered me, the far-off rush
 Of herald wings came whispering
 Like music down the vibrant string
 Of my ascending prayer, and--crash!
 Before the wild wind's whistling lash
 The startled storm-clouds reared on high
 And plunged in terror down the sky,
 And the big rain in one black wave
 Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
  
 I know not how such things can be;
 I only know there came to me
 A fragrance such as never clings
 To aught save happy living things;
 A sound as of some joyous elf
 Singing sweet songs to please himself,
 And, through and over everything,
 A sense of glad awakening.
 The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,
 Whispering to me I could hear;
 I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
 Brushed tenderly across my lips,
 Laid gently on my sealed sight,
 And all at once the heavy night
 Fell from my eyes and I could see,--
 A drenched and dripping apple-tree,
 A last long line of silver rain,
 A sky grown clear and blue again.
 And as I looked a quickening gust
 Of wind blew up to me and thrust
 Into my face a miracle
 Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--
 I know not how such things can be!--
 I breathed my soul back into me.
  
 Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
 And hailed the earth with such a cry
 As is not heard save from a man
 Who has been dead, and lives again.
 About the trees my arms I wound;
  
 Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
 I raised my quivering arms on high;
 I laughed and laughed into the sky,
 Till at my throat a strangling sob
 Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb
 Sent instant tears into my eyes;
 O God, I cried, no dark disguise
 Can e'er hereafter hide from me
 Thy radiant identity!
  
 Thou canst not move across the grass
 But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,
 Nor speak, however silently,
 But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
 I know the path that tells Thy way
 Through the cool eve of every day;
 God, I can push the grass apart
 And lay my finger on Thy heart!
  
 The world stands out on either side
 No wider than the heart is wide;
 Above the world is stretched the sky,--
 No higher than the soul is high.
 The heart can push the sea and land
 Farther away on either hand;
 The soul can split the sky in two,
 And let the face of God shine through.
 But East and West will pinch the heart
 That can not keep them pushed apart;
 And he whose soul is flat--the sky
 Will cave in on him by and by.

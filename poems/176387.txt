title : The Psychotropic Squalls

text : 
To peer into the obverse 
into smoking cane field erratums 
as if haunted with the steamy colitis of whirling iridium   
cancellations 

as in the saliva of newts 
one sees the intestinal raging of deltas 
of blackened sea giraffes osmotically split into simultaneous alums   
above a judgemental sea glistening with Richters 

like a weakened neutron egg 
its fissioning petrol mirages like spirals of irregular hunting geese   
flying through flames of ulcerated smoke & gargantua 
hissing a blank imperial greenness 
rising above dense jetties of cobras 

the shocking demise of the sea 
the unlivingness of its winds 
scorched by irradiations of shaking brine incisions 
the burning gulfs of sun with a glint of explosive Mandean utopias* 
shocks against Old Testament linear prophetics 
of Jeremiah 
or Ezekiel 
or the bony frozen finger shaking stunted alchemical missives   
from a moon burned Judea 
no more than a mechanically burning moat focused on smoky   
spellbinder’s disruptives 
where the motion of the soul is delayed 
reduced to flattened agnostic secular smoke 
to a terrestrial rage which eliminates its sensuous heavenly fires   
its stunning unreplicated angers 
its sudden selenium spirals 
its fire which staggers across the pseudo-faultlines of pre-replicated judgement 
its flirtation with spirits of enriched Draconian plankton 

so that the soul with its amber of flashing microbe drachmas   
with its wounded tourmaline divisibilities 
flaming within a light of smeared tornado weathers   
within a shower of black fish scales & spleen 
is entombed 
within a blank thirstless psycho-motion 
falling from a furnace of stars 
which both flares up and freezes 
which inculcates a flawed microbial botany 
as in hypnotic grammatical emulsions 

within a hollowed elliptical opening where we witness old   
Egyptian surgeries 
where the dead magically rise up from mazes 
& stare in a language of scorching totemic anomaly   
spawned in heretical miniature 
their phantoms 
seeping from quadrilateral sutures 
from brief 
violent 
renunciatory squalls 

uprooted 
armed with the weaponry of ghouls 
& broken birch tree lizards 
seasoned by the light of psychotropic angles 
blazing in the middle of a green Venusian interior God 
singing 
as if 
in the fumaroles of anguish   
with an inclement bleeding   
with a littered corona 
of unstable altimeter reverses

Look at them flit 
Lickety-split 
Wiggling 
Swiggling 
Swerving 
Curving 
Hurrying 
Scurrying 
Chasing 
Racing 
Whizzing 
Whisking 
Flying 
Frisking 
Tearing around 
With a leap and a bound 
But none of them making the tiniest 
                                              tiniest 
                                                 tiniest 
                                                    tiniest 
                                                       tiniest 
                                                          sound

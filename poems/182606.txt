title : To Solitude

author : Alice Cary

text : 
I am weary of the working, 
   Weary of the long day’s heat; 
To thy comfortable bosom, 
   Wilt thou take me, spirit sweet? 

Weary of the long, blind struggle 
   For a pathway bright and high,— 
Weary of the dimly dying 
   Hopes that never quite all die. 

Weary searching a bad cipher 
   For a good that must be meant; 
Discontent with being weary,— 
   Weary with my discontent. 

I am weary of the trusting 
   Where my trusts but torments prove; 
Wilt thou keep faith with me? wilt thou 
   Be my true and tender love? 

I am weary drifting, driving 
   Like a helmless bark at sea; 
Kindly, comfortable spirit, 
   Wilt thou give thyself to me? 

Give thy birds to sing me sonnets? 
   Give thy winds my cheeks to kiss? 
And thy mossy rocks to stand for 
   The memorials of our bliss? 

I in reverence will hold thee, 
   Never vexed with jealous ills, 
Though thy wild and wimpling waters 
   Wind about a thousand hills.

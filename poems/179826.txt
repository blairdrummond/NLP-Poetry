title : Over and Under

author : John Brehm

text : 
So sexy to slide under-
neath a river, 
to sit inside this
snakelike sub-
marine-like 
subway car and
freely imagine
the world above—
the Brooklyn
Bridge invisibly
trembling with the
weight of its 
own beauty, 
the East River
still guided by
the grooves
Walt Whitman's 
eyes wore in it,
the bulldog tug-
boats pushing the
passively impressive
broad-bottomed 
barges around, 
and the double-
decker orange
and black Staten
Island ferries,
with their aura
of overworked
pack-mule
mournfulness,
and beyond them
the Atlantic Ocean
which I lately learned
was brought here
by ice comets three
billion years ago, 
which explains 
a few things, like
why everybody 
feels so alienated,
and of course
the thoughts being
thought by every
person in New
York City at
this moment—
vast schools of
undulating fish
curving and rising 
in the cloud-swirling 
wind-waved sky,
surrounded by
the vaster emptiness
of non-thought 
which holds them
and which they try
not to think 
about and you 
lying in bed in 
your sixth-floor 
walk-up sublet 
on St. Mark's Place—
such a breath-
taking ascension!
imagining me
rising now to meet you.

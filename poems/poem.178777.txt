Sonnet

I scarcely grieve, O Nature! at the lot 
That pent my life within a city's bounds, 
And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds. 
Perhaps I had not learned, if some lone cot 
Had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart 
Taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth 
Had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth. 
Here, too, O Nature! in this haunt of Art, 
Thy power is on me, and I own thy thrall. 
There is no unimpressive spot on earth! 
The beauty of the stars is over all, 
And Day and Darkness visit every hearth. 
Clouds do not scorn us: yonder factory's smoke 
Looked like a golden mist when morning broke.

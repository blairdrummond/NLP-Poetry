The house was just twinkling in the moon light,   
And inside it twinkling with delight, 
Is my baby bright. 
Twinkling with delight in the house twinkling   
with the moonlight, 
Bless my baby bless my baby bright, 
Bless my baby twinkling with delight, 
In the house twinkling in the moon light, 
Her hubby dear loves to cheer when he thinks 
and he always thinks when he knows and he always   
knows that his blessed baby wifey is all here and he 
is all hers, and sticks to her like burrsburrs In the phrase "sticks to her like burrs," these are prickly flower heads. One other definition of a burr is a circle of light about the moon or a star., blessed baby

title : The Afterlife: Letter to Sam Hamill

author : Hayden Carruth

text : 
You may think it strange, Sam, that I'm writing 
a letter in these circumstances. I thought 
it strange tooâ€”the first time. But there's 
a misconception I was laboring under, and you 
are too, viz. that the imagination in your 
vicinity is free and powerful. After all, 
you say, you've been creating yourself all 
along imaginatively. You imagine yourself 
playing golf or hiking in the Olympics or 
writing a poem and then it becomes true. 
But you still have to do it, you have to exert 
yourself, will, courage, whatever you've got, you're 
mired in the unimaginative. Here I imagine a letter 
and it's written. Takes about two-fifths of a 
second, your time. Hell, this is heaven, man. 
I can deluge Congress with letters telling 
every one of those mendacious sons of bitches 
exactly what he or she is, in maybe about 
half an hour. In spite of your Buddhist 
proclivities, when you imagine bliss 
you still must struggle to get there. By the way 
the Buddha has his place across town on 
Elysian Drive. We call him Bud. He's lost weight 
and got new dentures, and he looks a hell of a 
lot better than he used to. He always carries 
a jumping jack with him everywhere just 
for contemplation, but he doesn't make it 
jump. He only looks at it. Meanwhile Sidney 
and Dizzy, Uncle Ben and Papa Yancey, are 
over by Sylvester's Grot making the sweetest, 
cheerfulest blues you ever heard. The air, 
so called, is full of it. Poems are fluttering 
everywhere like seed from a cottonwood tree. 
Sam, the remarkable truth is I can do any 
fucking thing I want. Speaking of which 
there's this dazzling young Naomi who 
wiped out on I-80 just west of Truckee 
last winter, and I think this is the moment 
for me to go and pay her my respects. 
Don't go way. I'll be right back.

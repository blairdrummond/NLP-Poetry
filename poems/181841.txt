title : Old Prairie House Between Tulsa and Bartlesville on US 75

I 

Back in time 
car in yard 
shutters at windows 
paint on gray boards 
old man, old woman 
their children gone 
then man and woman younger 
       with young children 
west wing not yet built on house 
one wagon, horse arrive 
untended land 
back too far 
young man, woman with eyes 
       like bright baubles 
holding space 
one shutter closes on another. 


II 

Grizzled, unpossessed 
on the ledge of plains 
factional roof 
meager walls written upon 
like points of long prairie grass 
the house stares across the highway 
as though remembering a fir tree 
       carried on horseback 
through blinding snow. 


III 

Survival of facade 
when content does not endure 
one part has nothing to do with the others 
all is hollow 
ramshackled 
but house still stands on prairie 
customs still leap on points 
       of delicate prairie grass 
where the bright bauble of the eye 
blinked once too often.

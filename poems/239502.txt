title : [there is a shipwreck . . .]

author : kari edwards

text : 
   there is a shipwreck on each side of innuendo, tears gather around the collective shadow of shadows; none clearer than the last unshakable, anatomically inexplicably, never noticed, next time, please sir, more.
 
  enshrouded by fear, one hundred years after eleven pages of violent reality testing, when the beginning was the final question, outside the disruption of anything hungry on emptiness, suggesting a response of objections, calling on me to speak in tongues.
 
   trying to read the consequential future, apply anything to anything; knowing any application to the current materiality is wretched normality and remote productivity.

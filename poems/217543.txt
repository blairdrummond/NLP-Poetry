title : What I Know About Epistemology

As the light goes, go. 
Be the rustling in the grass, the fall from 
convention's good graces: learn, or someone 
will have you filing files or writing writs, 
demonstrating cutlery or selling knowledge 

door to door; someone might even drop 
your lovely life into a factory and have you 
derusting rings on the coolant-spouting 
turntable of a vertical lathe. 
It's best for everyone that what you know 

is generally thought of as general knowledge. 
You can find it in pool rooms and roadside bars, 
in meadows as inviting as beds, in bedrooms 
where it whispers like a ribbon untying; 
you can even find it in schools. But be careful: 

it's dangerous, inescapable and exact 
down to every atom of everything there is, 
to every name each thing goes by and every 
law each thing obeys. And the best part is, 
you always know more than you know.

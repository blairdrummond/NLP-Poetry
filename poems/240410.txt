title : Winter in Gold River

author : Catie Rosemurgy

text : 
Pretty girl. The weather has knocked her down again
 and given her to the lake to wear as a skin.
  
 Why am I always being the weather?
 There were days in the winter
 when her smile was so lovely I felt
 the breathing of my own goodness,
  
 though it remained fetal and separate.
 I was a scavenger who survives
  
 with a sling and stones, but whose god
 nonetheless invents the first small bright bird.
 And it was like flight to bring food to her lips
  
 with a skeletal hand. But now she will always 
 be naked and sad. She will be what happens
  
 to lake water that is loved and is also 
 shallow enough. The thickening, the slowing,
 the black blood of it, the chest opened
 to reveal the inevitable heart attack.
  
 God, the silence of the chamber
 we watch from. What happens to water
 that isn’t loved? It undergoes processes.
  
 It freezes beside traffic. 
 But the reaching out to all sides at once,
 the wet closing of what was open?
 That is a beautiful woman.
  
 So of course I stand and stare, never able
 to pinpoint the exact moment I killed her.

title : Homeland of the Foreign Tongue

Each morning we begin again. My wife 
wakes me with a shove, and condescends to try   
her sorry Deutsch with me; she’s chewing mud.   
God, she’s dumb. I tell her so, but mostly 
in a dialect she never understands. 
Carefully now, she mouths her thanks and takes me 

by the hand to the dampness of the trough,   
where she leaves me throwing water on my face.   
I wash those parts I want to wash, begin   
my bump along the wall to the sour kitchen,   
where coffee waits and something tasteless chills   
against the plate. Grace is blind, and probably 

deaf as well, happens only where angels   
let it—nowhere you’ll ever find in time. 
I’ve never seen the woman’s face, though once, 
too far from here to count for much, I wished I could.   
But it’s morning come again, and she,   
as is her habit, begins to sing above the soup. 

Somewhere, some angel pities me, as God   
must once have pitied her: Her voice forgets   
its tenement, and I neglect the words.

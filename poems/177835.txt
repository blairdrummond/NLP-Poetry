title : Poem For A Lady Whose Voice I Like

author : Nikki Giovanni

text : 
so he said: you ain’t got no talent   
    if you didn’t have a face   
    you wouldn’t be nobody 

and she said: god created heaven and earth   
    and all that’s Black within them 

so he said: you ain’t really no hot shit   
    they tell me plenty sisters   
    take care better business than you 

and she said: on the third day he made chitterlings   
    and all good things to eat   
    and said: “that’s good” 

so he said: if the white folks hadn’t been under   
    yo skirt and been giving you the big play 
    you’d a had to come on uptown like everybody else 

and she replied: then he took a big Black greasy rib 
    from adam and said we will call this woeman and her   
    name will be sapphire and she will divide into four parts   
    that simone may sing a song 

and he said: you pretty full of yourself ain’t chu 

so she replied: show me someone not full of herself   
    and i’ll show you a hungry person

Persona

Robinson at cards at the Algonquin; a thin 
Blue light comes down once more outside the blinds.   
Gray men in overcoats are ghosts blown past the door.   
The taxis streak the avenues with yellow, orange, and red.   
This is Grand Central, Mr. Robinson. 

Robinson on a roof above the Heights; the boats 
Mourn like the lost. Water is slate, far down. 
Through sounds of ice cubes dropped in glass, an osteopath,   
Dressed for the links, describes an old Intourist tour.   
--Here's where old Gibbons jumped from, Robinson. 

Robinson walking in the Park, admiring the elephant.   
Robinson buying the Tribune, Robinson buying the Times. Robinson 
Saying, "Hello. Yes, this is Robinson. Sunday 
At five? I'd love to. Pretty well. And you?" 
Robinson alone at Longchamps, staring at the wall. 

Robinson afraid, drunk, sobbing Robinson 
In bed with a Mrs. Morse. Robinson at home; 
Decisions: Toynbee or luminol? Where the sun 
Shines, Robinson in flowered trunks, eyes toward 
The breakers. Where the night ends, Robinson in East Side bars. 

Robinson in Glen plaid jacket, Scotch-grain shoes,   
Black four-in-hand and oxford button-down, 
The jeweled and silent watch that winds itself, the brief- 
Case, covert topcoat, clothes for spring, all covering   
His sad and usual heart, dry as a winter leaf.

This that is washed with weed and pebblestone   
Curved once a dolphin’s length before the prow,   
And I who read the land to which we bore   
In its grave eyes, question my idol now, 
What cold and marvelous fancy it may keep,   
Since the salt terror swept us from our course,   
Or if a wisdom later than the storm, 
For old green ocean’s tinctured it so deep;   
And with some reason to me on this strand   
The waves, the ceremonial waves have come,   
And stooped their barbaric heads, and all flung out   
Their glittering arms before them, and are gone,   
Leaving the murderous tribute lodged in sand.

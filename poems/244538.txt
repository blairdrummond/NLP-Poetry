In a light chocolatine room
 with blackout windows,
 a loud clock drowns in soft dawn’s
  
 syllables, crisscrossed
 with a broken cloudiness
 I’d choose as my own bedcovers
  
 but cannot. My choice of sleep
 or sky has no music of its own.
 There’s no “its own” while the baby cries.
  
 Oh, the baby cries. He howls and claws
 like a wrongly minor red wolf
 who doesn’t know his mother.
  
 I know I am his mother, but I can’t
 quite click on the word’s essential aspects,
 can’t denude the flora
  
 or disrobe the kind of housecoat
 “mother” always is. Something
 cunty, something used.
  
 Whatever meaning the word itself
 is covering, like underwear,
 that meaning is so mere and meager
  
 this morning. Mother. Baby.
 Chicken and egg. It’s so obnoxious
 of me: I was an egg
  
 who had  an egg
 and now I’m a chicken,
 as usual scooping up
  
 both possibilities,
 or what I used to call
 possibilities. I used
  
 to be this way, so ontologically
 greedy, wanting to be it all.
 Serves me right.
  
 My belief in the fluidity
 of the self turns out to mean
 my me is a flow of wellwater,

                                                    
 without the well, or the bucket,
 a hole dug and seeping.
 A kind of unwell, where
  
 the ground reabsorbs
 what it was displaced to give.
 The drain gives meaning to the sieve.
  
 As I said: a chicken who still
 wants to be all potential.
 Someone who springs
  
 and falls, who cannot see
 how many of us I have 
 in me—and I do not like them all.
  
 Do I like us? Can I love us?
 If anyone comes
 first it’s him, but how can that be?
  
 I was here way, way first.
 I have the breasts, godawful, and he
 the lungs and we share the despair.
  
 For we are a we, aren’t we? We split
 a self in such a way that there isn’t
 enough for either of us.
  
 The father of the baby is sleepy
 and present in his way, in the way
 of fathers. He is devoted like
  
 few fathers, and maybe hurts
 like I hurt, like no fathers.
 I don’t know what someone else
  
 feels, not even these someones
 who are also me. Do they hurt
 like I do?  Why can’t they
  
 tell me, or morse or sign: let
 me know they know where and how
 and why it hurts? Or something?
  
 What is the point of other people,
 being so separate, if we can’t 
 help a person get that pain
  
 will stick its shiv into anything,
 just to get rid of the weapon
 and because it can? For if we share
  
 ourselves then they, too, must
 also be in so much pain.
 I can hear it. Oh, my loves.
  
 The wood of the crib, the white
 glow of the milk (which must
 have siphoned off the one
  
 and only pure part of me, leaving
 me with what, toxicity
 or sin or mush?), the awful softness.
  
 I’ve been melted into something
 too easy to spill. I make more
 and more of myself in order
  
 to make more and more of the baby.
 He takes it, this making. And somehow
 he’s made more of me, too.
  
 I’m a mother now.
 I run to the bathroom, run
 to the kitchen, run to the crib
  
 and I’m not even running.
 These places just scare up as needed,
 the wires that move my hands
  
 to the sink, to the baby,
 to the breast are electrical.
 I’m in shock.
  
 One must be in shock to say so,
 as if one’s own state is assessable,
 like a car accident or Minnesota taxes.
  
 A total disaster, this sack of liquid
 flesh which yowls and leaks
 and I’m talking about me
  
 not the baby. Me, this puddle
 of a middle, this utilized vessel,
 cracked hull, divine
  
 design. It’s how it works. It’s how
 we all got here. Deform
 following the function . . .
  
 But what about me? I whisper
 secretly and to think,
 around these parts used to be
  
 the joyful place of sex,
 what is now this intimate
 terror and squalor.
  
 My eyes burned out at three a.m. and again
 at six and eleven. This is why the clock
 is drowning, as I said earlier.
  
 I’m trying to explain it.
 I repeat myself, or haven’t I already?
 Tiny self, along with a tiny self.
  
 I’ll say it: he hurt me, this new
 babe, then and now.
 Perhaps he always will,
  
 though thoughts of the future
 seem like science fiction novels
 I never finished reading.
  
 Their ends like red nerves
 chopped off by cleaver, not aliens,
 this very moment, saving nothing for later.
  
 He howls with such fury and clarity
 I must believe him.
 No god has the power
  
 to make me believe anything,
 yet I happen to know
 this baby knows a way out.
  
 This dark hole closing in on me
 all around: he’ll show me
 how to get through
  
 the shock and the godlessness
 and the rictus of crushed flesh,
 into the rest of my life.

title : Tyranny of Moths

author : Gerald Vizenor

text : 
feathery moths
flutter on the screen
unbearable
sounds of summer

oblivious tonight
that my reading light
is not my day

stout bodies 
cut and bounce
near a crack
in the screen
and beat inside
a paper shade
sacraments
of a monumental
natural presence

we are drawn 
forever
by the moths
to other lights
neighbors
down the road

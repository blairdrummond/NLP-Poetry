title : Hands Are Wood

author : Seth Abramson

Come see the woodpile behind the cannery. 
Come through the wall 
            to where the wood was chopped 
and the difficult wood was hewed. 
There is a short history of commotion here, 
where a sudden bonfire spat its surprise 
            at the sky— 

a hundred feet or more the shavings swept 
through disturbed air, and made their own 
music, the music hands make, such a yellow 
crackle and such a thrashing 

in the morning. 
Come wait for the heavy trucks to arrive, 
            the men in dusters cutting the twine, 
loading the long ghostly planks like ballast 
            into iron barges. 

This will be packing for a transatlantic box, 
or paper for essays on schadenfreude, or timber 
for dollhouse dressers, or a twenty baht note 
for the Thai rubber trade. These matchsticks 

will burn whenever you strike them, and this, 
hack at it however you like, is nothing more 
than deadwood for the fire. Come see—now 
even the men are doing only 
                        what they were made to do.

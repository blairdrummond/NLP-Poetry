Poems for Weddings



The world's as the world is; the nations rearm and prepare to change; the age of tyrants returns; 
The greatest civilization that has ever existed builds itself higher towers on breaking foundations. 
Recurrent episodes; they were determined when the ape's children first ran in packs, chipped flint to an edge. 

I lie and hear dark rain beat the roof, and the blind wind. 

                                                                                       In the morning 
   perhaps I shall find strength again 
To value the immense beauty of this time of the world, the flowers of decay their pitiful loveliness, the fever-dream 
Tapestries that back the drama and are called the future. This ebb of vitality feels the ignoble and cruel 
Incidents, not the vast abstract order. 

                                                          I lie and hear dark rain beat the roof, and the night-blind wind. 

In the Ventana country darkness and rain and the roar of waters fill the deep mountain-throats. 
The creekside shelf of sand where we lay last August under a slip of stars 
And firelight played on the leaning gorge-walls, is drowned and lost. The deer of the country huddle on a ridge 
In a close herd under madrone-trees; they tremble when a rock-slide goes down, they open great darkness- 
Drinking eyes and press closer. 

                                              Cataracts of rock 
Rain down the mountain from cliff to cliff and torment the stream-bed. The stream deals with them. The laurels are wounded, 
Redwoods go down with their earth and lie thwart the gorge. I hear the torrent boulders battering each other, 
I feel the flesh of the mountain move on its bones in the wet darkness. 

                                                                                  Is this more beautiful 
Than man's disasters? These wounds will heal in their time; so will humanity's. This is more beautiful....at night....

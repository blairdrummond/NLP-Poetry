title : What To Do

author : W. S. Di Piero

text : 
Places we leave 
slick our bodies 
with silky air   
or foam we feel 
faithful and tickly 
(even somehow taste) 
but can't clearly see. 
We wear its weight 
like atmosphere— 
runs, blots 
of what we've done   
in and with   
each place   
—what to do 
with it now?— 
and what it does 
to us still.

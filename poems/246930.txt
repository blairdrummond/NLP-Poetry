title : Awash

author : Brian Russell

text : 
the unthinkable prospect 
of a world in which I am left 
to my own devices

which are few and as soon 
as the batteries die useless 
first order of business

I draw a map in the sand
mark where I stand as the capital
of civilization   within me the
detailed blueprints of the pyramids
and the concept of zero
beyond me the finite frontier

the many miles of undeveloped 
shoreline with spectacular views of a 
sea filled with intricately depicted 
monsters   I have a lot to do before

I introduce the new world 
to art and astronomy and industry 
medicine and technology 
ethics politics democracy

by a show of hands we shall elect 
which tree to burn in the first fire

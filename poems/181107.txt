text : 
What you cannot see through those windows 
beyond the bare hill 
is the hand resting on the table, 
is the man lying still 
on the bed, is the vague gesture 
of  the young woman in the hallway 
as she remembers something that happened yesterday, 
is the mouse hesitating under the draining board, 
is the twelve year old boy putting on a record 
of  Wiener Blut that he once saw 
his parents waltzing to. 

All that you see is the all-but-naked child 
on the all-but-naked hill against a naked sky, 
as if  what you could not see were the question 
and she the reply.

title : Prais’d be Diana’s Fair and Harmless Light

author : Sir Walter Ralegh

text : 
Prais’d be Diana’s fair and harmless light; 
Prais’d be the dews wherewith she moists the ground; 
Prais’d be her beams, the glory of the night; 
Prais’d be her power by which all powers abound. 

Prais’d be her nymphs with whom she decks the woods, 
Prais’d be her knights in whom true honour lives; 
Prais’d be that force by which she moves the floods; 
Let that Diana shine which all these gives. 

In heaven queen she is among the spheres; 
In aye she mistress-like makes all things pure; 
Eternity in her oft change she bears; 
She beauty is; by her the fair endure. 

Time wears her not: she doth his chariot guide; 
Mortality below her orb is plac’d; 
By her the virtue of the stars down slide; 
In her is virtue’s perfect image cast. 

         A knowledge pure it is her worth to know: 
         With Circes let them dwell that think not so.

title : A Kind of Villanelle

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
I will have been walking away: 
no matter what direction I intended, 
at that moment, I will have been walking 

Away into the direction that you now say 
I have always intended, no matter what my 
intention was then, I will have been 

Walking away, though it will not be clear 
what it was that I was leaving or 
even why, it seems that you will say 

That always, I was walking away, 
intending a direction that was not towards 
you, but moving away with every step, 

Or, even when I pretended to be walking 
towards you, only making the place 
for my feet to go backwards, 

Away, where I will have been walking, 
always away:   intention and direction 
unknown, but knowing you will always 
say I will have been walking away.

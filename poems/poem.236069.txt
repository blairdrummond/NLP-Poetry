Sonnet

Far, far out lie the white sails all at rest; 
Like spectral arms they seem to touch and cling 
Unto the wide horizon. Not a wing 
Of truant bird glides down the purpling west; 
No breeze dares to intrude, e'en on a quest 
To fan a lover's brow; the waves to sing 
Have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling 
A bow across its vibrant chords. Then, lest 
One moment of the sea's repose we lose, 
Nor furnish Fancy with a thousand themes 
Of unimagined sweetness, let us gaze 
On this serenity, for as we muse, 
Lo! all is restless motion: life's best dreams 
Give changing moods to even halcyon days.

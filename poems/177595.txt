My father has a pair of shoes 
So beautiful to see. 
I want to wear my father's shoes. 
They are too big for me. 

My baby brother has a pair 
As cunning as can be. 
My feet won't go into that pair. 
They are too small for me. 

There's only one thing that I can do 
Till I get small or grown. 
If I want to have some fitting shoes 
I'll have to wear my own.

title : The One-Year-Old Lemon Tree

author : W. S. Di Piero

text : 
Its small celestial reach stops 
       where the counterweight, the first 
             tough green fruit, pulls earthward   
and returns the brazen, almost rank perfume   
of blossoms now six months gone. 

The slurred odor of its leaves 
       calls back that long evening’s end: 
             we shivered in the cool light   
a northerly sun bent against the world   
into the hands of friends 

who helped clear the outdoor supper’s 
       sharp debris—forks, tin plates, 
             balled napkins and bone nests.   
The lemon blossoms throbbed. The air   
slowed with so much young life, 

the fragrance quickened in our veins 
       the common, too surprising wish 
             to hold, just then, another,   
whoever stood nearest, whatever charm   
would bind us to the lowering light. 

Then someone said, “Let’s eat the tree”— 
       Tear apart the bole, raid the green heart, 
             devour remembrance with one moment’s   
hunger and eat the nature of things. 
Scraped plates, laughter, glasses refilled . . .

Our sweet anger urged and gathered us 
       around the young tree’s tub, made us 
             tamp the wet soil and drink fast   
the clear smell of unseen yellow fruit   
in time we ourselves might never know.

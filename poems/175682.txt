title : Myth of the Blaze

text : 
night – sky         bird’s         world 
to know         to know         in my life to know 

what I have said to myself 

the dark to escape in brilliant highways   
of the night sky, finally   
why had they not 

killed me why did they fire that warning   
wounding cannon only the one round I hold a 
          superstition 

because of this    lost to be lost    Wyatt’s   
lyric and Rezi’s 
running thru my mind 
in the destroyed (and guilty) Theatre 
of the War    I’d cried 
and remembered 
boyhood    degradation         other 
degradations and this crime I will not recover   
from that landscape it will be in my mind   
it will fill my mind and this is horrible 
death bed         pavement         the secret taste 
of being lost 

dead 

clown in the birds’   
world what names   
(but my name)

and my love’s name to speak 

into the eyes 
of the Tyger         blaze 

of changes . . . ‘named   

the animals’         name 

and name the vigorous dusty strong 

animals gather 
under the joists   the boards   older 

than they   giving   
them darkness the gifted 

dark tho names   the names   the ‘little’ 

adventurous 
words   a mountain   the cliff 

a wave are taxonomy I believe   

in the world 

because it is 
impossible         the shack 

on the coast 

under the eaves 
the rain barrel flooding 

in the weather and no lights 
across rough water illumined   
as tho the narrow 

end of the funnel what are the names   
of the Tyger   to speak   
to the eyes 

of the Tiger   blaze 
of the tiger   who moves in the forest leaving 

no scent 

but the pine needles’ his eyes blink 

quick 
in         the shack   
in the knife-cut 
and the opaque 

white 

bread each side of the knife

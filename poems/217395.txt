title : Autumn Sky

author : Charles Simic

text : 
In my great grandmother's time,   
All one needed was a broom   
To get to see places   
And give the geese a chase in the sky.   

               • 

The stars know everything,   
So we try to read their minds.   
As distant as they are,   
We choose to whisper in their presence.   

               • 

Oh Cynthia,   
Take a clock that has lost its hands   
For a ride.   
Get me a room at Hotel Eternity   
Where Time likes to stop now and then.   

               • 

Come, lovers of dark corners,   
The sky says,   
And sit in one of my dark corners.   
There are tasty little zeroes   
In the peanut dish tonight.

text : 
I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air.
 I am blind. I am unable to understand the dark
 passages. I begin to speak of being deprived.
 I believe that I am being kept in want. Who
 governs me? Who is to say what I am,
 and what I am not? I wish to be conscious
 of myself. My frontiers are long and insecure.
 I contract them. I cannot command them.
 I determine myself not to desire what is
 unattainable. I have a wound in my leg.
 I am a schoolboy. A rule does not oppress me
 if I impose it on myself. I assimilate it
 into my substance. I can never be thwarted.
 I cannot want it to be other than it is.

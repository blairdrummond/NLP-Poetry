text : 
Aunt Mildred tied up her petticoats with binder’s   
twine, and my great-uncle Ezekiel waxed and waxed   
his moustaches into flexibility. It was the whole   
family off then into the dangerous continent of air 

and while the salesman with the one gold eyetooth told us   
the cords at our ankles were guaranteed to stretch 
to their utmost and then bring us safely back 
to the fried chicken and scalloped potatoes of Sunday dinner 

nobody quite believed. Edwina, my father’s half sister 
by my grandfather’s marriage to a former dance hall girl,   
who got her doctorate in tensor evaluation, she said   
whole galaxies have been known to belch and disappear 

taking with them the King Charles spaniels and the gold- 
plated fire hydrants from where the fire finally stopped   
in the earthquake year. But it was no good growing   
roots into the vegetable garden, not after the Monarch 

butterflies flew up into one whirling vortex and blanked   
out of immediate space, it was no good 
hoping Ken and Barbie, sexless, would anchor us   
to our interchangeable faces, or that our feet 

those flat independent anemones, could grip forever.   
The salesman smiled, with his face the size 
of the Empire State and growing bigger and bigger   
and into and through the face Aunt Mildred went 

shouting “Banzai!” into Great-Uncle Ezekiel’s   
inherited ear trumpet, shredding it to tin ribbons,   
and Edwina, dressed in the full commencement robes   
of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and 

Mother and Father wrapped in each other’s   
reminiscences, and the goldfish, and finally I went   
too, out of the mold my body had been formed in 
and inhabited, as if place were the only realization of person 

and either the cords snapped, as any sceptic might have expected,   
or they are stretched out finer than a human hair, 
that keeps growing after death, even in the black melting   
that may or may not be the tight coral beach beyond.

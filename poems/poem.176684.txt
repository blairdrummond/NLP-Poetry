Free Verse

There are never any suicides in the quarter among people one knows 
No successful suicides. 
A Chinese boy kills himself and is dead. 
(they continue to place his mail in the letter rack at the Dome) 
A Norwegian boy kills himself and is dead. 
(no one knows where the other Norwegian boy has gone) 
They find a model dead 
alone in bed and very dead. 
(it made almost unbearable trouble for the concierge) 
Sweet oil, the white of eggs, mustard and water, soap suds 
and stomach pumps rescue the people one knows. 
Every afternoon the people one knows can be found at the cafe.

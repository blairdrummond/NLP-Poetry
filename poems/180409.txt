title : I Will Not Save the World

author : Jerome Rothenberg

text : 
I like to cross 
these borders. They take place 
between the dead & dead. 
I make my mind up 
to be honest 
only I fail to meet 
their expectations. 
I will not save the world. 
The power in my blood 
runs through my shoe. 
I have never known fatigue 
but know it now. I whistle 
& the dog sits still 
& ponders. 
Nobody else is resting 
or in love. 
The taste of death is in my mouth. 
I suck it like an arm 
until it breaks me. 
It is the fate of animals 
& birds 
the small lives left behind. 
The children in the woods 
run by like children. 
I hide under a blanket 
sick with counting. 
Two & two are five 
but two times two 
is always four. 
Call me tomorrow 
—says the voice— 
& I will call you back. 
I am a net for all 
voracious fish                           (E. Södergran) 
& long for hell.

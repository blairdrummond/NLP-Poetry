title : In the Event of Change

text : 
I am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges.

I am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the 
morning sun.

The context of my story changes when you enter. Then I am dung
on the wall of the nomad’﻿s field. Then the everyday waking person.

I am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
Seeing in your manner.

I am speaking your pace. Slippage of silk slippers.

I say you are losing sight. I say your breasts are dry shells.

I am afraid of what I am capable of doing.

This is all a manner of stating how I prepare myself to be loved.﻿

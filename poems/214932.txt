I cradled my newborn daughter 
and felt the heartbeat   
pull me out of shock.   
She didn’t know 
what her hands were: 
she folded them. I asked her 
was there a place 
where there was no world. 
She didn’t know 
what a voice was: her lips   
were the shape of a nipple.

In the park the child says: 
watch me. It will not count 
unless you see. And she shows me 
the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble, 
the tricks performed at leisure in midair,   
each unknown until it is finished. 
At home she orders: 
see me eat. I watch her 
curl on herself, sleep; 
as I try to leave the dark room 
her dreaming voice commands me: watch.

Always we passed the seesaw   
on the way to the swings   
but tonight I remember   
the principle of the lever,   
I sit the child at one end,   
I sit near the center, 
the fulcrum, at once she has power 
to lift me off the earth   
and keep me suspended 
by her tiny weight, she laughing, 
I stunned at the power of the formula.

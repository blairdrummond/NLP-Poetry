title : cutting greens

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
curling them around
i hold their bodies in obscene embrace
 thinking of everything but kinship.
 collards and kale
 strain against each strange other
 away from my kissmaking hand and
 the iron bedpot.
 the pot is black,
the cutting board is black,
 my hand,
 and just for a minute
 the greens roll black under the knife,
 and the kitchen twists dark on its spine
 and I taste in my natural appetite
 the bond of live things everywhere.

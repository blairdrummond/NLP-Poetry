For once, I felt wanted, dead or alive, 
the day my fame outgrew the Famous Five. 

There came a time I could give no more 
to the other guys in the Gang of Four 

and I felt the dead weight fall from me 
when I unyoked the clowns of the Crucial Three. 

I considered all this as I boarded the bus 
to quit the town not big enough for both of us. 

One eye didnâ€™t seem so much to leave behind 
as I sped to my job in the kingdom of the blind.

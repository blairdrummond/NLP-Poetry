title : Dinner at George & Katie Schneeman’s

author : Ted Berrigan

She was pretty swacked by the time she
 Put the spaghetti & meatballs into the orgy pasta
         bowl—There was mixed salt & pepper in the
 “Tittie-tweak” pasta bowl—We drank some dago red
         from glazed girlie demi-tasse cups—after
 which we engaged in heterosexual intercourse, mutual
         masturbation, fellatio, & cunnilingus. For
 dessert we stared at a cupboard full of art critic
         friends, sgraffitoed into underglazes on vases. We did
 have a very nice time.

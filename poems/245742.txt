We are descending again in parallel—
 I cannot say together—as in another dream
  
 you rushed through the first door
 without me. It was late. Your name
  
 was an elevator door resisting its rail,
 its screech my only attempt to reach you.
  
 Was it the hurt that filled the elevator
 I entered with gurneys and gowned girls,
  
 incubated hearts pumping for a home?
 Floors flicker as they fall.
  
 The girls’ chatter flaps shrill at light,
 tangles in my hair and away
  
 like spring, like spring—
             When the doors open
  
 you will be on the other side, waiting,
 mistaking my elation for rage.

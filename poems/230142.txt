I heard a child, a little under four years old, when asked what was meant by being in good spirits, answer, “It is laughing, talking, and kissing.”  —CHARLES DARWIN, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals
1.   WALDORF-ASTORIA EUPHORIA, 
THE JOY OF BIG CITIES 

       Joy, when intense, leads to various purposeless   
       movements—to dancing about, clapping the   
       hands, stamping, etc.         —IBID. 

You feel so good, you stop walking: 
they swirl around you, racing the 6:15. 
You bless them all with a smile 
you cannot explain: they are suddenly 
precious. You look around, with your alien eyes,   
at forty floors of windows where 
they are laughing, talking, and kissing: you realize   
they are priceless. You feel them 
under the pavement, riding the uptown express,   
straphanging bodies waving 
like kelp, and you know 
they are irreplaceable; you think of them   
all over town, bursting 
with unused happiness, and you clap, 
and clap again, and clapping, you sing 
a song you thought you’d forgotten, and your waist 
moves gently, like jonquils, and your hand   
catches her fingertips, and she smiles, her arms   
moving like willows, 
and the fruitseller dances with apples,   
crying a musical language, and a girl   
with a bongo comes on with rhythm,   
her hips moving like wheatfields, and 
the hardhats come up from the manholes,   
their bodies moving like jackhammers,   
and Chinese voices like windchimes   
sing to the women from San Juan 
who gather around like palm trees, and the cops   
have cordoned the street and are dancing   
with women from Minnesota, 
their thighs as seductive as seaweed;   
and you know that sooner or later 
this had to happen: that somehow 
it would all break out, all that pent-up 
joy, and people would sing and hold hands,   
their bodies swerving like taxis, 
and the music inside their heads 
would fill the streets with dancing, 
clapping hands, and stamping; 
and you sing another chorus 
of we, 
hey, we, 
yes, we, 
I said we 
are all 
we’ve got. 

2.   HUNKYDORIA EUPHORIA, 
THE JOY OF HAVING IT MADE 

       From the excitement of pleasure, the circulation   
       becomes more rapid, the eyes are bright, and   
       the colour of the face rises.                —IBID. 

You’re sweating it out: the last time 
it was never received; 
it was lost in the files; sent   
to the wrong department. 
If you get there by noon, surely 
it will be all right; but the seconds 
are deadly. At ten to twelve 
You reach the office, and of course 
there’s a line. 
You inch along; at noon you touch 
mahogany, and just as you feared, there is 
some difficulty, a shuffling   
of papers: you feel 
the invisible stars 
swing through their long   
cold journey. Finally— 
you can hardly believe it— 
it’s there! the very thing! the thing itself! 
and the holy rubber stamp   
falls like a benediction, 
and you hear, above the ceiling, 
the seraphim rejoicing,   
and you smooth your hair 
and borrow a debonair manner 
and step through the frosted door 
so deliberately, 
no one would ever guess 
that right there under your shirt 
the sun is dancing on water.

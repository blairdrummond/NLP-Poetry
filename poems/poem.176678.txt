Rhymed Stanza

(Lines on the loss of the "Titanic")
I 
            In a solitude of the sea 
            Deep from human vanity, 
And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she. 

II 
            Steel chambers, late the pyres 
            Of her salamandrine fires, 
Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres. 

III 
            Over the mirrors meant 
            To glass the opulent 
The sea-worm crawls -- grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent. 

IV 
            Jewels in joy designed 
            To ravish the sensuous mind 
Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind. 

V 
            Dim moon-eyed fishes near 
            Gaze at the gilded gear 
And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?" ... 

VI 
            Well: while was fashioning 
            This creature of cleaving wing, 
The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything 

VII 
            Prepared a sinister mate 
            For her -- so gaily great -- 
A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate. 

VIII 
            And as the smart ship grew 
            In stature, grace, and hue, 
In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too. 

IX 
            Alien they seemed to be; 
            No mortal eye could see 
The intimate welding of their later history, 

X 
            Or sign that they were bent 
            By paths coincident 
On being anon twin halves of one august event, 

XI 
            Till the Spinner of the Years 
            Said "Now!" And each one hears, 
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.

title : Glad

In the glory of the gloaming-green soccer 
field her team, the Gladiators, is losing 

ten to zip. She never loses interest in 
the roughhouse one-on-one that comes 

every half a minute. She sticks her leg 
in danger and comes out the other side running. 

Later a clump of opponents on the street is chant- 
ing, WE WON, WE WON, WE . . . She stands up 

on the convertible seat holding to the wind-   
shield. WE LOST, WE LOST BIGTIME, TEN TO 

NOTHING, WE LOST, WE LOST. Fist pumping 
air. The other team quiet, abashed, chastened. 

Good losers don't laugh last; they laugh 
continuously, all the way home so glad.

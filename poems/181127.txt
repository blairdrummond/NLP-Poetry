for Gabriele Mintz
As Billy goes higher all the balloons 
Get marooned on the other side of the 
Lunar landscape. The module’s broke— 
It seems like for an eternity, but who’s 
Counting—and Sally’s joined the Moonies 
So we don’t see so much of her anyhow. 
Notorious novelty—I’d settle for a good 
Cup of Chase & Sand-borne—though when 
The strings are broken on the guitar 
You can always use it as a coffee table. 
Vienna was cold at that time of year. 
The sachertorte tasted sweet but the memory 
burned in the colon. Get a grip, get a grip, before 
The Grippe gets you. Glad to see the picture 
Of ink—the pitcher that pours before 
Throwing the Ball, with never a catcher in sight. 
Never a catcher but sometimes a catch, or 
A clinch or a clutch or a spoon—never a 
Catcher but plenty o’flack, ’till we meet 
On this side of the tune.

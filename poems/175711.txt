title : Let Evening Come

author : Jane Kenyon

text : 
Let the light of late afternoon 
shine through chinks in the barn, moving   
up the bales as the sun moves down. 

Let the cricket take up chafing   
as a woman takes up her needles   
and her yarn. Let evening come. 

Let dew collect on the hoe abandoned   
in long grass. Let the stars appear 
and the moon disclose her silver horn. 

Let the fox go back to its sandy den.   
Let the wind die down. Let the shed   
go black inside. Let evening come. 

To the bottle in the ditch, to the scoop   
in the oats, to air in the lung   
let evening come. 

Let it come, as it will, and don’t   
be afraid. God does not leave us   
comfortless, so let evening come.

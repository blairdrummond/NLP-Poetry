The irritations of comfort—
 I visit as they rebuild the house
 from within: whitening, straightening,
 bracing the chimney-breast edges
 and forcing warmth, dryness
 and windows with views into
 the cottage below canal-level.
  
 For yes, there’s a canal, bringing
 cold reflections almost to the door,
 and beyond it the main line to Manchester,
 its grid of gantries pale
 against the upland and the sky;
 there’s a towpath pub, where the red-
 haired old landlady
 brings up the beer from the cellar slowly
 in a jug: there’s a chapel
 next door to the cottage, set up
 with a false front and a real
 boiler-house, and—
 rest, my mind—nearby there’s
 a small haulage contractor’s yard.
  
 Everything’s turned up here, except
 a certain complete cast-iron
 housefront, preserved and pinned
 to a blank wall in Ottawa.
  
 This comfort
 beckons. It won’t do. It beckons.
 Driving steadily through rain in
 a watertight car with the wipers going.
 It won’t do. It beckons.

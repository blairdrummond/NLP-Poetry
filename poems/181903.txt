title : Great As You Are

author : Susan Griffin

text : 
Be like a bear in the forest of yourself. 
Even sleeping you are powerful in your breath. 
Every hair has life 
and standing, as you do, swaying 
from one foot to the other 
all the forest stands with you. 
Each minute sound, one after another, 
is distinct in your ear. Here 
in the blur of mixed sensations, you can 
feel the crisp outline of being, particulate. 
Great as you are, huge as you are and 
growling like the deepest drum, 
the continual vibration that makes music 
what it is, 
not some light stone skipped on the surface of things, 
you travel below 
sounding the depths where only the dauntless go. 
Be like the bear and 
do not forget 
how you rounded your 
massive shape over the just ripened 
berry which burst 
in your mouth that moment 
how you rolled in 
the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling 
with your sensate skin, 
how you shut 
your eyes and swam far and farther 
still, starlight 
shaping itself to your body, 
starship rocking the grand, slow waves 
under the white trees, in the 
snowy night.

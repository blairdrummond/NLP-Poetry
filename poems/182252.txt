title : The Invisible Birds of Central America

For Alicia
The bird who creaks like a rusty playground swing 
the bird who sharpens the knife         the bird who blows 
on the mouths of milk bottles         the bird who bawls like a cat 
like a cartoon baby         the bird who rubs the wineglass 
the bird who curlicues         the bird who quacks like a duck 
but is not a duck         the bird who pinks on a jeweller's hammer 
They hide behind the sunlight scattered throughout the canopy 
At the thud of your feet they fall thoughtful and quiet 
coming to life again only when you have passed 
Perhaps they are not multiple         but one 
a many-mooded trickster         whose voice is rich 
and infinitely various         whose feathers 
liquify the rainbow         rippling scarlet 
emerald indigo         whose streaming tail 
is rare as a comet's         a single glimpse of which 
is all that you could wish for         the one thing 
missing         to make your eyes at last feel full 
to meet this wild need of yours         for wonder

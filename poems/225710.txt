Overhead, the match burns out, 
but the chunk of ice in the back seat 
keeps melting from imagined heat, 
while the old Hudson tiptoes up the slope.   
My voile blouse, so wet it is transparent,   
like one frightened hand, clutches my chest. 
The bag of rock salt sprawled beside me wakes, thirsty   
and stretches a shaky tongue toward the ice. 

I press the gas pedal hard. 
I’ll get back to the house, the dirt yard, the cesspool,   
to you out back, digging a well 
you could fill with your sweat, 
though there is not one reason I should want to.   
You never notice me until the end of the day,   
when your hand is on my knee 
and the ice cream, cooked to broth, 
is hot enough to burn the skin off my touch.

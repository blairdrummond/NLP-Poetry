title : Charlie Howard’s Descent

author : Mark Doty

text : 
Between the bridge and the river
 he falls through
 a huge portion of night;
 it is not as if falling

 is something new. Over and over
 he slipped into the gulf
 between what he knew and how
 he was known. What others wanted

 opened like an abyss: the laughing
 stock-clerks at the grocery, women
 at the luncheonette amused by his gestures.
 What could he do, live

 with one hand tied
 behind his back? So he began to fall
 into the star-faced section
 of night between the trestle

 and the water because he could not meet
 a little town’s demands,
 and his earrings shone and his wrists
 were as limp as they were.

 I imagine he took the insults in
 and made of them a place to live;
 we learn to use the names
 because they are there,

 familiar furniture: faggot
 was the bed he slept in, hard
 and white, but simple somehow,
 queer something sharp

 but finally useful, a tool,
 all the jokes a chair,
 stiff-backed to keep the spine straight,
 a table, a lamp. And because

 he’s fallen for twenty-three years,
 despite whatever awkwardness
 his flailing arms and legs assume
 he is beautiful

 and like any good diver
 has only an edge of fear
 he transforms into grace.
 Or else he is not afraid,

 and in this way climbs back
 up the ladder of his fall,
 out of the river into the arms
 of the three teenage boys

who hurled him from the edge—
 really boys now, afraid,
 their fathers’ cars shivering behind them,
 headlights on—and tells them

 it’s all right, that he knows
 they didn’t believe him
 when he said he couldn’t swim,
 and blesses his killers

 in the way that only the dead
 can afford to forgive.

title : The Marriage in the Trees

When the wind was right everything else 
was wrong, like the oak we thought built 
better than the house split like a ship 
on a rock. We let it stand the winter, 
spectral, shagged, every sky its snow, 
then cut it down, dismantled it in 
pieces like disease. Then limbs from 
the yellow poplar broke at will— 
fell from the heights like bones 
of the Puritans; even to gather them 
in bundles seemed puritanical. 
And the willow, by its nature, wept 
long tears of its overbranching, 
so pale they were autumnal. These 
we turned too easily to switches, 
mocking the bickering in the spruce's 
nesting eaves, which crows, then jays 
bothered all they could. The list, 
the list. The sycamore made maps 
of disappearance; the copper beech, 
parental in its girth, was clipped 
hard, by a car, with a wound that wouldn't 
heal. Doctoring, then witchery, then 
love—nothing we tried would work. 
More apple trees that grew nowhere 
but down. More maples spilling sugar. 
More hawthorns blazing out, telling truth.

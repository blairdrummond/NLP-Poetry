Rhymed Stanza

The evening darkens over 
After a day so bright 
The windcapt waves discover 
That wild will be the night. 
There's sound of distant thunder. 

The latest sea-birds hover 
Along the cliff's sheer height; 
As in the memory wander 
Last flutterings of delight, 
White wings lost on the white. 

There's not a ship in sight; 
And as the sun goes under 
Thick clouds conspire to cover 
The moon that should rise yonder. 
Thou art alone, fond lover.

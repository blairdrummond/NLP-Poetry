title : Fork

author : Charles Simic

text : 
This strange thing must have crept   
Right out of hell. 
It resembles a bird’s foot 
Worn around the cannibal’s neck. 

As you hold it in your hand, 
As you stab with it into a piece of meat, 
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:   
Its head which like your fist 
Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.

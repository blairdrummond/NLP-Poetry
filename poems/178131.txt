title : Respublica

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
The strident high   
civic trumpeting   
of misrule. It is 
what we stand for. 

Wild insolence,   
aggregates without   
distinction. Courage   
of common men: 

spent in the ruck   
their remnant witness 
after centuries   
is granted them 

like a pardon. 
And other fealties   
other fortitudes 
broken as named— 

Respublica 
brokenly recalled,   
its archaic laws   
and hymnody; 

and destroyed hope   
that so many times 
is brought with triumph   
back from the dead.

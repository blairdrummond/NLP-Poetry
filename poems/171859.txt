Tonight Hazard’s father and stepmother are having 
jazz for McGovern. In the old game-room 
the old liberals listen as the quintet builds 
crazy houses out of skin and brass, crumbling 
the house of decorum, everybody likes that.

For decades they have paid for the refurbishing
of America and they have not got their money’s worth. 
Now they listen, hopeful,
to the hard rock for McGovern.

The ceiling in this palace needs fixing,
the chalky blue paint is like an old heaven 
but there are holes and flaking.
They had movies here when grandpa was solvent.

Hazard desires his wife, the way people
on the trains to the death camps were seized 
by irrational lust. She is the youngest woman 
in the room, he would like to be in bed 
with her now, he would like to be president.

He has not been to his studio
in four days, he asks the bartender,
a college boy with a ponytail, for more gin. 
He stands in the doorway. Forsythia and lilac 
have overgrown the porch, there is the rich 
smell of wood-rot. What twenty years will do
to untended shrubbery and America and Hazard.

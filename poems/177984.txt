title : Tangerine

author : Ruth L. Schwartz

text : 
It was a flower once, it was one of a billion flowers 
whose perfume broke through closed car windows, 
forced a blessing on their drivers. 
Then what stayed behind grew swollen, as we do; 
grew juice instead of tears, and small hard sour seeds, 
each one bitter, as we are, and filled with possibility. 
Now a hole opens up in its skin, where it was torn from the 
branch; ripeness can’t stop itself, breathes out; 
we can’t stop it either. We breathe in.

title : Five Years Later

author : Tony Gloeggler

text : 
My brother was on his way 
to a dental appointment 
when the second plane hit 
four stories below the office 
where he worked. Heâ€™s never 
said anything about the guy 
who took football bets, how 
he liked to watch his secretary 
walk, the friends he ate lunch with, 
all the funerals. Maybe, shamed 
by his luck, he keeps quiet,
afraid someone might guess 
how good he feels, breathing.

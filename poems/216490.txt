title : The Heart's Archaeology

author : Maudelle Driskell

text : 
On some fundless expedition, 
you discover it beneath 
a pyracantha bush 
carved from the hip bone 
of a long-extinct herbivore 
that walked the plains on legs 
a story tall. An ocarina of bone 
drilled and shaped laboriously 
with tools too soft to be efficient 
by one primitive musician 
spending night after night 
squatting by the fire. 
No instrument of percussion: 
place this against your lips, 
fill it from your lungs to sound 
a note winding double helix, solo 
and thready calling to the pack.

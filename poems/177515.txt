title : Eden, Then and Now

In â€™29 before the dust storms 
sandblasted Indianapolis, 
we believed in the milk company. 
Milk came in glass bottles. 
We spread dye-colored butter, 
now connected to cancer. 
We worked seven to seven 
with no overtime pay; 
pledged allegiance every day, 
pitied the starving Armenians. 
One morning in the midst of plenty, 
there were folks out of context, 
who were living on nothing. 
Some slept in shacks 
on the banks of the river. 
This phenomenon investors said 
would pass away. 
My father worked for the daily paper. 
He was a union printer; 
lead slugs and blue smoke. 
He worked with hot lead 
at a two-ton machine, 
in a low-slung seat; 
a green-billed cap 
pulled low on his forehead. 
He gave my mother a dollar a day. 
You could say we were rich. 
This was the Jazz Age.
All over the country
the dispossessed wandered
with their hungry children,
harassed by the law.
When the market broke, bad losers
jumped out of windows.
It was time to lay an elegant table,
as it is now; corporate paradise; 
the apple before the rot caved in.
It was the same worm
eating the same fruit.
In fact, the same Eden.

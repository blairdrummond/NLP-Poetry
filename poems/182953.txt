title : Night Music

text : 
She sits on the mountain that is her home 
and the landscapes slide away. One goes down 
and then up to the monastery. One drops away 
to a winnowing ring and a farmhouse where a girl 
and her mother are hanging the laundry. 
Thereâ€™s a tiny port in the distance where 
the shore reaches the water. She is numb 
and clear because of the grieving in that world. 
She thinks of the bandits and soldiers who 
return to the places they have destroyed. 
Who plant trees and build walls and play music 
in the village square evening after evening, 
believing the mothers of the boys they killed 
and the women they raped will eventually come 
out of the white houses in their black dresses 
to sit with their children and the old. 
Will listen to the music with unreadable eyes.

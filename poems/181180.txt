Bobby Hutcherson in Oakland
The mallet strikes but something's off, 
and so he hits again, curling that lower lip, 
purses his brow, as if this sign, this minor woe, 
were speech the vibes might understand, 
so when he lifts bluish lids as if wakened 
to the desired tone that rings now, it seems, 
it sounds, under wraps, a water-ly quaver, 
through the club crowd's silence, 
as it floats above us like an aerosol 
trying to find a new way to escape, 
passes through the wall's mortared pores 
to reverb in the cool night air of an 
unpeopled sidewalk, droning toward tracks 
where a passing peopled train sucks up 
and winds his finally found, wowed tone 
around its wheels, held there by steel heat 
one hundred miles, until it reaches the sea, 
where wheels and whistle overreach 
surging surf the good vibration feels such 
desire for, and leaves its tedium 
of the round and round, lofting to a sea 
that comes and goes but finally simply goes, 
as one night, this night, the cool vibes' air 
(struck finally in the changed groove of sax 
and ecstatic kit) is free, finally free, 
to go where we won't hear from it again.

title : The Dancer

author : David Tucker

text : 
Class is over, the teacher 
and the pianist gone, 
but one dancer 
in a pale blue 
leotard stays 
to practice alone without music, 
turning grand jetes 
through the haze of late afternoon. 
Her eyes are focused 
on the balancing point 
no one else sees 
as she spins in this quiet 
made of mirrors and light— 
a blue rose on a nail— 
then stops and lifts 
her arms in an oval pause 
and leans out 
a little more, a little more, 
there, in slow motion 
upon the air.

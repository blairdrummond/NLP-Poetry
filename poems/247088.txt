title : Death Is a Hysterical Dynasty

author : Steve Kistulentz

Tonight we shall read from my personal book of lamentations, 
sit shiva in a room lit with those overly perfumed candles as thick 
as the aluminum bat I used just last week to flip away the possum 
carcass I'd found collapsed against the house. Forensics tells us 
the backyard is Panama before quinine, an ecosystem 
unto itself, civil war of mongoose, snake, and cat. The cause
 of the possum's death was obvious, this near-biblical dryness 
that lasted the summer. This morning I found a carapace, 
a palmetto bug in my shower, dead in his search for water. 
He got flushed, a Viking funeral; minutes later I heard about
 Rocky, 48, complications from a ruptured aortic aneurysm, 
who went the same week as John, 47, though by less violent means. 
I'd never introduced either to my family, and now I am covering 
the mirrors. Pictures from a decade ago exist without context, 
the bars in them closed, marriages shattered on the pebbly coast 
of installment debt, bands broken up by midnight arguments 
dead men can't recall. Forgive us our trespasses, yes, but also 
this literalism. Let us frame the only surviving picture of the three 
of us in a rectangle of thorns before we take communion 
out in the street. I will let those candles burn, burn, burn, 
burn, burn to the wick, Barracuda, then tell you how 
I would have laid down my life for either of those two men, 
and I have nothing to offer now they have done that for me.

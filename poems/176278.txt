Imagining, on a long walk   
between two Greek towns, 
those Turkish prisoners the guidebook   
says were sabred where they crowded   
together on the stone dock;   
and then imagining—still walking,   
anxious to see some worker   
in the fields or another old couple   
like the last one (he riding   
the donkey, she leading it in black)— 
the Greeks whom the Germans shot;   
and as the road after rising   
leads down again, at last to   
the town by the bay, imagining   
all the feuds given license   
by the civil war, the woman   
whose husband, forgive him   
his faults now, steps 
dead through the doorway one night:   
imagining, imagining—is there   
a way out of this brooding ahead   
to the hollow thud of the first   
dirt thrown down on his coffin? 

What is the word any tongue   
can make good for the boy— 
let someone else name his country— 
who speaks to his sleeping wife 
when he leaves at night, 
his brother tagging after him, 
one puny gun between them? 
If his cold spirit can still 
speak her name tomorrow, won’t she feel   
even more alone? 
                        Aeneas carried 
a high purpose on the point of his sword:   
a city needed founding, if not 
here then in another place. 
This road, though, dips past 
two ordinary houses and then the disco   
casting a stale abandoned shade,   
sharp-edged, to one side, and I descend— 
through hot odd-angled streets lined   
with those plane trees whose name’s   
so bland and awkward translated 
out of sunny Greek or Spanish— 
to the huge white plane-tree-shaded square. 

At the cafe in the open air 
I order lemonade from the waitress   
who has just served the little table   
crowded round by seven or eight, 
a changing group—the eager interpreter   
talking and listening at the same time,   
three young women 
dressed up, and even in this small town 
the four military men from the foreign   
ship offshore, out of uniform but   
with an apparent eye for swag   
some future day, talking of 
small deals, clever braveries, travels.   
They exact smiles and attentions   
and never have they seen such   
a pretty town as this, never. 

The three women listen hard 
to the roared harsh sounds of the odd tongue,   
then impatiently to the interpreter 
while the military men wait. 
What could such noise be about? 
Do these men love the ways ours do, 
do they like their women 
to speak to them in bed, to say 
what they want, to say it? 

The Turkish prisoners had been led outside   
with the lie that they’d be freed. 

Inside the smoky small bar so 
they can watch without being watched,   
young men are bitter, imagining 
the weight of medals, coming 
one by one to the dusty window-glass 
then returning toward the far unlit interior.   
The lemonade arrives at last 
in the pretty hands of the waitress, 
she puts it on my white table 
under the plane trees and hurries away   
to be near the laughing group, 
foreign men who one day may bring   
something new to the town, or something old.

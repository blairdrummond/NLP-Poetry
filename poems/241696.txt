title : [Murmurs from the earth of this land﻿]

Murmurs from the earth of this land, from the caves and craters,
        from the bowl of darkness. Down watercourses of our 
        dragon childhood, where we ran barefoot.
 We stand as growing women and men. Murmurs come down
         where water has not run for sixty years.
 Murmurs from the tulip tree and the catalpa, from the ax of
         the stars, from the house on fire, ringing of glass; from
         the abandoned iron-black mill.
 Stars with voices crying like mountain lions over forgotten
         colors.
 Blue directions and a horizon, milky around the cities where the 
         murmurs are deep enough to penetrate deep rock.
 Trapping the lightning-bird, trapping the red central roots.
 You know the murmurs. They come from your own throat.
 You are the bridges to the city and the blazing food-plant green;
 The sun of plants speaks in your voice, and the infinite shells of 
         accretions
 A beach of dream before the smoking mirror.
 You are close to that surf, and the leaves heated by noon, and
         the star-ax, the miner’s glitter walls. The crests of the sea
 Are the same strength you wake with, the darkness is the eyes
         of children forming for a blaze of sight and soon, soon,
 Everywhere, you own silence, who drink from the crater, the 
         nebula, one another, the changes of the soul.

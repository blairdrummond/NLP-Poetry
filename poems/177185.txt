title : from Odes: 30. The Orotava Road

text : 
Four white heifers with sprawling hooves 
         trundle the waggon. 
   Its ill-roped crates heavy with fruit sway.   
The chisel point of the goad, blue and white, 
         glitters ahead, 
   a flame to follow lance-high in a man’s hand   
who does not shave. His linen trousers 
         like him want washing. 
   You can see his baked skin through his shirt.   
He has no shoes and his hat has a hole in it. 
         ‘Hu ! vaca ! Hu ! vaca !’ 
   he says staccato without raising his voice;   
‘Adios caballero’ legato but 
         in the same tone. 
   Camelmen high on muzzled mounts   
boots rattling against the panels   
         of an empty 
   packsaddle do not answer strangers. 
Each with his train of seven or eight tied   
         head to tail they 
   pass silent but for the heavy bells   
and plip of slobber dripping from 
         muzzle to dust; 
   save that on sand their soles squeak slightly.   
Milkmaids, friendly girls between   
         fourteen and twenty 
   or younger, bolt upright on small   
trotting donkeys that bray (they arch their   
         tails a few inches 
   from the root, stretch neck and jaw forward 
to make the windpipe a trumpet) 
         chatter. Jolted 
   cans clatter. The girls’ smiles repeat   
the black silk curve of the wimple   
         under the chin. 
   Their hats are absurd doll’s hats   
or flat-crowned to take a load. 
         All have fine eyes. 
   You can guess their balanced nakedness   
under the cotton gown and thin shift.   
         They sing and laugh. 
   They say ‘Adios!’ shyly but look back   
more than once, knowing our thoughts   
         and sharing our 
   desires and lack of faith in desire.

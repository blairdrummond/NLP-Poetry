text : 
Make me, O Lord, thy Spining Wheele compleate.
       Thy Holy Worde my Distaff make for mee.
Make mine Affections thy Swift Flyers neate
       And make my Soule thy holy Spoole to bee.
       My Conversation make to be thy Reele
       And reele the yarn thereon spun of thy Wheele.

Make me thy Loome then, knit therein this Twine:
       And make thy Holy Spirit, Lord, winde quills:
Then weave the Web thyselfe. The yarn is fine.
       Thine Ordinances make my Fulling Mills.
       Then dy the same in Heavenly Colours Choice,
       All pinkt with Varnisht Flowers of Paradise.

Then cloath therewith mine Understanding, Will,
       Affections, Judgment, Conscience, Memory
My Words, and Actions, that their shine may fill
       My wayes with glory and thee glorify.
       Then mine apparell shall display before yee
       That I am Cloathd in Holy robes for glory.

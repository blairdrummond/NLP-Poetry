title : The Mower

author : Philip Larkin

text : 
The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found   
A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,   
Killed. It had been in the long grass. 

I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.   
Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world   
Unmendably. Burial was no help: 

Next morning I got up and it did not. 
The first day after a death, the new absence   
Is always the same; we should be careful 

Of each other, we should be kind   
While there is still time.

title : The Rescue

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
The man sits in a timelessness   
with the horse under him in time   
to a movement of legs and hooves   
upon a timeless sand. 

Distance comes in from the foreground   
present in the picture as time 
he reads outward from 
and comes from that beginning. 

A wind blows in 
and out and all about the man   
as the horse ran 
and runs to come in time. 

A house is burning in the sand.   
A man and horse are burning.   
The wind is burning. 
They are running to arrive.

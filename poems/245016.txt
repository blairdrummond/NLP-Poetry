Sweet beats of jazz impaled on slivers of wind
 Kansas Black Morning/ First Horn Eyes/
 Historical sound pictures on New Bird wings
 People shouts/ boy alto dreams/ Tomorrow’s
 Gold belled pipe of stops and future Blues Times
 Lurking Hawkins/ shadows of Lester/ realization
 Bronze fingers—brain extensions seeking trapped sounds
 Ghetto thoughts/ bandstand courage/ solo flight
 Nerve-wracked suspicions of newer songs and doubts
 New York alter city/ black tears/ secret disciples
 Hammer horn pounding soul marks on unswinging gates
 Culture gods/ mob sounds/ visions of spikes
 Panic excursions to tribal Jazz wombs and transfusions
 Heroin nights of birth/ and soaring/ over boppy new ground.
 Smothered rage covering pyramids of notes spontaneously exploding
 Cool revelations/ shrill hopes/ beauty speared into greedy ears
 Birdland nights on bop mountains, windy saxophone revolutions.
 Dayrooms of junk/ and melting walls and circling vultures/
 Money cancer/ remembered pain/ terror flights/
 Death and indestructible existence
  
 In that Jazz corner of life
 Wrapped in a mist of sound
 His legacy, our Jazz-tinted dawn
 Wailing his triumphs of oddly begotten dreams
 Inviting the nerveless to feel once more
 That fierce dying of humans consumed
 In raging fires of Love.

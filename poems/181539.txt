title : Self-Portrait at Twenty

author : Gregory Orr

text : 
I stood inside myself 
like a dead tree or a tower. 
I pulled the rope 
of braided hair 
and high above me 
a bell of leaves tolled. 

Because my hand 
stabbed its brother, 
I said: Make it stone. 

Because my tongue 
spoke harshly, I said: 
Make it dust. 
                   And yet 
it was not death, but 
her body in its green dress 
I longed for. That’s why 
I stood for days in the field 
until the grass turned black 
and the rain came.

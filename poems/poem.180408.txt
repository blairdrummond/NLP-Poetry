Stella, think not that I by verse seek fame, 
Who seek, who hope, who love, who live but thee; 
Thine eyes my pride, thy lips my history; 
If thou praise not, all other praise is shame. 
Nor so ambitious am I, as to frame 
A nest for my young praise in laurel tree: 
In truth I sweare, I wish not there should be 
Graved in mine epitaph a Poet's name: 
Nay if I would, could I just title make, 
That any laud to me thereof should grow, 
Without my plumes from others' wings I take. 
For nothing from my wit or will doth flow, 
Since all my words thy beauty doth endite, 
And love doth hold my hand, and makes me write.

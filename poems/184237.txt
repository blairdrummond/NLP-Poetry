title : On the Subject of Doctors

I like to see doctors cough.
What kind of human being 
would grab all your money 
just when you're down? 
I'm not saying they enjoy this: 
"Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, that's it, 
no hope! You might as well 
hand over your wallet." Hell no, 
they'd rather be playing golf 
and swapping jokes about our feet. 

Some of them smoke marijuana 
and are alcoholics, and their moral 
turpitude is famous: who gets to see 
most sex organs in the world? Not 
poets. With the hours they keep 
they need drugs more than anyone. 
Germ city, there's no hope 
looking down those fire-engine throats. 
They're bound to get sick themselves 
sometime; and I happen to be there 
myself in a high fever 
taking my plastic medicine seriously 
with the doctors, who are dying.

Scribe out of work 
At a loss for words 
Not his to begin with, 
The man life passed by 
Stands at the window 
Biding his time 


       2 

Time and again 
And now once more 
I climb these stairs 
Unlock this door— 
No name where I live 
Alone in my lair 
With one bone to pick 
And no time to spare

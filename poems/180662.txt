title : Love Lives Beyond the Tomb

author : John Clare

text : 
Love lives beyond 
The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew— 
               I love the fond, 
The faithful, and the true 

               Love lives in sleep, 
'Tis happiness of healthy dreams 
               Eve’s dews may weep, 
But love delightful seems. 

               'Tis seen in flowers, 
And in the even's pearly dew 
               On earth's green hours, 
And in the heaven's eternal blue. 

               ‘Tis heard in spring 
When light and sunbeams, warm and kind, 
               On angels’ wing 
Bring love and music to the wind. 

               And where is voice, 
So young, so beautiful and sweet 
               As nature’s choice, 
Where Spring and lovers meet? 

               Love lives beyond 
The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew. 
               I love the fond, 
The faithful, young and true.

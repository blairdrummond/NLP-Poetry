title : My Grandmother Plays Emily in Our Town

I
   
 I am asking something gone
 return: at least one night, her face
  
 a girl’s, just twenty, and
 to be married in a month,
  
 holding the dress’s hem to her lips
 as places are called. And I,
  
 come along too late to know her
 trembling, parting the curtain—
  
 let me hear her now
 perched on the ladder, recite
  
 “But Mama, . . .
 am I pretty enough . . . ?”

  
 II
  
 When Emily marries, ladies in hats
 drown out the proper vows
  
 —it’s what the play requires;
 the everyday over the sacred. Even the set
  
 is made of items found in the actors’ garages
 so we always see back to the bones.
  
 Here my grandmother stands at the altar
 with her fictional George
  
 and gossip swells in the pews
 which are rows of folding chairs.
  
  
 III
   
 Among the murmuring departed,
 in the cemetery,
  
 my grandmother takes
 her place at the empty plot.
  
 She’s the newcomer
 who can’t believe she’s dead
  
 if the living roam
 just on the crest of this hill.
  
 My grandmother in white
 poplin dress and hair ribbon
  
 lifts her arms in despair—
 Emily, untouched by the rain.
  
  
 IV
   
 Tomorrow her face will glow
 on the cover of The Shreveport Times—
  
 a gorgeous girl demanding her life.
 “But oh!” she cries in Emily’s voice,
  
 “I can go back there
 and live all those days over again . . .”
  
  
 V
   
 So Emily steps back
 into childhood
  
 though the wiser dead
 have told her don’t—
  
 into her mother’s kitchen,
 her twelfth birthday, a moment
  
 she thought she was happy.
 She watches now
  
 that life: mother speaking
 gruffly, father late to work.
  
 Dead Emily kisses the cheek
 of the classmate playing her mother—
  
 understanding, in that kitchen,
 they’d all been blind:
  
 they never knew those people
 they said they loved.
  
  
 VI
   
 My grandmother maintains
 her grace to the end.
  
 She is the queen of the theater;
 all of Shreveport melts for her smile.
  
 She holds her palms out
 to feel the heavy drops as the curtains close,
  
 though she knows this rain
 is only the sound of rain.

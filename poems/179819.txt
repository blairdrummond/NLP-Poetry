title : One Afternoon [“A woman stepped outside, crumbled...”]

author : Joanie Mackowski

A woman stepped outside, crumbled 
into a loose particulate, and, as the breeze 
blew up from the east, she scattered: her handful 
of heart, volcanic ash, spiraled the highway, 
and five of her teeth slipped between 
her neighbor's breasts; her neighbor 
unbuttoned her blouse to scratch 
at her suddenly red and luminous skin. 
Days passed. Each day the sun distractedly 
drifted from chair to chair; each night the stars, 
old scatterbrains, they commiserated. 
It didn't rain. Strange, the granular woman 
thought to herself: although I encompass 
so much, I accomplish so little. 
Her car sparkled with her hair and bones; 
her garden thrived. She tried to think: 
why did this happen? what had I eaten? 
why was I bothered?—those old hours, 
spotted and exotic lizards, darted 
the gravel, flicking through their colors 
of skin as one flicks channels on a tv. 
She couldn't catch a one. Then, as a flock 
of sparrows converging for the skull 
of an oak, all her twittering dust, 
her brain, bone, and the dangerous shreds 
of her fingers clawed for the sky; 
what an interesting cloud someone said.

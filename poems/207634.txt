title : The Hero

author : John Unterecker

text : 
Mortal and full of praise,
 I watch the enchanted hero busy at his chores:
 desert, tundra,
 prairie restless
 under an easy stride.
  
 Dagger in belt, sword
 slapping thigh, he passes
 from sight, the restored land
 sprung airily
 to green praise.
  
     Arachnid webs entangle life.
     A busyness of thread
     weaves silk into night—
     the long shudder of moonlight,
     a transfixed eye shuddering.
  
     Nothing is so easy as death, I try to say.
  
     But the hard fact of glazed eyes, the boy turned to
         solitude, lies
     face up in the center of all webs, roads
     unwinding stubble.
                                      Whoever is alone
     walks brittle filaments, late
     stars smudged on dawn, a night sky’s frayed
     dawn.
               Dare we evaluate life:
     This hero’s gesture charms eternity?
  
 Someone who paused here once on an ordinary day,
 troubled by the impatience of his calling,
 set up a hasty signpost:
 “Toward…”
  
     Nothing is so scarred
     as this place, shards of parched
     cloth trampled by footprints coiling
     crazed centers.
                              Fresh with spring, light breezes play
     on dust.
                       A whisper of rain. Ropes of skeined thunder
        twist sky.

text : 
Come the marrow-hours when he couldn't sleep, 
the boy river-brinked and chorded. 

Mud-bedded himself here in the root-mesh; bided. 
Sieved our alluvial sounds— 



Perseverating fiddler-crabs pockworking the pluff-mud;   


(perforated) home-bank gurgle and seethe;   


breathing burrow-holes, under-warrens,   
         (pitched) pent-forts, coverts;   


a rabbity heart-hammering amongst the canes;   


bleat of something;   


sleeping Mama grinding (something) with her jaw; 


Daddy rut-graving gravel driving off; 


the desolated train-trestle rust-buckling   —and falling; 


an echo-tolling cast-iron skillet like a gong; 


downrivering      gone      (gone)      gone      (gone); 


Sylvia supper-calling her fish-camp fish with a bell; 


putting her tea kettle! wren-calls on for the crying   
         marsh-wren orphans; 


R.T. tale-telling down by Norton's Store   
         "Where every Story cauls a Grief"; 


Daddy   —nine-eyed, knee-walking—   aisle-weeping at the Bi-Lo; 


Mama mash-sucking sour loquats in the shed; 


ire-salts quartzifying in the dark; 


the caustics;   


the fires;   


far Fever Creek revival-tents hymning and balming; 


bees thrive-gilding the glade; 


hand-strang bottle-oaks (and intricated yardwire-works)   
         clocking and panging; 


Viaduct Forge & Foundry beating time;    


the bait-boys along the dock drum-dunting their buckets;   


vowel-howling over the water;   


the river;   


RIVER.

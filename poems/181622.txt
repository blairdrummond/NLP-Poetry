What came wafting    
down the ditch 
by the marsh grass waving   
opened a hole   
in the day through which,   

like a puff of breath, 
a ghost fountained up 
rising in soft slo-mo, 
lost, desolate, no place 
left to go.   

Dear bloody 
Beirut and its internet cafes 
were still smoking 
from last night's 
"little bombing."   

Such threads, tattered sleeves 
blown all over the street 
from Emporio Armani. 
Husband and wife shot   
dead at the airport checkpoint. 

Where else would this lead? 
The investiture 
of grieving takes all day 
to sweep up in the tidal spillage 
of plate glass. 

What ish my nation, 
asked Captain MacMorris 
between battles. 
But the ditch knows   
just who we are— 

and I see its only water 
on a stealth raid 
of the glimmer 
hidden in the reeds. 
And when I come close, 

little scavenger flashings 
and great claws held out rigidly 
scuttle back into mud holes 
drilling the bank. 
Bending down to look, 

I could smell the corruption's 
gathering, sweetish odor, 
its sonar gone haywire 
driving it to shore. 
What choices are you given,   

what makes you want to swim   
out of your own element? 
The demure little ear-holes 
and intelligent clear eyes, 
the fate from birth sealed   

inside its smile,   
spent flukes and tail   
being gnawed to bone. 
The curt unrevealing stare 
mirroring back my own.

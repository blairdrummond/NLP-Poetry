title : Madrigal in Time of War

author : John Frederick Nims

text : 
Beside the rivers of the midnight town 
Where four-foot couples love and paupers drown,   
Shots of quick hell we took, our final kiss,   
The great and swinging bridge a bower for this. 

Your cheek lay burning in my fingers’ cup;   
Often my lip moved downward and yours up   
Till both adjusted, tightened, locksmith-true:   
The flesh precise, the crazy brain askew. 

Roughly the train with grim and piston knee   
Pounded apart our pleasure, you from me; 
Flare warned and ticket whispered and bell cried.   
Time and the locks of bitter rail divide. 

For ease remember, all that parted lie:   
Men who in camp of shot or doldrum die,   
Who at land’s-end eternal furlough take 

—This for memento as alone you wake.

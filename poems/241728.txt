for Jack Kerouac ﻿
IN LIGHT ROOM IN DARK HELL IN UMBER IN CHROME,
      I sit feeling the swell of the cloud made about by movement
  
                  of arm leg and tongue. In reflections of gold
            light. Tints and flashes of gold and amber spearing
                      and glinting. Blur glass…blue Glass,
  
              black telephone. Matchflame of violet and flesh
                  seen in the clear bright light. It is not night
  
                 and night too. In Hell, there are stars outside.
             And long sounds of cars. Brown shadows on walls
                                        in the light
                            of the room. I sit or stand
  
                  wanting the huge reality of touch and love.
             In the turned room. Remember the long-ago dream
  
           of stuffed animals (owl, fox) in a dark shop. Wanting
              only the purity of clean colors and new shapes
                                      and feelings.
                  I WOULD CRY FOR THEM USELESSLY
  
                    I have ten years left to worship my youth
                       Billy the Kid, Rimbaud, Jean Harlow
   IN DARK HELL IN LIGHT ROOM IN UMBER AND CHROME I
                                                                                             feel the swell of
 smoke the drain and flow of motion of exhaustion, the long sounds of cars
                                                                                                      the brown shadows
 on the wall. I sit or stand. Caught in the net of glints from corner table to 
                                                                                                                        dull plane
 from knob to floor, angles of flat light, daggers of beams. Staring at love’s face.
       The telephone in cataleptic light. Marchflames of blue and red seen in the 
                                                                                                                             clear grain.
 I see myself—ourselves—in Hell without radiance. Reflections that we are.
  
               The long cars make sounds and brown shadows over the wall.
  
                                I am real as you are real whom I speak to.
                    I raise my head, see over the edge of my nose. Look up
  
                     and see that nothing is changed. There is no flash
                             to my eyes. No change to the room.
  
                        Vita Nuova—No! The dead, dead world.
                      The strain of desire is only a heroic gesture.
                        An agony to be so in pain without release
  
                              when love is a word or kiss.

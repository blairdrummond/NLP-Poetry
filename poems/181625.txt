title : The Green Car

author : Landis Everson

text : 
Defend me. I am not capable. 
The river sweeps by three minutes at once 
cleansing me of guilt. But the bear 
crashes through it and breaches my 
innocence. 
He rages and frightens my innocence. 

The psychologist says, "You are the bear. 
You are the river. 
You are the green car 
crossing the bridge. Defend yourself." 

But the green car 
is in a forest I have failed to speak to. 
The green car was never intended 
to drive in that forest, 
not cross a bridge 
that must not exist in a real dream. 
Further, the real dream 
defends itself.

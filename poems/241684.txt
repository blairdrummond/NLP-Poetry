1  THE BURNING
  
 Girl grown woman     fire     mother of fire
 I go to the stone street turning to fire.     Voices
 Go screaming     Fire     to the green glass wall.
 And there where my youth flies blazing into fire
 The     dance     of sane and insane images, noon
 Of seasons and days.     Noontime of my one hour.
  
 Saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
 Among the tall daylight in the city of change.
 The scene has walls     stone     glass     all my gone life
 One wall a web through which the moment walks
 And I am open, and the opened hour
 The world as water-garden     lying behind it.
 In a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
 Forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.
  
 An arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
 Behind the wall I know waterlilies
 Drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
 Skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
 Walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
 Who will not believe a waterlily fire.
 Whatever can happen in a city of stone,
 Whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall.
  
 I walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
 I pass guards, finding the center of my fear
 And you, Dick, endlessly my friend during storm.
  
 The arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
  
  
 2  THE ISLAND
  
 Born of this river and this rock island, I relate
 The changes : I born when the whirling snow
 Rained past the general’s grave and the amiable child
 White past the windows of the house of Gyp the Blood.
 General, gangster, child.     I know in myself the island.
  
 I was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
 Eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
 Among the building of my young childhood, houses;
 I was those changes, the live darknesses
 Of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields 
 Over the river fronting red cliffs across—
 And always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
 Father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks—
 Bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
 From sleeping streams of change in the change city.
 The violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
 Fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
 Snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring.
  
 Whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
 Under the tall compulsion
                                                    of the past
 I see the city
                           change like a man changing
 I love this man 
                                with my lifelong body of love
 I know you
                         among your changes
                                                                   wherever I go
 Hearing the sounds of building
                                                           the syllables of wrecking
 A young girl watching
                                               the man throwing red hot rivets
 Coals in a bucket of change
 How can you love a city that will not stay?
 I love you
                        like a man of life in change.
  
 Leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
 Like today accepted and become one’s self
 I go, I am a city with bridges and tunnels,
 Rock, cloud, ships, voices.     To the man where the river met
 The tracks, now buried deep along the Drive
 Where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
  
 Towers falling.     A dream of towers.
 Necessity of fountains.     And my poor,
 Stirring among our dreams, 
 Poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
 And lives, looking out through my eyes.
 The city the growing body of our hate and love.
 The root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
 A male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
 Male flower heading upstream.
  
 Among a city of light, the stone that grows.
 Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
 Monuments rivetted against flesh.
 Blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
 Stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and I
 See stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
 Lilies of all my life on fire.
 Flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
  
 I walk past the guards into my city of change.
  
  
 3  JOURNEY CHANGES
  
 Many of us     Each in his own life waiting
 Waiting to move     Beginning to move     Walking
 And early on the road of the hill of the world
 Come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
  
 The stages of the theatre of the journey
  
 I see the time of willingness between plays
 Waiting and walking and the play of the body
 Silver body with its bosses and places
 One by one touched awakened into into
  
 Touched and turned one by one into     flame
  
 The theatre of the advancing goddess     Blossoming
 Smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
 Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I go 
 And far across a field over the jewel grass
  
 The play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
  
 Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
 Of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
 A supple god of searching and reaching
 Who weaves his strength     Who dances her more alive
  
 The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
  
 Always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
 Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
 When the decision to go on is made
 Along the long slopes of choice and again the world
  
 The play of poetry approaching in its solving
  
 Solvings of relations in poems and silences
 For we were born to express     born for a journey
 Caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
 And then I came to the place of mournful labor
  
 A turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
  
 Over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
 Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
 A hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
 Repeated farther than sight.     The voice saying slowly
  
 But it is hell.     I heard my own voice in the words
 Or it could be a foundation     And after the words
 My chance came.     To enter.     The theatres of the world.
  
  
 4  FRAGILE
  
 I think of the image brought into my room
 Of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
 He is asking about the moment when the Buddha
 Offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
 “Isn’t that fragile?” he asks.     The sage answers:
 “I speak to you.     You speak to me.     Is that fragile?”
  
  
 5  THE LONG BODY
  
 This journey is exploring us. Where the child stood
 An island in a river of crisis, now
 The bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
 Is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
 We pray : we dive into each other’s eyes.
  
 Whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
  
 This is the long body : into life from the beginning,
 Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
 And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
 And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
 Going as we go in the changes of the body,
 As it is changes, in the long strip of our many
 Shapes, as we range shifting through time.
 The long body : a procession of images.
  
 This moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                               We chose to be, 
 Becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                             when the harsh sound
 Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men,
 And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother feeding
 Her baby. And threats, the ambulance with open doors.
 Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We sang.
                                We are the living island,
 We the flesh of this island, being lived,
 Whoever knows us is part of us today.
  
 Whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
  
 Fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
 Reaching from darkness upward to a sun
 Of rebirth, the implacable.     And in our myth
 The Changing Woman who is still and who offers.
  
 Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
 That struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
 In ways of being, through silence, sources of light
 Arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
  
 And everything a witness of the buried life.
 This moment flowing across the sun, this force
 Of flowers and voices body in body through space.
 The city of endless cycles of the sun.
  
 I speak to you     You speak to me

title : Marching

author : Jim Harrison

text : 
At dawn I heard among bird calls 
the billions of marching feet in the churn 
and squeak of gravel, even tiny feet 
still wet from the mother's amniotic fluid, 
and very old halting feet, the feet 
of the very light and very heavy, all marching 
but not together, criss-crossing at every angle 
with sincere attempts not to touch, not to bump 
into each other, walking in the doors of houses 
and out the back door forty years later, finally 
knowing that time collapses on a single 
plateau where they were all their lives, 
knowing that time stops when the heart stops 
as they walk off the earth into the night air.

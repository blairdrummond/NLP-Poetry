I. Le Bonheur

 dogwood flakes
 what is green
  
 the petals
 from the apple
 blow on the road
  
 mourning doves
 mark the sway
 of the afternoon, bees
 dig the plum blossoms
  
 the morning
 stands up straight, the night
 is blue from the full of the April moon
  
 iris and lilac, birds
 birds, yellow flowers
 white flowers, the Diesel
 does not let up dragging
 the plow
  
                as the whippoorwill,
 the night’s tractor, grinds
 his song
  
  
               and no other birds but us
 are as busy (O saisons, O chateaux!
 Délires!
  
                 What soul
 is without fault?
  
 Nobody studies
 happiness
  
 Every time the cock crows
 I salute him
  
 I have no longer any excuse
 for envy. My life
  
 has been given its orders: the seasons
 seize
  
 the soul and the body, and make mock
 of any dispersed effort. The hour of death
  
 is the only trespass
  
  
 II. The Charge
  
 dogwood flakes
 the green
  
 the petals from the apple-trees
 fall for the feet to walk on
  
 the birds are so many they are
 loud, in the afternoon
  
 they distract, as so many bees do
 suddenly all over the place
  
 With spring one knows today to see
 that in the morning each thing
  
 is separate but by noon
 they have melted into each other
  
 and by night only crazy things
 like the full moon and the whippoorwill
  
 and us, are busy. We are busy
 if we can get by that whiskered bird,
  
 that nightjar, and get across, the moon
 is our conversation, she will say
  
 what soul
 isn’t in default?
  
 can you afford not to make
 the magical study
  
 which happiness is? do you hear
 the cock when he crows? do you know the charge,
  
 that you shall have no envy, that your life
 has its orders, that the seasons
  
 seize you too, that no body and soul are one
 if they are not wrought
  
 in this retort? that otherwise efforts
 are efforts? And that the hour of your flight
  
 will be the hour of your death?
  
  
 III. Spring
  
 The dogwood
 lights up the day.
  
 The April moon
 flakes the night.
  
 Birds, suddenly, 
 are a multitude
  
 The flowers are ravined 
 by bees, the fruit blossoms
  
 are thrown to the ground, the wind
 the rain forces everything. Noise—
  
 even the night is drummed
 by whippoorwills, and we get
  
 as busy, we plow, we move,
 we break out, we love. The secret
  
 which got lost neither hides
 nor reveals itself, it shows forth
  
 tokens. And we rush
 to catch up. The body
  
 whips the soul. In its great desire
 it demands the elixir
  
 In the roar of spring,
 transmutations. Envy
  
 drags herself off. The fault of the body and the soul
 —that they are not one—
  
 the matutinal cock clangs
 and singleness: we salute you
  
 season of no bungling

Come, my Celia, let us prove, 
While we can, the sports of love; 
Time will not be ours forever; 
He at length our good will sever. 
Spend not then his gifts in vain. 
Suns that set may rise again; 
But if once we lose this light, 
'Tis with us perpetual night. 
Why should we defer our joys? 
Fame and rumor are but toys. 
Cannot we delude the eyes 
Of a few poor household spies, 
Or his easier ears beguile, 
So removed by our wile? 
'Tis no sin love's fruit to steal; 
But the sweet thefts to reveal, 
To be taken, to be seen, 
These have crimes accounted been.

I Used to Think 
Trumbull Stickney 
1874-1904


Nature, Arts & Sciences, Philosophy, The Body

Metaphor, Imagery, Sonnet

I used to think 
The mind essential in the body, even 
As stood the body essential in the mind: 
Two inseparable things, by nature equal 
And similar, and in creation's song 
Halving the total scale: it is not so. 
Unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come 
Churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine, 
A slab of rosewood: mangled each on each 
With knocks and friction, or in deadly pain 
Sheathing each other's splinters: till at last 
Without all stuff or shape they 're jetted up 
Where in the bluish moisture rot whate'er 
Was vomited in horror from the sea.

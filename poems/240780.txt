title : Night of Voyeurs

author : Stuart Dybek

text : 
It’s more than silhouettes tonight,
 every window in the city lit,
 shades lifted, curtains open.
 As one suspected, the dark buildings
 full of lovers, undressing
 beneath light bulbs, before mirrors.
 Men & women, men & men, women & women, embracing.
 Even the loners visible, flickered
 by single candles, touching
 places they’ve usually chosen to keep secret.
 So much nakedness!
 And the streets empty
 except for the newsboys moving through shadows,
 leafless trees snatching underclothes
 out of wind, the El clattering
 above the roofs
 like a strip of blue movie.

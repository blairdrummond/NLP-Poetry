title : The Pike

author : Amy Lowell

text : 
In the brown water,
 Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine,
 Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds,
 A pike dozed.
 Lost among the shadows of stems
 He lay unnoticed.
 Suddenly he flicked his tail,
 And a green-and-copper brightness
 Ran under the water.

 Out from under the reeds
 Came the olive-green light,
 And orange flashed up
 Through the sun-thickened water.
 So the fish passed across the pool,
 Green and copper,
 A darkness and a gleam,
 And the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank
 Received it.

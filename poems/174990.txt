title : Success is counted sweetest (112)

author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
Success is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed. 
To comprehend a nectar 
Requires sorest need. 

Not one of all the purple Host 
Who took the Flag today 
Can tell the definition 
So clear of victory 

As he defeated – dying – 
On whose forbidden ear 
The distant strains of triumph 
Burst agonized and clear!

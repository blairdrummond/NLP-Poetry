title : The Heavenly City

author : Stevie Smith

text : 
I sigh for the heavenly country,
 Where the heavenly people pass,
 And the sea is as quiet as a mirror
 Of beautiful beautiful glass.
  
 I walk in the heavenly field,
 With lilies and poppies bright,
 I am dressed in a heavenly coat
 Of polished white.
  
 When I walk in the heavenly parkland
 My feet on the pasture are bare,
 Tall waves the grass, but no harmful
 Creature is there.
  
 At night I fly over the housetops,
 And stand on the bright moony beams;
 Gold are all heaven’s rivers,
 And silver her streams.

title : Van Gogh's Prayer

author : János Pilinszky

text : 
A battle lost in the cornfields 
and in the sky a victory. 
Birds, the sun and birds again. 
By night, what will be left of me? 

By night, only a row of lamps, 
a wall of yellow clay that shines, 
and down the garden, through the trees, 
like candles in a row, the panes; 

there I dwelt once and dwell no longer— 
I can't live where I once lived, though 
the roof there used to cover me. 
Lord, you covered me long ago.

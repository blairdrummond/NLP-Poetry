title : Little Bo-Peep

text : 
Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, 
And can't tell where to find them; 
Leave them alone, and they'll come home, 
Bringing their tails behind them. 

Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep, 
And dreamt she heard them bleating; 
But when she awoke, she found it a joke, 
For they were still all fleeting. 

Then up she took her little crook, 
Determined for to find them; 
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed, 
For they'd left their tails behind them. 

It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray 
Into a meadow hard by, 
There she espied their tails, side by side, 
All hung on a tree to dry. 

She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye, 
And over the hillocks she raced; 
And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should, 
That each tail be properly placed.

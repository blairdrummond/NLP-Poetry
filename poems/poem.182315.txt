O, Death! a black and pierceless pall 
    Hangs round thee, and the future state; 
No eye may see, no mind may grasp 
    That mystery of fate. 

This braid, which now alternate throbs 
    With swelling hope and gloomy fear; 
This heart, with all the changing hues,   
    That mortal passions bear-- 

This curious frame of human mould, 
    Where unrequited cravings play, 
This brain, and heart, and wondrous form 
    Must all alike decay. 

The leaping blood will stop its flow; 
    The hoarse death-struggle pass; the cheek 
Lay bloomless, and the liquid tongue 
    Will then forget to speak. 

The grave will tame me; earth will close 
    O'er cold dull limbs and ashy face; 
But where, O, Nature, where shall be 
    The soul's abiding place? 

Will it e'en live? For though its light 
    Must shine till from the body town; 
Then, when the oil of life is spent,   
    Still shall the taper burn? 

O, powerless is this struggling brain 
    To rend the mighty mystery; 
In dark, uncertain awe it waits 
    The common doom, to die.

title : Raking

text : 
Anna Bell and Lane, eighty, 
make small leaf piles in the heat, 
each pile a great joint effort, 
like fifty years of marriage, 
sharing chores a rusty dance. 
In my own yard, the stacks 
are big as children, who scatter them, 
dodge and limbo the poke 
of my rake. We’re lucky, 
young and straight-boned. 
And I feel sorry for the couple, 
bent like parentheses 
around their brittle little lawn. 
I like feeling sorry for them, 
the tenderness of it, but only 
for a moment: John glides in 
like a paper airplane, takes 
the children for the weekend, 
and I remember, 
they’re the lucky ones— 
shriveled Anna Bell, loving 
her crooked Lane.

title : [if mama / could see]

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
if mama 
could see 
she would see   
lucy sprawling   
limbs of lucy 
decorating the 
backs of chairs 
lucy hair 
holding the mirrors up   
that reflect odd   
aspects of lucy. 

if mama 
could hear 
she would hear 
lucysong rolled in the 
corners like lint 
exotic webs of lucysighs 
long lucy spiders explaining   
to obscure gods. 

if mama 
could talk 
she would talk 
good girl   
good girl   
good girl 
clean up your room.

title : Your Idea of Embracing Horror

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
Your idea of embracing horror 
was overwhelmed by the horror: 

                                                                                  in the mild 
milkiness of the afternoon, on the bluff 
that commands a vision of bank towers 
knifing up far higher than the rising, empty 
shell of the moon ... on the height where you stand 
and still can't understand your life 
as anything but slow dying, your time seeps out 
as into a warm bath, the way the exemplary career 
of Petronius the Just—pornographer and satirist- 
once leaked away.

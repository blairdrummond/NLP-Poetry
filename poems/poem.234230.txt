Love, Romantic Love



O come, soft rest of cares! come, Night! 
       Come, naked Virtue's only tire, 
The reaped harvest of the light 
    Bound up in sheaves of sacred fire, 
       Love calls to war: 
             Sighs his alarms, 
       Lips his swords are, 
             The fields his arms. 

Come, Night, and lay thy velvet hand 
    On glorious Day's outfacing face; 
And all thy crowned flames command 
    For torches to our nuptial grace. 
       Love calls to war: 
             Sighs his alarms, 
       Lips his swords are, 
             The field his arms.

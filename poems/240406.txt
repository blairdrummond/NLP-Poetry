text : 
Your death must be loved this much.
  
 You have to know the grief—now.
 Standing by the water’s edge,
  
 looking down at the wave
  
 touching you. You have to lie,
 stiff, arms folded, on a heap of earth
  
 and see how far the darkness
  
 will take you. I mean it, this, now—
 before the ghost the cold leaves
  
 in your breath, rises;
  
 before the toes are put together
 inside the shoes. There it is—the goddamn
  
 orange-going-into-rose descending
  
 circle of beauty and time.
 You have nothing to be sad about.

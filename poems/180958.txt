title : The Rose

author : Jean Valentine

text : 
a labyrinth, 
as if at its center, 
god would be there— 
but at the center, only rose, 
where rose came from,   
where rose grows— 
& us, inside of the lips & lips: 
the likenesses, the eyes, & the hair, 
we are born of, 
fed by, & marry with, 
only flesh itself, only its passage 
—out of where?    to where? 

Then god the mother said to Jim, in a dream, 
Never mind you, Jim, 
come rest again on the country porch of my knees.

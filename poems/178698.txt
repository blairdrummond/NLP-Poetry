Recurrences. 
Coppery light hesitates   
again in the small-leaved 

Japanese plum. Summer   
and sunset, the peace   
of the writing desk 

and the habitual peace   
of writing, these things   
form an order I only 

belong to in the idleness   
of attention. Last light   
rims the blue mountain 

and I almost glimpse   
what I was born to, 
not so much in the sunlight 

or the plum tree   
as in the pulse 
that forms these lines.

title : Pig Song

author : Margaret Atwood

text : 
This is what you changed me to:   
a greypink vegetable with slug 
eyes, buttock 
incarnate, spreading like a slow turnip, 

a skin you stuff so you may feed 
in your turn, a stinking wart 
of flesh, a large tuber 
of blood which munches 
and bloats. Very well then. Meanwhile 

I have the sky, which is only half   
caged, I have my weed corners,   
I keep myself busy, singing 
my song of roots and noses, 

my song of dung. Madame, 
this song offends you, these grunts   
which you find oppressively sexual,   
mistaking simple greed for lust. 

I am yours. If you feed me garbage,   
I will sing a song of garbage.   
This is a hymn.

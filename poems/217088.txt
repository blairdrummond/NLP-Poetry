Their authority did not unfold 
from ironed white shirts and thin ties 
or from the funereal seriousness that struck 
their acne-splashed faces but because 
they stood heir to our native faith in light. 

So we followed the thin white waver 
of beams they pointed down aisles 
to seats we never thought of refusing. 
It was the first job I wanted, 
especially after birthday outings 

far from home showed me the glowing 
outfits worn by big-city ushers, their get-ups 
a blend of doorman and military dictator, 
as gaudy and fine as the plots 
of movies my Saturdays were swallowed by. 

None of us knew, as they took us 
into the artificial light of the cinema, 
that they walked the path of the pin setter, 
the blacksmith or elevator operator, 
professions reduced to curiosity 

by wandering time. Only in the quick steps 
of floor salesmen, the slim backs of hostesses 
bringing us to our tables, do they remain, 
the artful flutters of their flashlights lost 
in dark we are left to find our own way through.

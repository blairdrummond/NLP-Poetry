title : The Moralists

author : Yvor Winters

text : 
You would extend the mind beyond the act,   
Furious, bending, suffering in thin 
And unpoetic dicta; you have been 
Forced by hypothesis to fiercer fact. 
As metal singing hard, with firmness racked,   
You formulate our passion; and behind   
In some harsh moment nowise of the mind 
Lie the old meanings your advance has packed. 

No man can hold existence in the head.   
I, too, have known the anguish of the right   
Amid this net of mathematic dearth, 
And the brain throbbing like a ship at night:   
Have faced with old unmitigated dread   
The hard familiar wrinkles of the earth.

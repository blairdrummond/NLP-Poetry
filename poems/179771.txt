title : Geometry

text : 
All the roofs sloped at the same angle. 
The distance between the houses was the same. 
There were so many feet from each front door 
to the curb. My father mowed the lawn 
straight up and down and then diagonally. 
And then he lined up beer bottles on the kitchen table. 

We knew them only in summer when the air 
passed through the screens. The neighbor girls 
talked to us across the great divide: attic window 
to attic window. We started with our names. 
Our whispers wobbled along a tightrope, 
and below was the rest of our lives.

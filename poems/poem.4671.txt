Sorrow is my own yard 
where the new grass 
flames as it has flamed 
often before, but not 
with the cold fire 
that closes round me this year. 
Thirty-five years 
I lived with my husband. 
The plum tree is white today 
with masses of flowers. 
Masses of flowers 
load the cherry branches 
and color some bushes 
yellow and some red, 
but the grief in my heart 
is stronger than they, 
for though they were my joy 
formerly, today I notice them 
and turn away forgetting. 
Today my son told me 
that in the meadows, 
at the edge of the heavy woods 
in the distance, he saw 
trees of white flowers. 
I feel that I would like 
to go there 
and fall into those flowers 
and sink into the marsh near them.

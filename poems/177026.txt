title : The Face

author : Franz Wright

text : 
Is there a single thing in nature 
that can approach in mystery 
the absolute uniqueness of any human face, first, then   
its transformation from childhood to old age— 

We are surrounded at every instant   
by sights that ought to strike the sane   
unbenumbed person tongue-tied, mute   
with gratitude and terror. However, 

there may be three sane people on earth   
at any given time: and if 
you got the chance to ask them how they do it,   
they would not understand.

I think they might just stare at you 
with the embarrassment of pity. Maybe smile 
the way you do when children suddenly reveal a secret   
preoccupation with their origins, careful not to cause them shame, 

on the contrary, to evince the great congratulating pleasure   
one feels in the presence of a superior talent and intelligence;   
or simply as one smiles to greet a friend who’s waking up, 
to prove no harm awaits him, you’ve dealt with and banished all harm.

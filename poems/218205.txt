text : 
Open the window and you want to fly out, 
though you never actually do—

I think I see you, still there on the ledge, 
where I've left you. 

How pulled-awake and flung 
can one life be? 

Again I thought, It will end. 
Again I promised and clung. 

I learned there that   
to cling was in my nature. 

I think I see you, though you flash 
quickly through the shutter. 

I think I hear you, though I sleep. 

Remember this as a bolero, 
a finite flaring— 

both the tulip tree   
burning in full bloom 

and the weeping silver birch.

Couplet, Epigram

Misus and Mopsa hardly could agree,
 Striving about superiority. 
 The text which says that man and wife are one,
 Was the chief argument they stood upon.  
 She held they both one woman should become,
 He held both should be man, and both but one. 
      So they contended daily, but the strife
      Could not be ended, till both were one wife.

The mower flipped it belly up, 
a baby garter less than a foot long, 
dull green with a single sharp 

stripe of pale manila down its back, 
same color as the underside 
which was cut in two places, 

a loop of intestine poking out. 

It wouldn't live, 
so I ran the blades over it again, 

and cut it again but didn’t kill it, 

and again and then again, 
a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke 
on me like a swarm of bees. 

It took so long 
my mind had time to spiral 
back to the graveyard 

I tended as a child 
for the dead ones, wild and tame: 
fish from the bubbling green aquarium, 

squirrels from the road, 
the bluejay stalked to a raucous death 
by Cicero the patient, the tireless hunter, 

who himself was laid to rest 
one August afternoon 
under a rock painted gray, his color, 

with a white splash for his white splash. 

Once in the woods I found the skeleton 
of a deer laid out like a diagram, 

long spine curved like a necklace of crude, ochre spools 
with the string rotted away, 

and the dull metal shaft of the arrow 
lying where it must have pierced 

not the heart, not the head, 
but the underbelly, the soft part 
where the sex once was. 

I carried home the skull 
with its nubs of not-yet-horns 
which the mice had overlooked, 

and set it on a rock 
in my kingdom of the dead. 

Before I chopped the little snake 
to bits of raw mosaic, 

it drew itself 
into an upward-straining coil, 
head weaving, mouth open, 

hissing at the noise that hurt it. 

The stripe was made 
of tiny paper diamonds, 
sharp-edged but insubstantial, 

like an x-ray of the spine 
or the ghost beginning to pull away. 

What taught the snake to make itself 
seem bigger than it was, 
to spend those last few seconds 

dancing in the roar 
and shadow of its death? 

Now I see, though none exists, 
its grave: 

harebells withered in a jar, 
a yellow spiral 
painted on a green-black stone, 

a ring of upright pine cones for a fence. 
That’s how the deer skull lay in state 

until one of the neighborhood dogs 
came to claim it, 

and carried it off to bury 
in the larger graveyard of the world.

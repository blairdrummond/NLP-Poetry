title : The Exact Change

author : Joel Brouwer

text : 
He slaughtered a six of Miller in thanks
 when his supposed schizophrenia turned
 out to be mere panic, fewer than half
 the syllables and “easily managed with
 the new medications.” Chanted that mantra
 when his piano teacher’s voice droned on 
 like an undertow beneath Chopin hours
 after she herself had gone home to Queens
 and when stop signs seemed to say slightly more
 than stop, seemed in fact to convey highly
 specific messages to him and him alone
 suggesting he assume certain key
 responsibilities including twenty-four-hour
 telephone contact with his finacée
 “to make sure nothing bad happens to her”
 and the immediate emergency
 closure of the Holland Tunnel…Oh, come
 on, Doc! If this isn’t schizo what is?
 And after all it took so long to nose
 the rental car’s savage servility
 through New Jersey for Thanksgiving at her
 mother’s that by the time he arrived he
 can’t possibly have been the same person
 he had been when he left Brooklyn and is
 that not a kind of multiple person-
 ality? It took hours. And then it was
 awkward. Which could describe so many things.
The gangly half-dismantled turkey splayed
on its platter. Her stepfather's lecture
on property taxes and tougher sentences.
The seven-dollar jug of Chablis which
would come up later while he held back her hair.
Every good boy deserves fudge and he tried
to be one and earn huge loamy slabs of it.
He practiced his scales on the steering wheel
as he breezed by stop sign after stop sign
toward the tunnel, stopped to search for the
exact change, then resumed rehearsal as
she, deeply soused, snored wetly beside him
smelling like something spilled on a rug. He
keyed each étude over and over as though
there would not be many more chances or
changes which I typed first by accident
but had the chance to change for which I am
thankful. But what am I doing in here.

title : [I did something I could never discuss]

author : Paul Foster Johnson

text : 
I did something I could never discuss
 made an acquaintance
 and embraced him in a phone booth.
  
 While interested parties lurked
 among free newspaper boxes
 he removed his domino.
  
 What to construe
 from leather bracelets?
 The impossibility of translation
 from a phone booth to a churchyard
  
 a gate painted white
 a belfry with no bell
 some culture with haceks
 the sense of lolling in a park
  
 from a churchyard to a community garden
 heckling the rooster as it crowed.
  
 We left the part we liked
 jeering the rooster from a sward.
  
 We reentered the garden with a script
 but refused to expand on the vestiges of happiness.
  
 A girl took responsibility for the garden
 and plied us with background information
 until her nervous guardian sent us back to the church
 with a coat of arms where we were going anyway
 as though under the influence of boreal fluid.
  
 The songbirds of the yard
 were about to be contaminated
 by a new age concert.
  
 With so little at stake
 they praised positive thinking.﻿

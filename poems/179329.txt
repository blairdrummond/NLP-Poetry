title : Morel Mushrooms

author : Jane Whitledge

text : 
Softly they come 
thumbing up from 
firm ground 

protruding unharmed. 
Easily crumbled 
and yet 

how they shouldered 
the leaf and mold 
aside, rising 

unperturbed, 
breathing obscurely, 
still as stone. 

By the slumping log, 
by the dappled aspen, 
they grow alone. 

A dumb eloquence 
seems their trade. 
Like hooded monks 

in a sacred wood 
they say: 
Tomorrow we are gone.

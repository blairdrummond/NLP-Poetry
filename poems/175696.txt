title : Maze without a Minotaur

author : Dana Gioia

text : 
If we could only push these walls   
apart, unfold the room the way   
a child might take apart a box   
and lay it flat upon the floor— 
so many corners cleared at last!   
Or else could rip away the roof   
and stare down at the dirty rooms,   
the hallways turning on themselves,   
and understand at last their plan— 
dark maze without a minotaur,   
no monsters but ourselves. 
                                       Yet who 
could bear to see it all? The slow   
descending spirals of the dust   
against the spotted windowpane,   
the sunlight on the yellow lace, 
the hoarded wine turned dark and sour, 
the photographs, the letters—all   
the crowded closets of the heart. 

One wants to turn away—and cry   
for fire to break out on the stairs   
and raze each suffocating room.   
But the walls stay, the roof remains   
strong and immovable, and we   
can only pray that if these rooms   
have memories, they are not ours.

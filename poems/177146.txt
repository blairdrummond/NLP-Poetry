A little loam and topsoil        is a lot. —Heather McHugh
A vacant lot, maybe, but even such lit vacancy 
as interstate motels announce can look, well, pretty   
damned inviting after a long day’s drive, especially 
if the day has been oppressed by manic truckers, detours,   
endless road construction. And this poorly measured, semi- 
rectangle, projected and plotted with the familiar   
little flags upon a spread of neglected terra firma 
also offers brief apprehension, which—let’s face it,   
whether pleasing or encumbered by anxiety—dwells   
luxuriously in potential. Me? Well, I like 
a little space between shopping malls, and while this one may   
never come to be much of a garden, once we rip   
the old tires from the brambles and bag the trash, we might   
just glimpse the lot we meant, the lot we hoped to find.

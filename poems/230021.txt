title : A Blessing

text : 
Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota, 
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass. 
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies 
Darken with kindness. 
They have come gladly out of the willows 
To welcome my friend and me. 
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture 
Where they have been grazing all day, alone. 
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness   
That we have come. 
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other. 
There is no loneliness like theirs.   
At home once more, 
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.   
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms, 
For she has walked over to me   
And nuzzled my left hand.   
She is black and white, 
Her mane falls wild on her forehead, 
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear 
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist. 
Suddenly I realize 
That if I stepped out of my body I would break 
Into blossom.

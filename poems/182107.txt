Her cart like a dugout canoe. 


Had been an oak trunk. 


Cut young.      Fire-scoured. 


What was bark what was heartwood :    P u r e   C h a r - H o l e 


Adze-hacked and gouged. 


Ever after (never not) wheeling hollow there behind her. 


Up the hill toward Bennett Yard; down through Eight-Mile, 
     the Narrows. 


C o m e s   C l a r y   b y   h e r e   n o w 


Body bent past bent.      Intent upon horizon and carry. 


Her null eye long since gone isinglassy, opal. 


—The potent (brimming, fluent) one looks brown. 


C o u r s e s   C l a r y   s u r e   a s   b a y o u   t h r o u g h   h e r e  n o w 


Bearing (and borne ahead by) hull and hold behind her. 


Plies the dark. 


Whole nights most nights along the overpass over Accabee. 


C r o s s e s   C l a r y   b l e s s   h e r   b a r r o w   u p   t h e r e   n o w 


Pausing and voweling there—   the place where the girl fell. 


(                  ) 


Afterwhile passing. 


Comes her cart like a whole-note held.

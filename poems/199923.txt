title : Night of Battle

author : Yvor Winters

text : 
Europe: 1944as regarded from a great distance
Impersonal the aim
Where giant movements tend; 
Each man appears the same; 
Friend vanishes from friend.

In the long path of lead 
That changes place like light 
No shape of hand or head 
Means anything tonight.

Only the common will
For which explosion spoke; 
And stiff on field and hill 
The dark blood of the folk.

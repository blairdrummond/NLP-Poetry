title : [She goes, she is, she wakes the waters]

author : Karen Volkman

text : 
She goes, she is, she wakes the waters
 primed in their wave-form, a flux of urge
 struck into oneness, the solid surge
 seeking completion, and strikes and shatters
  
 and is its fragments, distinction’s daughters
 and now, unholding, the cleave and merge
 the hew and fusing, plundering the verge
 and substance is the scheme it scatters
  
 and what it numbers in substantial sun.
 Her hands hold many or her hands hold none.
 And diving the salt will kiss a convex eye
  
 and be salt fact and be the bodied sky
 and that gray weight is both or beggared one,
 a dead dimensional, or blue begun.

title : Mother and Child

author : Louise Glück

text : 
We’re all dreamers; we don’t know who we are. 

Some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family. 
Then back to the world, polished by soft whips. 

We dream; we don’t remember. 

Machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother’s body. 
Machine of the mother: white city inside her. 

And before that: earth and water. 
Moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass. 

And before, cells in a great darkness. 
And before that, the veiled world. 

This is why you were born: to silence me. 
Cells of my mother and father, it is your turn 
to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece. 

I improvised; I never remembered. 
Now it’s your turn to be driven; 
you’re the one who demands to know: 

Why do I suffer? Why am I ignorant? 
Cells in a great darkness. Some machine made us; 
it is your turn to address it, to go back asking 
what am I for? What am I for?

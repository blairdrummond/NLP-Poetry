A hackneyed burden, to a hackneyed air,-- 
"I love thee only,--thou art wondrous fair!" 
Alas! the poets have worn the theme threadbare! 

Can I not find some words less tame and old, 
To paint thy form and face of perfect mould, 
Thy dewy lips, thy hair of brown and gold? 

Can I not sing in somewhat fresher strain 
The love I lavish and receive again,-- 
The thrilling joy, so like to thrilling pain? 

Can I not, by some metaphor divine, 
Describe the life I quaff like nectared wine 
In being thine, and knowing thou art mine? 

Ah, no! this halting verse can naught express; 
No English words can half the truth confess, 
That have not all been rhymed to weariness! 

So let me cease my scribbling for to-day, 
And maiden, turn thy lovely face this way,--
Words will not do, but haply kisses may!

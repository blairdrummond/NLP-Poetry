title : Retrospect

author : Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle

text : 
There is a better thing, dear heart, 
    Than youthful flush or girlish grace. 
There is the faith that never fails, 
    The courage in the danger place, 
The duty seen, and duty done, 
    The heart that yearns for all in need, 
The lady soul which could not stoop 
    To selfish thought or lowly deed. 
All that we ever dreamed, dear wife, 
    Seems drab and common by the truth, 
The sweet sad mellow things of life 
    Are more than golden dreams of youth.

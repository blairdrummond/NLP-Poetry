At dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay:
 Waves were broken scrolls.          Beyond Donegal, white mountains
 hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.
  
                                                                             Later, there was sleet: trees down
 on the Drumholm road; near Timoney’s farm, a frantic goose
 pinned under branches.
  
                                         All night long, we spoke of loneliness,
 long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.
  
 Then the sky cleared and a marvel began: The hills turned blue;
 in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke.
 It gathered like a dream drenched in frost.
  
 That should have been all.                           We had worn out night.
  
 But single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the
                                                                                                                                     broken fence.
 They arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram:
 a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.
  
 Their image is with me still.               The backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as
                                                                                                                                      morning.

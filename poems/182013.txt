title : Flesh of John Brown's Flesh: 2 December 1859

We knew the rules and punishments: 
three lashes for lack of diligence, 
eight for disobeying mother 

or telling lies.... No blood, he’d say, 
and no remission. Came a day 
he started keeping my account, 

as at a store. And came another 
he called me to the tannery: 
a Sunday, day of settlement. 

I’d paid one-third the owed amount 
when he, to my astonishment, 
handed the blue-beech switch to me. 

Always, the greatest of my fears 
were not his whippings, but his tears, 
and he was tearful now. I dared 

not disobey, nor strike him hard. 
“I will consider a weak blow 
no blow at all, rather a show 

of cowardice,” he said. No blood 
and no remission. Thus he paid 
himself the balance that I owed, 

our mingled blood a token of 
a thing that went unnamed: his love. 
This nation, too, is his bad child, 

fails him utterly, drives him wild 
with rage and grief and will be scourged 
nearly to death before she, purged, 

may rise and stand. No blood, I hear 
him saying still, and no remission. 
So hang him today, Virginia; cheer 

his body swaying in the air— 
tomorrow you will learn what’s true: 
hanging’s a thing he’s done for you.

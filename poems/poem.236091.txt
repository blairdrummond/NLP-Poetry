Close to the gates of Paradise I flee; 
   The night is hot and serpents leave their beds, 
   And slide along the dark, crooking their heads,-- 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

My eyes are burning so I cannot see; 
   My feet are bleeding and I suffer pain; 
   Let me come in on the cool grass again--
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

I ate the fruit of the forbidden tree, 
   And was cast out into the barren drouth; 
   And since - the awful taste within my mouth! 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

Am I shut out for all eternity? 
   I do repent me of my one black sin, 
   With prayers and tears of blood . . . Let me come in! 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

Let me come in where birds and flowers be; 
   Let me once more lie naked in the grass 
   That trembles when the long wind-ripples pass! 
Lord God, Lord God, open the gates to me!

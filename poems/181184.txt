title : Space Bar

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
Lined up behind the space bartender 
is the meaning of it all, the vessels 
marked with letters, numbers, 
signs. Beyond the flats 

the monitor looms, for all the world 
like the world. Images and 
motions, weeping women, 
men in hats. I have killed 

many happy hours here, 
with my bare hands, 
where TV passes for IV, among 
the space cadets and dingbats.

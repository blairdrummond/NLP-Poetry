title : The Promise

Stay, I said 
to the cut flowers.
They bowed 
their heads lower.

Stay, I said to the spider, 
who fled.

Stay, leaf.
It reddened,
embarrassed for me and itself.

Stay, I said to my body. 
It sat as a dog does, 
obedient for a moment, 
soon starting to tremble.

Stay, to the earth
of riverine valley meadows,
of fossiled escarpments,
of limestone and sandstone.
It looked back
with a changing expression, in silence.

Stay, I said to my loves. 
Each answered,
Always.

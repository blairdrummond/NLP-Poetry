NONES 

At three p.m. 
under sky coming to harm 
something too red flashes from a limb, 

so red it hurts: 
against sky coming apart, 
against a left-out, twice-soaked shirt, 

a cardinal 
inflames the profane cathedral 
of suburban yard its owner let fall 

into disgrace. 
How rain embarrasses 
the half-pruned hedge. The half-mown grass 

that sports a tonsure 
in reverse shines under the torture. 
Rain slicks with praise red shed, red feather. 

Crested seedeater 
out of character where 
you’re neither the strictly monkish brown thrasher 

nor the odd hermit thrush,   
you scratch in the underbrush 
of faith to see what you can flush: 

a grub. A seed.   
Eminence not grise 
but rouge, from your lipsticked beak 

you pass a sowbug 
to your mate. You peck at a slug   
sliming your path, seeming to beg 

your forgiveness. 
To what would you confess 
beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness? 


VESPERS 

There are more divine hours:   
a gold-leafed page a mower 
rows with a scythe as tall as the tower 

that tents aloft   
a tiny sky bereft 
of cloud, a chapel ceiling left 

unstarred, heaven 
a lake turned upside down, 
filled with an emptiness that’s clean 

because it’s cold,   
glacial enough to scald 
the skin it bathed, the lungs it filled. 

On devotion’s last page,   
deep in the golden age 
of illumination, the hunt’s cortège 

has halted at the edge 
of the known world, a clearing wedged   
in a forest of spears. Red bird the badge 

on the huntsman’s tunic, 
you’re the splash of crimson lake,   
the distant lordship’s flag, the cleric 

dog’s bright collar, 
its heretic tongue. It slavers 
on the bleeding stag. Snarling at prayer 

that chases belief, 
it licks the offal of grief, 
the heart cast aside reward enough.

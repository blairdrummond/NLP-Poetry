Poems for Weddings



Act I, Scene xiii, Air XVIa??a??Over the Hills, and Far Awaya?? 
Mac.    Were I laid on Greenlanda??s coast,
               And in my arms embraced my lass,
          Warm amidst eternal frost,
               Too soon the half-yeara??s night would pass.
Polly. Were I sold on Indian soil,
               Soon as the burning day was closed,
          I could mock the sultry toil
               When on my charmera??s breast reposed.
Mac.    And I would love you all the day,
Polly. Every night would kiss and play,
Mac.    If with me youa??d fondly stray
Polly. Over the hills, and far away.

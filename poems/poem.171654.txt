Ballad

The best game the fairies play, 
    The best game of all, 
Is sliding down steeples-- 
    (You know they're very tall). 
You fly to the weathercock, 
    And when you hear it crow, 
You fold your wings and clutch your things 
    And then let go! 
They have a million other games-- 
    Cloud-catching's one, 
And mud-mixing after rain 
    Is heaps and heaps of fun; 
But when you go and stay with them 
    Never mind the rest, 
Take my advice--they're very nice, 
    But steeple-sliding's best!

title : The Extension of the Dead

author : Gary Fincke

text : 
Getting drunk, a friend called women 
He had slept with, men he hated, 
And then 911, repeating 
"Emergency" like a schoolboy. 

"Try 999," I suggested, 
Giving him the hot-line number 
That Malaysians, once, imagined 
Was the extension of the dead, 

Their calls, instead, directed to 
The homes for police and firemen 
And medical help, dispatchers 
Picking up for thousands who thought, 

Immediately, they had linked 
With the calm voices of the dead. 
Cautions? Disclaimers? Those callers, 
Regardless, asked about heaven's 

Lifestyle, what it meant to be dead. 
They chanted incantations to 
Ward off whatever might travel 
Through phone lines from the afterlife. 

"What's the story with you," my friend 
Kept on repeating, receiving 
Sympathy, curses, threats, a fine. 
And the Malaysians? They, at last, 

Asked for help with the lotteryâ€” 
Because surely the selfless dead 
Knew the winning numbers, the sort 
Of thing you heard in paradise.

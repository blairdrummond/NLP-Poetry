title : An Equation for My Children

author : Wilmer Mills

text : 
It may be esoteric and perverse 
 That I consult Pythagoras to hear 
 A music tuning in the universe. 
 My interest in his math of star and sphere 
 Has triggered theorems too far-fetched to solve. 
 They don't add up. But if I rack and toil 
 More in ether than a mortal coil, 
 It is to comprehend how you revolve, 
 By formulas of orbit, ellipse, and ring. 

 Dear son and daughter, if I seem to range 
 It is to chart the numbers spiraling 
 Between my life and yours until the strange 
 And seamless beauty of equations click 
 Solutions for the heart's arithmetic.

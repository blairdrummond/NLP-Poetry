 I have so little want of activity
 even writing with its pain more terrible than life
 I don’t want but do because I’m kind of stupid finally
 not in the way, you, Sarah know I am
 nor, you reader, who think of me fishing.
 Line, spindle, lure, bait. Instruments for me
 are accessories, even the matchbook is only
 a tiara to my eyes, the fishing lure a long
 & white bracelet. Some of my
 so-called friends think of me as a derelict
 they always try to hold me to account.
 “Tell me what happened on the drunken night in question”
 On the witness stand I am a kitten
 terribly cute but I can’t say a thing
 about stupid, or fish, or last night.
 I like to lay at the base of a hill
 asleep while the shepherds work
 bringing things to heel with tepid will where I source
 my contempt in the index of swill.
 The entries there make no mention of hell
 which was sifted through the vale of tears, & fell
 to make Earth, & the base of this hill where I sunbathe & murmur
 ‘jealous cellmate’ as my willful peers go by.

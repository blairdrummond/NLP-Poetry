title : Planning the Disappearance of Those Who Have Gone

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
Soon I will make my appearance 
But first I must take off my rings 
And swords and lay them out all 
Along the lupine banks of the forbidden river 
In reckoning the days I have 
Left on this earth I will use 
No fingers

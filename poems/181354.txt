title : Prayer for an Irish Father

author : Norman Williams

text : 
On a damp June Saturday, as colorless 
As cellar stone, the working classes from 
Dun Laoghaire spread their picnic blankets, tins, 
And soda bread along the coastal cliffs. 
Two hundred feet below, the ocean knocks 
Debris and timber on the rock, and near 
The precipice, I watch a father swing 
His daughter out, as though to loose her on 
That long descent, past rookeries of gulls 
As intricate as mosques, through casual 
Alliances of mist and fog, and toward 
The cowlicked Irish Sea, as fathomless 
And bitter as their history. With each 
Return, the young girl cries out her delight, 
Then girds once more against the peril there: 
As though she knows no child is desired wholly; 
That there is not a mother, dreading birth, 
Who does not sometime curse her recklessness, 
Nor father, yoked to press or forklift truck, 
Who has not brooded on the chance of some 
Untimely accident. Pray God that such 
Black thoughts do not now reach like beggarâ€™s mitts 
Into his mind, or better pray that he 
Has vowed, despite them all, not to permit 
His difficult and gnarled grip to give.

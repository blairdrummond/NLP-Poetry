     The King asked
      The Queen, and 
      The Queen asked
      The Dairymaid:
      "Could we have some butter for
      The Royal slice of bread?"
      The Queen asked
      The Dairymaid,
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "Certainly,
      I'll go and tell
      The cow
      Now 
      Before she goes to bed."
  
      The Dairymaid
      She curtsied,
      And went and told
      The Alderney:
      "Don't forget the butter for
      The Royal slice of bread."
  
      The Alderney
      Said sleepily:
      "You'd better tell
      His Majesty
      That many people nowadays
      Like marmalade
      Instead."
  
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "Fancy!"
      And went to
      Her Majesty.
      She curtsied to the Queen, and
      She turned a little red:
      "Excuse me,
      Your Majesty,
      For taking of
      The liberty,
      But marmalade is tasty, if
      It's very
      Thickly
      Spread."
  
      The Queen said
      "Oh!"
      And went to
      His Majesty:
      "Talking of the butter for
      The Royal slice of bread,
      Many people
      Think that
      Marmalade
      Is nicer.
      Would you like to try a little
      Marmalade 
      Instead?"

      The King said,
      "Bother!"
      And then he said,
      "Oh, dear me!"
      The King sobbed, "Oh, deary me!"
      And went back to bed.
      "Nobody,"
      He whimpered,
      "Could call me
      A fussy man;
      I only want
      A little bit
      Of butter for
      My bread!"

     The Queen said,
      "There, there!"
      And went to 
      The Dairymaid.
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "There, there!"
      And went to the shed.
      The cow said,
      "There, there!
      I didn't really
      Mean it;
      Here's milk for his porringer
      And butter for his bread."
  
      The Queen took
      The butter
      And brought it to
      His Majesty;
      The King said,
      "Butter, eh?"
      And bounced out of bed.
      "Nobody," he said,
      As he kissed her
     Tenderly,
     "Nobody," he said,
     As he slid down
      The banisters,
      "Nobody,
      My darling,
      Could call me
      A fussy man--
      BUT
 I do like a little bit of butter to my bread!"

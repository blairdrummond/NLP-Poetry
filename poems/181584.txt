Such a long time as the wave idling gathers 
lofts and presses forward into the curvature 
of the height before one realizes that the 

tension completes itself with a fall through air, 
disorganization the prelude to the meandering 
of another gather and hurl, the necessary: 

ah, what can one make to absorb the astonishment: 
you should have seen me the merchant at market 
this morning: the people ogled me with severe 

goggles: maids, buying in manners and measures 
beyond themselves, stared into my goods and 
then grew horror-eyed: wives still as distant 

from day as a carrot from dinner took the 
misconnection sagely, a usual patience: 
peashells, I said, long silky peashells: cobs, 

I said, long cobs: husks and shucks, I said: 
one concerned person pointed out that my whole 
economy was wrong; yes, I said, but I have 

nothing else to sell: and I said to her, won't 
you appreciate the silky beds where seeds 
have lain: she had not come to that: and 

how about this residence all the grains have 
left: won't you buy it and think about it: 
not for dinner, she said: rinds, I cried, 

rinds and peelings: there was some interest 
in those, as for a marmalade, but no one willing, 
finally, to do the preparations: absurd, one 

woman shouted, and then I grew serious: can you 
do with that: but she was off before we fully 
met: you should have seen me the merchant at 

market this morning: will bankruptcy make a 
go of it: will the leavings be left only: the 
wave turns over and does not rise again, that wave.

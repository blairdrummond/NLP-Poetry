title : Ode to a Blizzard

O! wonderful for weight and whiteness! 
       Ideolog whose absolutes 
               Are always proven right 
                      By white and then 
               More white and white again, 
       Winning the same argument year 
After year by making the opposition 
                            Disappear! 

O! dear miniature of infinity with no 
       End in sight and no snow- 
             Flake exactly like 
                      Another, all 
             A little different no 
       Matter how many may fall, 
Just like our own DNA or the human face 
                              Eternal! 

O! still keep covering the street 
       And sidewalks, cemeteries, even 
               Our twice-shoveled drive, 
                      And all that is alive, 
               With geometries that sleet 
       Will freeze into Death's 
Impromptu vision of a heaven 
                              Wholly white! 

For we know who your sponsor is, whose will 
       You so immensely serve, 
               Whose chill is more severe 
                      Than any here. 
               Though his name may be unspoken, 
       His commandments are unbroken, 
And every monument that you erect 
                              Belongs to him!

                         I

No riches from his scanty store
   My lover could impart;
He gave a boon I valued more --
   He gave me all his heart!

                         II

His soul sincere, his generous worth,
   Might well this bosom move;
And when I asked for bliss on earth,
   I only meant his love.

                         III

But now for me, in search of gain
   From shore to shore he flies;
Why wander riches to obtain,
   When love is all I prize?

                         IV

The frugal meal, the lowly cot
   If blest my love with thee!
That simple fare, that humble lot,
   Were more than wealth to me.

                         V

While he the dangerous ocean braves,
   My tears but vainly flow:
Is pity in the faithless waves
   To which I pour my woe?

                         VI

The night is dark, the waters deep,
   Yet soft the billows roll;
Alas! at every breeze I weep --
   The storm is in my soul.

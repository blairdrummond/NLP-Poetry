title : The Singers

for Boyce
They are threatening to leave us          the nimble-throated singers 
          the little murderers with the quick pulses 
They  perch at the ends of   bare branches          their tails 
          are ragged and pitiful          the long green 
feathers are fallen out          They  go on eating and eating 
          last autumn's yellow melia berries 
They do not care that you approach          cold corpses 
       rot in the grass          in the reeds 
The gray-shouldered crows hobble about          the wren 
          barely a mouthful          cocks her pert tail 
and threatens to slaughter the white-footed cat in the bushes 
          They do not understand that they are dying 

They are threatening to leave us          how quickly we forget 
          the way they taught us how to play our voices 
opening soul to weightlessness          like the Spartan poet 
          singing under the burden of  his old bones 
to the chorus girls with their honey songs and their holy voices 
          how he wished he could scoot like a kingfisher 
lightly over the flower of  the waves          who boasted 
          I know the tunes of every bird but I Alcman 
found my words and song in the tongue of the strident partridge 
          Where will we find songs          when the sleek-headed 
mallards are gone          who chase each other around the pond 
          the reluctant duck and the lovesick drake 
The way she turns her head to the side to scold him 
          whack  whack  whack  whack  whack          the way her boyfriend 
chases off  his rival and then swims back          reeb  reeb 
          with feeble reassurances          the way 
he sits on top of  her          the way she flaps her wings 
          to keep above water          the way they look 
pleased with themselves          wagging their tails          smoothing 
          each feather back in its right place 

They are threatening to leave          but you may still catch them 
          saying goodbye          stealthed in the cedar and cypress 
at dawn          in the dark clarity between sleep and waking 
          A run of  five notes on a black flute 
another          and another          buried deep in the mix 
          how many melodies can the air hold 
And what they sing          so lovely and so meaningless 
          may urge itself  upon you          with the ache 
of   something  just beyond the point of  being remembered 
          the trace of a brave thought in the face of sadness

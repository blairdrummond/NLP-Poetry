Sonnet

I remember a house where all were good 
   To me, God knows, deserving no such thing: 
   Comforting smell breathed at very entering, 
Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood. 
That cordial air made those kind people a hood 
   All over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing 
   Will, or mild nights the new morsels of Spring: 
Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should. 

Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, 
All the air things wear that build this world of Wales; 
   Only the inmate does not correspond: 
God, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales, 
Complete thy creature dear O where it fails, 
   Being mighty a master, being a father and fond.

title : Storm Windows

People are putting up storm windows now,   
Or were, this morning, until the heavy rain   
Drove them indoors. So, coming home at noon,   
I saw storm windows lying on the ground,   
Frame-full of rain; through the water and glass 
I saw the crushed grass, how it seemed to stream   
Away in lines like seaweed on the tide 
Or blades of wheat leaning under the wind. 
The ripple and splash of rain on the blurred glass   
Seemed that it briefly said, as I walked by,   
Something I should have liked to say to you, 
Something ... the dry grass bent under the pane   
Brimful of bouncing water ... something of   
A swaying clarity which blindly echoes 
This lonely afternoon of memories 
And missed desires, while the wintry rain   
(Unspeakable, the distance in the mind!) 
Runs on the standing windows and away.

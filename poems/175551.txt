The Busy-Man's Picture
BUSINESS, thou Plague and Pleasure of my Life, 
Thou charming Mistress, thou vexatious Wife; 
Thou Enemy, thou Friend, to Joy, to Grief, 
Thou bring’st me all, and bring’st me no Relief, 
Thou bitter, sweet, thou pleasing, teazing Thing, 
Thou Bee, that with thy Honey wears a Sting; 
Some Respite, prithee do, yet do not give, 
I cannot with thee, nor without thee live.

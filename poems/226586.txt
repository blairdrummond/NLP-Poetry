The face looking into the room; 
Behind it light, shaking, like heat   
Lightning; the face calm and knowing;   
Seeing, but not seeing who I am; 
The mouth may be telling something. 

Something about our helplessness;   
Something about the confusions of beasts;   
The consequence of error; systems   
Haywire, or working; the stars gone   
All wrong in the body’s courses. 

Out on the plain of Mars, brilliantly   
Played under the lights, searched out   
Beyond any answer, the game went on   
Far into the night; the bloodiest came   
Home from the battle seeking the prize. 

The women were disgraced; hair streaming,   
Pleading into the staring: buy, buy—;   
Was it my daughter I was seeing?— 
The humiliation was pleasing: tears,   
Laughter, smiles, all mingled together. 

The light swallowed itself, a balloon   
Deflating; somewhere in the darkness   
A murmuring let itself go.

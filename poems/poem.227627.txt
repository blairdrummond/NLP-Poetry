Rhymed Stanza

I found me in a great surging space,
      At either end a door,
And I said: "What is this giddying place,
      With no firm-fixed floor,
      That I knew not of before?"
      "It is Life," said a mask-clad face.

I asked: "But how do I come here,
      Who never wished to come;
Can the light and air be made more clear,
      The floor more quietsome,
      And the doors set wide? They numb
      Fast-locked, and fill with fear."

The mask put on a bleak smile then,
      And said, "O vassal-wight,
There once complained a goosequill pen
      To the scribe of the Infinite
      Of the words it had to write
      Because they were past its ken."

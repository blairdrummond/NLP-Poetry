title : Cave Dwellers

author : A. Poulin Jr.

text : 
I’ve carved a cave in the mountainside. 
I’ve drilled for water, stocked provisions 
to last a lifetime. The walls are smooth. 
We can live here, love, safe from elements. 
We’ll invent another love that can’t destroy. 
We’ll make exquisite reproductions of our 
selves, immortal on these walls. 

                                                 And when 
this sea that can’t support us is burned clean, 
when the first new creatures crawl from it, 
gasping for water, air, more wondrous and more 
wild than earth’s first couple, they shall see 
there were two before them: you and me.

title : Oh Yeah and the Eye Stays Open

author : Edwin Torres

text : 
taking in what it hears
surprised at the way of path
the laid down before
the adventured after

smiling grip on what you want
would never let me down
I know you we say
after never having met

how listening to the other side
makes you wish for quiet
miles of ocean
beneath this rock

go on let your hair down
such subtle indignity
a sunset against a moon
looking for a way out

but I won’t say anything
won’t call you on your everything
you where you are and me right here
saying yeah with a shut mouth

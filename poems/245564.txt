title : Angelhair

author : Angela Jackson

text : 
In the redcoat she (who is I) was
 an angel, dark and bright.
  
 Mama chose the drama:
 pretty scarlet to subdue the white
 walk, a world dumb with snow,
  
 patentleather shoes to shine
 the path over ice. My
  
 father paid the way.
 His teeth salt inside the grin.
  
 I (who’s she) had a manner
 of leaping toward a light
 suddenly running into ecstasy
 or heat, exquisitely blind
 in the body racing inside it-
 self. A little fit of imagining.
  
 Thin arms, cropped wings,
 to hold the bristly branches of fir, and sing-
 ing, sisters and brothers itching,
 happy from angelhair fine as a strand of cat
 hair split six ways and brushed into the skin
 to itch and itch again.
 We were wild and giddy with gifts.
  
 It was then and always as all souls itch and spin
 in lit-red coats that float down this narrow vein,
 so we spin in O, to someone who loves us
 and suffers the world for each turn before a mirror,
 quiet as ice, we fall all through at last
 here in memory’s tiny Paradise.

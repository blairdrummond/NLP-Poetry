What will we do 
when there is nobody left 
to kill? 

       * 

40,000 gallons of oil gushing into 
the ocean 
But I 
sit on top this mountainside above 
the Pacific 
checking out the flowers 
the California poppies orange 
as I meet myself in heat 
                           I’m wondering 
where’s the Indians? 

                           all this filmstrip territory 
                           all this cowboy sagaland: 
                           not 
                           a single Indian 
                           in sight 
                   

40,000 gallons gushing up poison 
from the deepest seabeds 
every hour 

40,000 gallons   
while   
experts international   
while   
new pollutants   
swallow the unfathomable   
still:   

         no Indians 

I’m staring hard around me   
past the pinks the poppies and the precipice   
that let me see the wide Pacific   
unsuspecting   
even trivial   
by virtue of its vast surrender 

I am a woman searching for her savagery   
even if it’s doomed   

Where are the Indians? 

       * 

Crow Nose 
Little Bear 
Slim Girl 
Black Elk 
Fox Belly 

the people of the sacred trees 
and rivers precious to the stars that told 
old stories to the night 

how do we follow after you? 

falling   
snow before the firelight   
and buffalo as brothers   
to the man   

how do we follow into that? 

       * 

They found her facedown   
where she would be dancing   
to the shadow drums that humble   
birds to silent   
         flight 
They found her body held   
its life dispelled   
by ice   
my life burns to destroy 

Anna Mae Pictou Aquash   
slain on The Trail of Broken Treaties   
bullet lodged in her brain/hands   
and fingertips dismembered 

who won the only peace   
that cannot pass   
from mouth to mouth 

       * 

Memory should agitate   
the pierced bone crack 
of one in pushed-back horror   
pushed-back pain   
as when I call out looking for my face   
among the wounded coins   
to toss about   
or out   
entirely   
the legends of Geronimo   
of Pocahontas   
now become a squat   
pedestrian cement inside the tomb   
of all my trust 

as when I feel you isolate   
among the hungers of the trees 
a trembling   
hidden tinder so long unsolicited   
by flame 

as when I accept my sister dead   
when there should be 
a fluid holiness 
of spirits wrapped around the world 
redeemed by women 
whispering communion 

       * 

I find my way by following your spine 

Your heart indivisible from my real wish   
we   
compelled the moon into the evening when   
you said, “No, 
I will not let go 
of your hand.” 

       * 
                                     
Now I am diving for a tide to take me everywhere 

Below   
the soft Pacific spoils   
a purple girdling of the globe   
impregnable 

       * 

Last year the South African Minister of Justice   
described Anti-Government Disturbances as   
Part of a Worldwide Trend toward the   
Breakdown of Established Political and Cultural 
Orders 

       * 

God knows I hope he’s right.

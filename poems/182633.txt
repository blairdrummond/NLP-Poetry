title : Stray Dogs in Fall

author : Dan Stryk

text : 
The small white mutt of my 
Unsure Self trails the masterless 
Dog of the Dying World, 
                        watching him 
lope the endless block 
of yards he knew before his 
birth‚ . . . I imitate his muffled bark 
& snuffling breath, as round   
& round 
               we trot as one 
through rustling browns 
of the dying world. 

               For it's come to me 
now that a dog sniffing round 
for the perfect smell, & a place 
to pee 
            in the chilly breeze,   
is the Rudiment of Life. 

And, if so, 
            the Poetry of Fall 
is the dog of myself, untied 
at last, from the Rope 
of the World 
               dreaming 
he'll one day snuffle past   
those crackling heaps   
            of burning 
leaves, becalmed by the scent 
of smoky light, 
Alone.

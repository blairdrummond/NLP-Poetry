text : 
he hooked to the body hard 
took it well 
and loved to fight 
had seven in a row and a small fleck 
over one eye, 
and then he met a kid from Camden 
with arms thin as wires— 
it was a good one, 
the safe lions roared and threw money; 
they were both up and down many times, 
but he lost that one 
and he lost the rematch 
in which neither of them fought at all, 
hanging on to each other like lovers through the boos, 
and now he’s over at Mike’s 
changing tires and oil and batteries, 
the fleck over the eye 
still young, 
but you don’t ask him, 
you don’t ask him anything 
except maybe 
you think it’s going to rain? 
or 
you think the sun’s gonna come out? 
to which he’ll usually answer 
hell no, 
but you’ll have your important tank of gas 
and drive off.

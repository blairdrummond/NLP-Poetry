Rhymed Stanza, Refrain

1914-1918
The Garden called Gethsemane   
   In Picardy it was,   
And there the people came to see   
   The English soldiers pass. 
We used to pass--we used to pass   
   Or halt, as it might be, 
And ship our masks in case of gas   
   Beyond Gethsemane. 

The Garden called Gethsemane,   
   It held a pretty lass, 
But all the time she talked to me 
   I prayed my cup might pass.   
The officer sat on the chair, 
   The men lay on the grass,   
And all the time we halted there 
   I prayed my cup might pass. 

It didn't pass--it didn't pass- 
   It didn't pass from me. 
I drank it when we met the gas   
   Beyond Gethsemane!

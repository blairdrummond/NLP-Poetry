title : The Process of Explication

 Students, look at this table
 And now when you see a man six feet tall
 You can call him a fathom.
  
 Likewise, students when yes and you do that and other stuff
 Likewise too the shoe falls upon the sun
 And the alphabet is full of blood
 And when you knock upon a sentence in the 
 Process of explication you are going to need a lot of rags
  
 Likewise, hello and goodbye.

 Nick Algiers is my student
 And he sits there in a heap in front of me thinking of suicide
 And so, I am the one in front of him
 And I dance around him in a circle and light him on fire
 And with his face on fire, I am suddenly ashamed.
  
 Likewise the distance between us then
 Is the knife that is not marriage.

 Students, I can’t lie, I’d rather be doing something else, I guess
 Like making love or writing a poem
 Or drinking wine on a tropical island
 With a handsome boy who wants to hold me all night.
  
 I can’t lie that dreams are ridiculous.
 And in dreaming myself upon the moon
 I have made the moon my home and no one
 Can ever get to me to hit me or kiss my lips.
  
 And as my bridegroom comes and takes me away from you
 You all ask me what is wrong and I say it is
 That I will never win.

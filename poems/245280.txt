title : What the Dead Know

                             Air here is like the water
 Of an aquarium that’s been lived in for a while—clear and still
                              Beyond the rigors
 Of glass; appearing cold (and clear) as spring streams
                              Fed by snow and ice,
 But unexpectedly warm to feel, and inviting; side-lit—
                              A vitality of shadows
 Once you come into it, and long bars of light
                              Burning like spots,
 Remarkable for the absence of dust in their sharp crossfires;
                              Heavy, as crystal
 Is heavy, as if to move here would mean pushing against a force
                              Palpable, and strong;
 Yet rich with prospects of life, comfortable
                              With the idea of life,
 As if, put on its slide, every drop is stocked with wonders,
                              Swarming, about to burst—

                              Beautiful in a way,
 One element sustaining another, our message brought home
                              So that the living
 Might come to see. Harder to say that without them
                              We are nothing—
 Water without air; or to speak of our isolation,
                              Or our special loneliness;
 Or say as they look right through us, at their plants,
                              Pictures, books,
 Windows, reflections, and blank white walls,
                              That we need them,
 To orient ourselves and to tell us who we are;
                              Or that with each look
 They are swimming to within our sights; or that we are always casting
                              Wider and wider
 And that even now they are fighting to avoid our nets.

title : Clip 10

author : E. Tracy Grinnell

text : 
how this time is a fact of shared space
 looking to pass through, undifferentiated
 memory always has a back door
  
  
             no one word settles
             me
  
  
 or rather than resist
 rather than resolution
  
  
 such that lists
  
 fall from
  
 one

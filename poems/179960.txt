title : Taking Down the Tree

author : Jane Kenyon

text : 
"Give me some light!" cries Hamlet's 
uncle midway through the murder 
of Gonzago. "Light! Light!" cry scattering 
courtesans. Here, as in Denmark, 
it's dark at four, and even the moon 
shines with only half a heart. 

The ornaments go down into the box: 
the silver spaniel, My Darling 
on its collar, from Mother's childhood 
in Illinois; the balsa jumping jack 
my brother and I fought over, 
pulling limb from limb. Mother 
drew it together again with thread 
while I watched, feeling depraved 
at the age of ten. 

With something more than caution 
I handle them, and the lights, with their 
tin star-shaped reflectors, brought along 
from house to house, their pasteboard 
toy suitcases increasingly flimsy. 
Tick, tick, the desiccated needles drop. 

By suppertime all that remains is the scent 
of balsam fir. If it's darkness 
we're having, let it be extravagant.

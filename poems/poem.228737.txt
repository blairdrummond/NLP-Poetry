Rhymed Stanza

A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere, 
      With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought, 
That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear 
      A roundel is wrought. 

Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught-- 
      Love, laughter, or mourning--remembrance of rapture or fear-- 
That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought. 

As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear 
      Pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught, 
So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear, 
      A roundel is wrought.

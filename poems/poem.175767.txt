Sonnet

Vainly my heart had with thy sorceries striven: 
It had no refuge from thy love,--no Heaven 
But in thy fatal presence;--from afar
It owned thy power and trembled like a star 
O'erfraught with light and splendor. Could I deem 
How dark a shadow should obscure its beam?--
Could I believe that pain could ever dwell 
Where thy bright presence cast its blissful spell? 
Thou wert my proud palladium;--could I fear 
The avenging Destinies when thou wert near?--
Thou wert my Destiny;--thy song, thy fame, 
The wild enchantments clustering round thy name, 
Were my soul's heritage, its royal dower;
Its glory and its kingdom and its power!

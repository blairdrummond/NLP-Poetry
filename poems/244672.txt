author : Karyna McGlynn

It’s no wonder          I’m always tired          with all these tract houses—
                                     It’s night & cold
 on my belly in                                                  the undeveloped field now
                                     I have to bury her
 clothing inside                                                a black garbage bag in plot D
 police cars roll         past but continue        down the treeless parkway
                                     even after shining        
 their lights on                                                  me in my freshman sundress
                                     I can only assume
 they don’t see                                                  the significance of my presence
 but I must say          1994 is a simpler         time—not everyone is suspect
                                     I crawl up next to
 my old house                                                   & look through a lit window
                                     my mother reads
 a book in bed            I want to knock           on the glass, there’s something
                                     I need to tell her

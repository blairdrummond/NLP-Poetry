title : Debt

author : Sara Teasdale

text : 
What do I owe to you            
   Who loved me deep and long? 
You never gave my spirit wings   
   Nor gave my heart a song.    

But oh, to him I loved,            
   Who loved me not at all, 
I owe the little open gate   
   That led through heaven’s wall.

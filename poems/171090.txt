title : Sober Song

text : 
Farewell to the starlight in whiskey, 
So long to the sunshine in beer. 
The booze made me cocky and frisky 
But worried the man in the mirror. 
Goodnight to the moonlight in brandy, 
Adieu to the warmth of the wine. 
I think I can finally stand me 
Without a glass or a stein. 
Bye-bye to the balm in the vodka, 
Ta-ta to the menthol in gin. 
I'm trying to do what I ought to, 
Rejecting that snake medicine. 
I won't miss the blackouts and vomit, 
The accidents and regret. 
If I can stay off the rotgut, 
There might be a chance for me yet. 
So so long to God in a bottle, 
To the lies of rum and vermouth. 
Let me slake my thirst with water 
And the sweet, transparent truth.

title : The Nineteenth Century as a Song

author : Robert Hass

text : 
“How like a well-kept garden is your soul.”   
   John Gray’s translation of Verlaine 
& Baudelaire’s butcher in 1861 
shorted him four centimes 
on a pound of tripe. 
He thought himself a clever man 
and, wiping the calves’ blood from his beefy hands,   
gazed briefly at what Tennyson called 
“the sweet blue sky.” 

It was a warm day. 
What clouds there were 
were made of sugar tinged with blood. 
They shed, faintly, amid the clatter of carriages   
new settings of the songs 
Moravian virgins sang on wedding days. 

   The poet is a monarch of the clouds 

& Swinburne on his northern coast 
“trod,” he actually wrote, “by no tropic foot,”   
composed that lovely elegy 
and then found out Baudelaire was still alive   
whom he had lodged dreamily 
in a “deep division of prodigious breasts.” 

   Surely the poet is monarch of the clouds.   
   He hovers, like a lemon-colored kite, 
   over spring afternoons in the nineteenth century 

while Marx in the library gloom 
studies the birth rate of the weavers of Tilsit   
and that gentle man Bakunin, 
home after fingerfucking the countess,   
applies his numb hands 
to the making of bombs.

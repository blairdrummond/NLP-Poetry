 What does not change / is the will to change
  
 He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
 remembered only one thing, the birds, how
 when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
 and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
 she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
 the one they had hoped was a male
  
 Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
 He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
 I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
 he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
 in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, “The kingfishers!
 who cares 
 for their feathers
 now?”
  
 His last words had been, “The pool is slime.” Suddenly everyone,
 ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
 they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
 wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
 he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
 “The pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why 
 did the export stop?”
  
 It was then he left

 I thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said
 la lumiere”
                     but the kingfisher
 de l’aurore”
                     but the kingfisher flew west
 est devant nous!
                     he got the color of his breast
                     from the heat of the setting sun!
  
 The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
 the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
 where the color is, short and round, the tail
 inconspicuous.
  
 But not these things were the factors. Not the birds. 
 The legends are
 legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
 will not indicate a favoring wind,
 or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
 still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
 It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
 It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
 six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
 not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
  
                                                    On these rejectamenta
 (as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
 And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
                                                               a dripping, fetid mass
  
 Mao concluded:
                    nous devons
                                        nous lever
                                                          et agir!

 When the attentions change / the jungle
 leaps in
              even the stones are split
                                              they rive
  
 Or, 
 enter
 that other conqueror we more naturally recognize
 he so resembles ourselves
  
 But the E
 cut so rudely on that oldest stone
 sounded otherwise,
 was differently heard
  
 as, in another time, were treasures used:
  
 (and, later, much later, a fine ear thought
 a scarlet coat)
  
                        “of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes
                         of gold
  
                        “animals likewise,
                         resembling snails
  
                        “a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,
                         and worked with tufts of leaves, weight
                         3800 ounces
  
                        “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
                         gold, the feet
                         gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
  
                         gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
                         one yellow, the other
                         white.
  
                                      “And from each reed hung
                                       seven feathered tassels. 
  
 In this instance, the priests
 (in dark cotton robes, and dirty, 
 their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
 over their shoulders)
 rush in among the people, calling on them
 to protect their gods
  
 And all now is war
 where so lately there was peace,
 and the sweet brotherhood, the use
 of tilled fields.

 Not one death but many,
 not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is
 the law
  
                  Into the same river no man steps twice
                  When fire dies air dies
                  No one remains, nor is, one
  
 Around an appearance, one common model, we grow up
 many. Else how is it,
 if we remain the same,
 we take pleasure now
 in what we did not take pleasure before? love
 contrary objects? admire and / or find fault? use
 other words, feel other passions, have
 nor figure, appearance, disposition, tissue
 the same?
          To be in different states without a change
          is not a possibility
  
 We can be precise. The factors are
 in the animal and / or the machine the factors are
 communication and / or control, both involve
 the message. And what is the message? The message is
 a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time
  
 is the birth of the air, is
 the birth of water, is
 a state between
 the origin and
 the end, between
 birth and the beginning of
 another fetid nest
  
 is change, presents
 no more than itself
  
 And the too strong grasping of it,
 when it is pressed together and condensed,
 loses it
  
 This very thing you are

                   They buried their dead in a sitting posture
                   serpent    cane    razor   ray of the sun
  
                   And she sprinkled water on the head of my child, crying
                   “Cioa-coatl! Cioa-coatl!”
                   with her face to the west
  
                 Where the bones are found, in each personal heap
                 with what each enjoyed, there is always
                 the Mongolian louse
  
 The light is in the east. Yes. And we must rise, act. Yet
 in the west, despite the apparent darkness (the whiteness
 which covers all), if you look, if you can bear, if you can, long enough
  
                        as long as it was necessary for him, my guide
                        to look into the yellow of that longest-lasting rose
  
 so you must, and, in that whiteness, into that face, with what candor, look
  
 and, considering the dryness of the place
               the long absence of an adequate race
  
                    (of the two who first came, each a conquistador, one healed, the other
                    tore the eastern idols down, toppled
                    the temple walls, which, says the excuser
                    were black from human gore)
  
 hear
 hear, where the dry blood talks
          where the old appetite walks
  
                                                                    la piu saporita et migliore
                                                                    che si possa truovar al mondo 
  
 where it hides, look
 in the eye how it runs
 in the flesh / chalk
  
                        but under these petals
                        in the emptiness
                        regard the light, contemplate
                        the flower
  
 whence it arose
  
                with what violence benevolence is bought
                what cost in gesture justice brings
                what wrongs domestic rights involve
                what stalks
                this silence
  
                what pudor pejorocracy affronts
                how awe, night-rest and neighborhood can rot
                what breeds where dirtiness is law
                what crawls
                below

                       I am no Greek, hath not th’advantage.
                       And of course, no Roman:
                       he can take no risk that matters,
                       the risk of beauty least of all.
  
                       But I have my kin, if for no other reason than
                       (as he said, next of kin) I commit myself, and,
                       given my freedom, I’d be a cad
                       if I didn’t. Which is most true.
  
                       It works out this way, despite the disadvantage.
                       I offer, in explanation, a quote:
                       si j’ai du goût, ce n’est guères
                       que pour la terre et les pierres.
  
                       Despite the discrepancy (an ocean    courage    age)
                       this is also true: if I have any taste
                       it is only because I have interested myself
                       in what was slain in the sun
  
                               I pose you your question:
  
                       shall you uncover honey / where maggots are?
  
                               I hunt among stones

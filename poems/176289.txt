It had almost nothing to do with sex.   
                      The boy 
               in his corset and farthingale, his head- 

voice and his smooth-for-the-duration chin   
                      was not 
               and never had been simply in our pay. Or 

was it some lost logic the regional accent   
                      restores? 
               A young Welsh actor may play a reluctant 

laborer playing Thisby botching   
                      similes 
               and stop our hearts with wonder. My young friend 

he’s seven—touched his mother’s face last night   
                      and said It’s 
               wet and, making the connection he has had 

to learn by rote, You’re sad.   
                      It’s never 
               not like this for him. As if, 

the adolescents mouth wherever California spills 
                      its luminous   
               vernacular. As if, until 

the gesture holds, or passes. Let’s just   
                      say 
               we’ll live here for a while. O 

habitus. O wall. O moon. For my young   
                      friend   
               it’s never not some labored 

simulacrum, every tone of voice, each   
                      give, each 
               take is wrested from an unrelenting social 

dark. There’s so much dark to go around (how   
                      odd 
               to be this and no other and, like all 

the others, marked for death), it’s a wonder   
                      we pass 
               for locals at all. Take Thisby for instance: 

minutes ago she was fretting for lack of a beard   
                      and now 
               she weeps for a lover slain by a minute’s 

misreading. Reader, it’s   
                      sharp 
               as the lion’s tooth. Who takes 

the weeping away now takes delight as well,   
                      which feels   
               for all the world like honest 

work. They’ve never worked with mind before, 
                      the rich 
               man says. But moonlight says, With flesh.

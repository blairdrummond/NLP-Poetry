            Fame's pillar here at last we set, 
            Out-during marble, brass or jet; 
                Charmed and enchanted so 
                  As to withstand the blow 
                     O f   o v e r t h r o w ; 
                    Nor   shall   the   seas, 
                      Or     o u t r a g e s 
                    Of   storms,   o'erbear 
                     What    we    uprear; 
                    Tho'   kingdoms   fall, 
                 This   pillar   never   shall 
                 Decline   or waste at   all; 
        But   stand   for ever   by   his   own 
        Firm   and    well-fixed    foundation.

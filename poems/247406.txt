title : Family Dinner

My mother the hard boned
Chinese woman 23 years
in this country
without bothering to learn
its language
buys lean pork ribs
special order
at the Hop Sang in Chinatown
and cooks dinner
for an extended family
of twenty-five during holidays.

Seated loosely around 
the dining table 
trying to eat quietly 
I am scrubbed down 
to skin and bone, 
her oldest daughterâ€” 
spineless, a headless snake 
a woman grandfather says 
who should have her tendons 
lifted out slowly 
by the steel point 
of a darning needle 
until she writhes.

To my mother
I'm useless
but dangerous,
capable of swallowing
the family whole
into my pelvis
while I sit
waiting for the boyfriend
white and forbidden
to touch our doorbell.

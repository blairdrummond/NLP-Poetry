title : sisters

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
for elaine philip on her birthday
me and you be sisters.
 we be the same.
 me and you
 coming from the same place.
 me and you
 be greasing our legs
 touching up our edges.
 me and you
 be scared of rats
 be stepping on roaches.
 me and you
 come running high down purdy street one time
 and mama laugh and shake her head at
 me and you.
 me and you
 got babies
 got thirty-five
 got black
 let our hair go back
 be loving ourselves
 be loving ourselves
 be sisters.
 only where you sing
 i poet.

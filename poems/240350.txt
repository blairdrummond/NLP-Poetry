title : The Kiss

author : Robert Graves

text : 
Are you shaken, are you stirred
     By a whisper of love,
 Spellbound to a word
     Does Time cease to move,
 Till her calm grey eye
     Expands to a sky
 And the clouds of her hair
     Like storms go by?
  
 Then the lips that you have kissed
     Turn to frost and fire,
 And a white-steaming mist
     Obscures desire:
 So back to their birth
     Fade water, air, earth,
 And the First Power moves 
     Over void and dearth.

Is that Love? no, but Death,
    A passion, a shout,
The deep in-breath,
    The breath roaring out,
And once that is flown,
    You must lie alone,
Without hope, without life,
    Poor flesh, sad bone.

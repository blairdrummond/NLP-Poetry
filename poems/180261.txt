So much I thought was only personal, like poetry, 
like caring nothing for Caillebotte the man, 
like arriving in Chicago by bus one gray morning 
and having no place to go, going to the Art Institute 
and the rain outside became nothing 
next to the glorious gray of Paris, life-size. 
The artist dead and all my life, I thought, 
I've liked right things for wrong reasons. 

My sojourn among meticulous dreams 
continued. One summer I spent among smart children 
taking lessons and abuse from the famous mathematician 
who taught old words new: point, line, between. 
And the long nights of teaching each other other words, 
our fortunate failures. And the furious wind 
blew down from time to time among us, hurricanes 
which turned live oaks inside out like little minds, 
mine, for instance, finding its fervent mode. 

Remember that you, too, could live where men spit 
while watching you and your mother pass. 
That you want her for yourself alone. 
Remember that those men are tall as God at such moments, 
more mean. So walk among them, the afternoon cooling 
within its limits, the mosquitoes taking 
equally from black and white, true and false. 

But there was a peninsula of time I lived on 
when our family poverty left me 
the couch to sleep on, the great clock 
ticking terror through the night. Who can love 
through his childhood insomnia? Only rain 
could save me–those blessed gray 
nights of noise, when sleep, like Ali Baba's 
quartered brother, was sewn back together.

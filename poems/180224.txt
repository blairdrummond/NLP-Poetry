title : False Flowers

(for Caroline Ireland)
They were to have been a love gift, 
but when she slit the paper funnel, 
they both saw they were fake; false flowers 
he'd picked in haste from the store's display, 
handmade coloured stuff, stiff as crinoline. 

Instantly she thought of women's hands 
cutting in grimy light by a sweatshop window; 
rough plank tables strewn with cut-out 
flower heads: lily, iris, primula, scentless 
chrysanthemums, pistils rigged on wire 
in crowns of sponge-tipped stamens, 
sepals and petals perfect, perfectly 
immune to menaces from the garden. 

Why so wrong, so...flattening? Why not instead 
symbols of unchanging love? 
                                       Yet pretty enough, 
she considered, arranging them in a vase 
with dry grass and last summer's hydrangeas 
whose deadness was still (how to put it?) 
alive, or maybe the other side of life. 
Two sides, really, of the same thing? 

She laughed a little, such ideas were embarrassing 
even when kept to oneself, 
but her train of thought 
carried her in its private tunnel through supper, 
and at bedtime, brushing her teeth, 
she happened to look up at the moon. 
Its sunlit face was turned, as always, in her direction. 
The full moon, she couldn't help thinking, 
though we see only half of it. 

It was an insight she decided she could 
share with him, but when he joined her 
and together they lay in the dark, 
there seemed no reason to say anything. 
The words, in any case, would be wrong, 
would escape or disfigure her meaning. 
Good was the syllable she murmured to him, 
fading into sleep. And just for a split second, 
teetering on the verge of it, she believed 
everything that had to be was understood.

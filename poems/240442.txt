title : Red Poppy

That linkage of warnings sent a tremor through June
 as if to prepare October in the hardest apples.
 One week in late July we held hands
 through the bars of his hospital bed. Our sleep
 made a canopy over us and it seemed I heard
 its durable roaring in the companion sleep
 of what must have been our Bedouin god, and now
 when the poppy lets go I know it is to lay bare
 his thickly seeded black coach
 at the pinnacle of dying.
  
 My shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk
 but grazed on down the hillside, their prayer flags
 tearing at the void—what we
 stared into, its cool flux
 of blue and white. How just shaking at flies
 they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise
 of bells braided into their manes. My life
  
 simplified to “for him” and his thinned like an injection
 wearing off so the real gave way to 
 the more-than-real, each moment’s carmine
 abundance, furl of reddest petals
 lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black
 hussar’s hat at the center. By then his breathing stopped
 so gradually I had to brush lips to know
 an ending. Tasting then that plush of scarlet
 which is the last of warmth, kissless kiss
 he would have given. Mine to extend a lover’s right past its radius,
 to give and also most needfully, my gallant hussar,
 to bend and take.

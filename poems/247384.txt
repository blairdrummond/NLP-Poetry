text : 
Can be cracked or am that       you didn't 
consider me or I thought so 
recovering in a nap     You took the 4th 
of July beers

   In the movie 
she was Asian and playing an Asian 
part   singing white on white in the white 
room

      I want to strum 
or mask this day

Ask a question
of the large “picture” window
like why and why and also why 
to think of the napalmed girl 
in the picture

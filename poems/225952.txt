title : An Oregon Message

author : William E. Stafford

text : 
When we first moved here, pulled   
the trees in around us, curled   
our backs to the wind, no one   
had ever hit the moon—no one. 
Now our trees are safer than the stars,   
and only other people's neglect   
is our precious and abiding shell, 
pierced by meteors, radar, and the telephone. 

From our snug place we shout 
religiously for attention, in order to hide:   
only silence or evasion will bring 
dangerous notice, the hovering hawk 
of the state, or the sudden quiet stare   
and fatal estimate of an alerted neighbor. 

This message we smuggle out in   
its plain cover, to be opened   
quietly: Friends everywhere— 
we are alive! Those moon rockets   
have missed millions of secret   
places! Best wishes. 

Burn this.

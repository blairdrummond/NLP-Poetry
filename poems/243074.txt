title : Love Song: I and Thou

author : Alan Dugan

Nothing is plumb, level, or square:
      the studs are bowed, the joists
 are shaky by nature, no piece fits
      any other piece without a gap
 or pinch, and bent nails
      dance all over the surfacing
 like maggots. By Christ
      I am no carpenter. I built
 the roof for myself, the walls
      for myself, the floors
 for myself, and got 
      hung up in it myself. I
 danced with a purple thumb
      at this house-warming, drunk
 with my prime whiskey: rage.
      Oh I spat rage’s nails
 into the frame-up of my work:
      it held. It settled plumb,
 level, solid, square and true
      for that great moment. Then
 it screamed and went on through,
      skewing as wrong the other way.
 God damned it. This is hell,
      but I planned it. I sawed it,
 I nailed it, and I
      will live in it until it kills me.
 I can nail my left palm
      to the left-hand crosspiece but
 I can’t do everything myself.
      I need a hand to nail the right,
 a help, a love, a you, a wife.

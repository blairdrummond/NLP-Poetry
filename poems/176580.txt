title : Piute Creek

text : 
One granite ridge 
A tree, would be enough 
Or even a rock, a small creek, 
A bark shred in a pool. 
Hill beyond hill, folded and twisted   
Tough trees crammed 
In thin stone fractures 
A huge moon on it all, is too much.   
The mind wanders. A million 
Summers, night air still and the rocks   
Warm.   Sky over endless mountains.   
All the junk that goes with being human   
Drops away, hard rock wavers 
Even the heavy present seems to fail   
This bubble of a heart. 
Words and books 
Like a small creek off a high ledge   
Gone in the dry air. 

A clear, attentive mind 
Has no meaning but that 
Which sees is truly seen. 
No one loves rock, yet we are here.   
Night chills. A flick 
In the moonlight 
Slips into Juniper shadow: 
Back there unseen 
Cold proud eyes 
Of Cougar or Coyote 
Watch me rise and go.

The problem 
of time.          Of there not being   
enough of it. 

My girl came to the study 
and said Help me; 
I told her I had a time problem   
which meant: 
I would die for you but I don’t have ten minutes.   
Numbers hung in the math book   
like motel coathangers. The Lean   
Cuisine was burning 
like an ancient city: black at the edges,   
bubbly earth tones in the center.   
The latest thing they’re saying is lack   
of time might be 
a “woman’s problem.” She sat there   
with her math book sobbing— 
(turned out to be prime factoring: whole numbers   
dangle in little nooses) 
Hawking says if you back up far enough   
it’s not even 
an issue, time falls away into 
'the curve' which is finite, 
boundaryless. Appointment book,   
soprano telephone— 
(beep End beep went the microwave) 

The hands fell off my watch in the night. 
I spoke to the spirit 
who took them, told her: Time is the funniest thing   
they invented. Had wakened from a big 
dream of love in a boat 
No time to get the watch fixed so the blank face   
lived for months in my dresser, 
no arrows 
for hands, just quartz intentions, just the pinocchio   
nose         (before the lie) 
left in the center;            the watch 
didn’t have twenty minutes; neither did I. 
My girl was doing 
her gym clothes by herself;         (red leaked 
toward black, then into the white 
insignia)                  I was grading papers, 
heard her call from the laundry room:   
Mama? 
Hawking says there are two 
types of it, 
real and imaginary (imaginary time must be   
like decaf), says it’s meaningless 
to decide which is which 
but I say: there was tomorrow- 
and-a-half 
when I started thinking about it; now   
there’s less than a day. More 
done. That’s 
the thing that keeps being said. I thought   
I could get more done as in: 
fish stew from a book. As in: Versateller   
archon, then push-push-push 
the tired-tired around the track like a planet.   
Legs, remember him? 
Our love—when we stagger—lies down inside us. . .   
Hawking says 
there are little folds in time 
(actually he calls them wormholes) 
but I say: 
there’s a universe beyond 
where they’re hammering the brass cut-outs .. . 
Push us out in the boat and leave time here—          

(because: where in the plan was it written,   
You’ll be too busy to close parentheses, 
the snapdragon’s bunchy mouth needs water,   
even the caterpillar will hurry past you? 
Pulled the travel alarm 
to my face: the black 
behind the phosphorous argument kept the dark   
from being ruined. Opened   
the art book 
—saw the languorous wrists of the lady 
in Tissot’s “Summer Evening.” Relaxed. Turning   
gently. The glove 
(just slightly—but still:)   
“aghast”; 
opened Hawking, he says, time gets smoothed   
into a fourth dimension   
but I say 
space thought it up, as in: Let’s make 
a baby space, and then 
it missed. Were seconds born early, and why   
didn’t things unhappen also, such as 
the tree became Daphne. . . 

At the beginning of harvest, we felt 
the seven directions. 
Time did not visit us. We slept 
till noon. 
With one voice I called him, with one voice   
I let him sleep, remembering 
summer years ago, 
I had come to visit him in the house of last straws   
and when he returned 
above the garden of pears, he said 
our weeping caused the dew. . . 

I have borrowed the little boat 
and I say to him Come into the little boat,   
you were happy there; 

the evening reverses itself, we’ll push out   
onto the pond, 
or onto the reflection of the pond,   
whichever one is eternal

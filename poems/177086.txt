title : Moonlight: Chickens On The Road

author : Robert Wrigley

Called out of dream by the pitch and screech,   
I awoke to see my mother’s hair 
set free of its pincurls, springing out 
into the still and hurtling air 
above the front seat and just as suddenly gone.   
The space around us twisted, 
and in the instant before the crash 
I heard the bubbling of the chickens, 
the homely racket they make at all speeds,   
signifying calm, resignation, oblivion. 

And I listened. All through the slash 
and clatter, the rake of steel, shatter of glass,   
I listened, and what came 
was a blizzard moan in the wind, a wail   
of wreckage, severed hoses and lives, 
a storm of loose feathers, and in the final   
whirl approximating calm, the cluck   
and fracas of the birds. I crawled 
on hands and knees where a window should   
have been and rose uneven 

in November dusk. Wind blew 
a snow of down, and rows of it quivered along   
the shoulder. One thin stream of blood 
oozed, flocked in feathers. 
This was in the Ozarks, on a road curving miles   
around Missouri, and as far as I could 
see, no light flickered through the timber,   
no mail box leaned the flag 
of itself toward pavement, no cars 
seemed ever likely to come along. 

So I walked, circled the darkening disaster   
my life had come to, and cried. 
I cried for my family there, 
knotted in the snarl of metal and glass;   
for the farmer, looking dead, half in 
and half out of his windshield; and for myself,   
ambling barefoot through the jeweled debris,   
glass slitting little blood-stars in my soles,   
my arm hung loose at the elbow 
and whispering its prophecies of pain. 

Around and around the tilted car 
and the steaming truck, around the heap 
of exploded crates, the smears and small hunks   
of chicken and straw. Through 
an hour of loneliness and fear 
I walked, in the almost black of Ozark night,   
the moon just now burning into Missouri. Behind me,   
the chickens followed my lead, 
some fully upright, pecking 

the dim pavement for suet or seed, 
some half-hobbled by their wounds, worthless wings   
fluttering in the effort. The faintest 
light turned their feathers phosphorescent, 
and as I watched they came on, as though they believed   
me some savior, some highwayman 
or commando come to save them the last night   
of their clucking lives. This, they must have 
believed, was the end they’d always heard of, 
this the rendering more efficient than the axe, 

the execution more anonymous than 
a wringing arm. I walked on, no longer crying, 
and soon the amiable and distracted chattering came   
again, a sound like chuckling, or the backward suck   
of hard laughter. And we walked   
to the cadence their clucking called,   
a small boy towing a cloud around a scene   
of death, coming round and round   
like a dream, or a mountain road,   
like a pincurl, like pulse, like life.

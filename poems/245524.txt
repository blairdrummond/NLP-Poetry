title : After the Auction, I Bid You Good-Bye

You elbow me with your corduroy jacket
 when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up.
 I can’t hear your whispers above the auctioneer’s racket.
  
 The clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked
 me up when you impersonated him in bed. Like a wild, thick mop
 I soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket.
  
 In two days, I will drive you to the airport, packed
 with other couples pressed tightly at the top
 of the escalator. Lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket
  
 when we hug—then a quick kiss good-bye tacked
 on at the end. I’ll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup
 you leave in my car. When I hear your name I can’t forget
  
 how your long torso pressed against my bare back,
 bluish in this early light. Your fingers shot into me, popped
 my spine into a wicked arch. There is no lack
  
 of how it haunts me still—what I bid—lost, sacked
 and wrapped for other girls. I should have looked up
 to see who else was bidding, but I studied the folds in your jacket.
 My limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer’s racket.

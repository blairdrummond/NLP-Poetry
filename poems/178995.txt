title : Money Won’t Change It (but time will take you on)

author : Cornelius Eady

text : 
You’re rich, lady, hissed the young woman at   
My mother as she bent in her garden.   
Look at what you’ve got, and it was   
Too much, the collards and tomatoes,   
A man, however lousy, taking care   
of the bills. 

This was the reason for the early deaths   
My mother was to find from that point on,   
Turned dirt and the mock of roots, 
Until finally, she gave her garden up.   
You can’t have nothing, she tells us, 
Is the motto of our neighborhood, 
These modest houses 
That won’t give an inch.

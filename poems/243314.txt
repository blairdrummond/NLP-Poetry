text : 
Winter in the country, Southampton, pale horse
 as the soot rises, then settles, over the pictures
 The birds that were singing this morning have shut up
 I thought I saw a couple kissing, but Larry said no
 It’s a strange bird. He should know. & I think now
 “Grandmother divided by monkey equals outer space.” Ron
 put me in that picture. In another picture, a good-
 looking poet is thinking it over, nevertheless, he will
 never speak of that it. But, his face is open, his eyes
 are clear, and, leaning lightly on an elbow, fist below
 his ear, he will never be less than perfectly frank,
 listening, completely interested in whatever there may 
be to hear. Attentive to me alone here. Between friends,
 nothing would seem stranger to me than true intimacy.
 What seems genuine, truly real, is thinking of you, how
 that makes me feel. You are dead. And you’ll never
 write again about the country, that’s true.
 But the people in the sky really love
 to have dinner & to take a walk with you.

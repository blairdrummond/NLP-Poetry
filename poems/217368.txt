Who was my teacher at Harvard. Did not wear overcoat 
Saying to me as we walked across the Yard 
Cold brittle autumn is you should be wearing overcoat. I said 
You are not wearing overcoat. He said, 
You should do as I say not do as I do. 
Just how American it was and how late Forties it was 
Delmore, but not I, was probably aware. He quoted Finnegans Wake to me 
In his New York apartment sitting on chair 
Table directly in front of him. There did he write? I am wondering. 
Look at this photograph said of his mother and father. 
Coney Island. Do they look happy? He couldn't figure it out. 
Believed Pogo to be at the limits of our culture. 
Pogo. Walt Kelly must have read Joyce Delmore said. 
Why don't you ask him? 
Why don't you ask Walt Kelly if he read Finnegans Wake or not. 
Your parents don't look happy but it is just a photograph. 
Maybe they felt awkward posing for photographs. 
Maybe it is just a bad photograph. Delmore is not listening 
I want to hear him tell me something sad but however true. 
Delmore in his tomb is sitting. People say yes everyone is dying 
But here read this happy book on the subject. Not Delmore. Not that rueful man.

title : The Secret

author : Denise Levertov

text : 
Two girls discover   
the secret of life   
in a sudden line of   
poetry. 

I who don’t know the   
secret wrote   
the line. They   
told me 

(through a third person)   
they had found it 
but not what it was   
not even 

what line it was. No doubt   
by now, more than a week   
later, they have forgotten   
the secret, 

the line, the name of   
the poem. I love them   
for finding what   
I can’t find, 

and for loving me   
for the line I wrote,   
and for forgetting it   
so that 

a thousand times, till death   
finds them, they may   
discover it again, in other   
lines 

in other   
happenings. And for   
wanting to know it,   
for 

assuming there is   
such a secret, yes,   
for that   
most of all.

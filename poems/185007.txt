title : Lava and Sand

author : Hester Knibbe

text : 
The soil I’m walking over comes   

from deeper: a fire had done it in,   
a stewpot had suddenly popped   
and its contents streamed   
out wave over wave until   
it reached the water, until the sea   
called it a day and struck back   

with a counterwave. Stony nightblack   
dreambarren land where tawny   
thyme wrestles up and thistle is stitched   
to every bare thing. Over this malevolence   
I carry you in me,   
sevenmonths deadchild, out to the sea

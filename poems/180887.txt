title : Once We Played

author : Mathilde Blind

text : 
Once we played at love together—
    Played it smartly, if you please;
Lightly, as a windblown feather,
    Did we stake a heart apiece.

Oh, it was delicious fooling!
    In the hottest of the game,
Without thought of future cooling,
    All too quickly burned Life’s flame.

In this give-and-take of glances,
    Kisses sweet as honey dews,
When we played with equal chances,
    Did you win, or did I lose?

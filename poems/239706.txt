(After Raymond Carver’s Hummingbird)
Suppose I said the word “springtime”
 and I wrote the words “king salmon”
 on a piece of paper
 and mailed it to you.
 When you opened it
 would you remember that afternoon we spent
 together in the yellow boat
 when the early whales were feeding 
 and we caught our first fish of the year?
  
 Or would you remember that time off Cape Flattery
 when you were a little girl:
 your father smoking, telling stories as he ran the boat,
 then the tug and zing of that very first fish
 spooling off into the gray-green world;
 you laughing and brushing back your hair
 before setting the hook?
  
 I know I am hard to understand sometimes
 particularly when you are standing
 at the post office with only a piece of paper
 saying “king salmon” on it
 but just think of it as a promissary note
 and that electric tug, that thrill
 pulling your mind into deep water
 is how I feel about you every,
 single day.

title : I Walked in the House

author : Catherine Wagner

text : 
I walked in the house
 on the flat aspect of the wood
 I took rectangular instruction of the wood
  
 when I walked I turned at the wall
 and on the flat I moved steadily
  
 unimpeded, not tumbling, climbing or short of breath.
 I walked in ease on the flat.
  
  
  
                                                               Something electric charged into our account
 and zinged out of it, pre-instructed
  
 and paid for the house. I felt
 house on my heel then instep and toe.
 I had a bad foot and I paid
 to get it fixed so I could walk here.
 I paid for the house and I paid for the
 foot that touches it. I paid to be
 directed rectangularly and down a hall.
 I curved my body to direct
 my waste through a hole. I am helped
 and paying for it.
  
 all of me exchanged,
 housing exchange. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
                                    I saw us standing
    up in the world.
 And we sank into
    exchange
   vibrating transparency
                  like a sea nettle
               afloat in the night sea
   
 the edges of the sea-veil
       tensed slapping above, visible
 when the wind crevassed and doilied
  
  
                                                            If there is a ceiling to exchange
                                                                         and above it sky
                                                           I don’t can’t see it and I don’t know why
                                                                         I want it
                                                                above my house which is crystalline gel edges
  
                  because the whole world’s disappeared
                                                                                               viewed as exchange
  
  
  
  
  
  
 I broke my arm and the window
 integrally to exchange.
  
 I paid someone to fix me and improve
 the window, triple-glazing it, and warmer
 I rebounded       knit in knit up.
 All parties to the event’s aftermath
                      were paid.
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Suppose I did not go in pain
                    to hospital, did not visit and revisit
 for x-rays, left the window smashed
                   and sat here by it,
             stuck up
                 among the crystalline
                             and cold.
 I was painful and determined
 not to play, and with the other unemployed
 weighed —
  
                        the ghostship
 sagged with holes.
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
                                           —So you want to be a thing outside exchange?
  
                                               Drain out the dying bath 
                                               see what color you are?
  
  
  
  
  
 The coin changed hands
  
  
 identical      with a will
 to transact.

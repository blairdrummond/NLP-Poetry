text : 
I have no conscience because I
 always chew my pencil. Can we say
 white paper
 with black lines on it
 is like a human body? This question
 not to be decided by pointing
 at a tree nor yet by a description
 of simple pleasures.
  
  
 Smell of retrieval. Led to expect the wrong
 answer. An arsenal without purpose
 but why yes please.
 There is no touching the black box. 
 The tree not pointed at lives
 in your bringing up the subject
 and leaves space for need, falling.
  
  
 The white ground. The waning heat.
 I’d like
 to say the history of the world.
 Or that grammar
 milks essence into propositions
 of human kindness.
  
  
 The difficulty here’s not true or false
 but that the picture’s in the foreground
 and its sense back where the gestures link 
 so closely to the bone
 the words
 give notice.
 The application is not easy.

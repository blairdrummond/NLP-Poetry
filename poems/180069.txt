title : Nemesis

author : Emily Fragos

text : 
The old men with too much gamble in them, whose eyes 

Are at peace only when all is lost, see the Queen's quiet face 

On the deck of cards, the red cuff of  her cloak, the raw tip 

Of  her tongue, the blood on her dress    . . .    What fled from them 

In their frenzies comes tiptoeing back, choiring, to the marble 

Concert hall where Nemesis, in velvet opera cape, is beginning 

Her recitative: it is your turn to go slowly now, with hands 

clasped behind your back, drowsy from the earth's sweet 

abundance and her great deprivations, the rows of crooked trees, 

the streets' bright monotony, and gather up the starving . . .

Sonnet, Allusion

Standing aloof in giant ignorance, 
   Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades, 
As one who sits ashore and longs perchance 
   To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas. 
So thou wast blind;--but then the veil was rent, 
   For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live, 
And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent, 
   And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive; 
Aye on the shores of darkness there is light, 
   And precipices show untrodden green, 
There is a budding morrow in midnight, 
   There is a triple sight in blindness keen; 
Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel 
To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell.

title : The Thrift Shop Dresses

author : Frannie Lindsay

text : 
I slid the white louvers shut so I could stand in your closet 
a little while among the throng of flowered dresses 
you hadnâ€™t worn in years, and touch the creases 
on each of their sleeves that smelled of forgiveness
and even though you would still be alive a few more days 
I knew they were ready to let themselves be 
packed into liquor store boxes simply 
because you had asked that of them,
and dropped at the door of the Salvation Army 
without having noticed me 
wrapping my arms around so many at once 
that one slipped a big padded shoulder off of its hanger 
as if to return the embrace.

title : Djinn

author : Rae Armantrout

text : 
Haunted, they say, believing 
the soft, shifty 
dunes are made up 
of false promises. 

Many believe   
whatever happens   
is the other half 
of a conversation. 

Many whisper 
white lies 
to the dead. 

"The boys are doing really well." 

Some think 
nothing is so 
until it has been witnessed. 

They believe 
the bits are iffy; 

the forces that bind them, 
absolute.

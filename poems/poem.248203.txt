Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

When Winter's ahead,
 What can you read in November
 That you read in April
 When Winter's dead?
  
 I hear the thrush, and I see
 Him alone at the end of the lane
 Near the bare poplar's tip,
 Singing continuously.
  
 Is it more that you know
 Than that, even as in April,
 So in November,
 Winter is gone that must go?
  
 Or is all your lore
 Not to call November November,
 And April April,
 And Winter Winter--no more?
  
 But I know the months all,
 And their sweet names, April,
 May and June and October,
 As you call and call
  
 I must remember
 What died into April
 And consider what will be born
 Of a fair November;
  
 And April I love for what
 It was born of, and November
 For what it will die in,
 What they are and what they are not,
  
 While you love what is kind,
 What you can sing in
 And love and forget in
 All that's ahead and behind.

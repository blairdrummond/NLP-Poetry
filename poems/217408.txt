title : For a Student Sleeping in a Poetry Workshop

I've watched his eyelids sag, spring open 
   Vaguely and gradually go sliding 
      Shut again, fly up 
With a kind of drunken surprise, then wobble 
   Peacefully together to send him 
      Home from one school early. Soon his lashes 
Flutter in REM sleep. I suppose he's dreaming 
   What all of us kings and poets and peasants 
      Have dreamed: of not making the grade, 
Of draining the inexhaustible horn cup 
   Of the cerebral cortex where ganglions 
      Are ganging up on us with more connections 
Than atoms in heaven, but coming up once more 
   Empty. I see a clear stillness 
      Settle over his face, a calming of the surface 
Of water when the wind dies. Somewhere 
   Down there, he's taking another course 
      Whose resonance (let's hope) resembles 
The muttered thunder, the gutter bowling, the lightning 
   Of minor minions of Thor, the groans and gurgling 
      Of feral lovers and preliterate Mowglis, the songs 
Of shamans whistled through bird bones. A worried neighbor 
   Gives him the elbow, and he shudders 
      Awake, recollects himself, brings back 
His hands from aboriginal outposts, 
   Takes in new light, reorganizes his shoes, 
      Stands up in them at the buzzer, barely recalls 
His books and notebooks, meets my eyes 
   And wonders what to say and whether to say it, 
      Then keeps it to himself as today's lesson.

title : Her Name is Rose

text : 
With a boil the size of an egg 
protruding from her right hip, 
she knows what I must do, 
and to stall me has locked herself 
inside the bathroom, bargaining 
for a way out. 

But it’s too late: I’ve seen 
the oozing wounds stopped up with bits 
of toilet paper and tape, the scarified 
pockets that crater the surface 
of her arms, buttocks, thighs. 

A mean fix torched her last vein 
years ago, and she’s been banging the dope 
ever since, puncturing her body 
like a juju doll. She wants to kick, 
but not now. 

I’m not gonna lie to you, she says 
in a velvet voice. I already know what she’s after: 
something stronger than local, a few Percocet, a shot of Demerol 
before she’ll let me begin. 

All I can tell you is, when the abscess finally drains 
the odor is so foul it’s evil. 

And I’m not sure, driving home 
later that night, still smelling the pallid citrus, 
whether it’s merely hallucination, the way 
her memory inhabits me; or if being 
in that same room, inhaling 
that same air, made some of her 
part of me. 

                  And whose veins 
are these, beginning to twitch?

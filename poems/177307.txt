A French scholar says he affected the Chinese manner.   
When he took his friends into the countryside   
To look at blossoms, they all saw Chinese blossoms.   
He dressed accordingly and wept for the wild geese of Shosho.

One year after making love through the short midsummer night 
He walked home at dawn and noticed that the river Oi   
Had sunk two feet. The following year was better.   
He saw bubbles of crab-froth among the river reeds.

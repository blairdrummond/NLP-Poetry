title : Eating Them As He Came

author : Christopher Todd Matthews

Dark by five, the day gives up and so do I, 
stalled at the top of the stairs I forget what for, 
adrift in a scrap of dream that’s not a dream 
exactly but a stupor, unrefined. I go astray 
in old routines, I dare myself to reconstruct 
the rules of old invented games—that one 
of throwing snowballs at the roof, to watch them 
shrink as they rolled down, spinning to their pits, 
to see the force that made them briefly a thing 
so neatly undone. Today an old friend’s tiny boy 
lobbied me to pitch some snowballs at him. I bowed 
to his dense little will. But planned to miss. 
As I packed and flung each one to its unpacking, 
he hunted down the humble bits and crumbs 
of every impact, as they ran from him along 
the icy slope, and gathered and carried them 
back to me at the top. Eating them as he came. 
So that’s how you get to the marrow of breakdown. 
I forgot. That you could put what’s left to your lips.

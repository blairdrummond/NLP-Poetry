title : The Sympathizers

author : Josephine Miles

text : 
To this man, to his boned shoulders 
Came the descent of pain.
All kinds,
Cruel, blind, dear, horrid, hallowed, 
Rained, again, again.

To this small white blind boned face, 
Wherever it was,
Descended
The blows of pain, it took as it were blinded, 
As it were made for this.

We were there. We uneasy
Did not know if it were.
Knew neither
The reason nor the man nor whether 
To share, or to beware.

 Certain labels are impervious
 to solvents, impermeable
 as drawn bridges.
  
 Adherents are bound
 to bridge and tunnel
 around
                        columns
  
                        of figures
                        playbills
                        newsprint
                        and smoke
                        dispelled
                        by the wind
  
                        in Stovepipe Town.

 Tall buildings tip on casters
 or are counter-
 weighted
 also by the lurid light of subways.
 Dust gathers on the wainscoting.
  
 She runs a hand around a column
 marbled
 with the spectral pain
 of amputees
  
 Containing decomposure
 in dividing cells, abiding
 effacement
 the door plaques and pediments
 engraved with dispelled words.
  
 Concentric desire outspreads
 her strained connectives:
  
 she’s diaphanous,
 dazed and diffused,
 flecked like fake marble.

 There’s a devotion called unflagging 
 to seeing oneself in surfaces
 in a window, a shadow, a standard,
 or the immediate space around another body.
 She rubs against the space between them,
 like that of repellant magnets.
  
 And he does his part in words
 with the sound of empty
 soda bottles.

 As a child on the stop,
 she traced her tarsals,
 sucked the bend of her elbow.
 Some parts of herself she’s forgotten,
 though others who’ve loved her
 know them better.
  
 This ease-based knowledge replaced
 by a longing spiral on a spinning disk
  
 pushing outward from an empty center.

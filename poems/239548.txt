text : 
instead of entrance
 Goodbye means Avoir
  
 Sved’s dream said from nowhere
  
 of aliquant angles
  
 some spindle of the sun
  
 empirically facted
 deafening skin
  
 open and afterwards
  
 a cough is a couch
 idled into
  
 without rain
 an island
  
 easily a third worse
  
 Indigo with a flame-red tongue





subjects : Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals

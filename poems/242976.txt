title : Song for Connie

author : Bill Berkson

text : 
The sun met the moon at the corner
           noon in thin air
 
Commotion you later
           choose to notice
 
Love shapes the heart
           that once was pieces
 
You take in hand
           the heart in mind
 
Your fate’s consistent
           alongside mine
 
Unless a mess
           your best guess
 
That is right, thanks, the intimate
           fact that you elect it
 
At corners, dressed or naked, with lips taste         
           full body, time thick or thin, fixated
 
Love, take heart
           as heart takes shape
 
And recognition
           ceases to be obscure
 
One line down the center
           another flying outward enters

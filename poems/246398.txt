title : Blue Grace

author : Philip Lamantia

text : 

                             crashes thru air 
where Lady LSD hangs up all the floors of life for the last time 
Blue Grace leans on white slime
Blue Grace weaves in & out of Lüneburg and ‘My Burial Vault’ undulates 
from first hour peyote turnon 
Diderot hand in hand with the Marquis de Sade 
wraps himself up in a mexican serapé 
at Constitution Hall, Philadelphia, 1930

Blue Grace turns into the Count of Saint-Germain 
      who lives forever
            cutting up George Washington 
dream of pyramid liquefactions from thighs of Versailles

Blue Grace intimidates Nevil Chamberlain
feels up Fillippo Marinetti
and other hysterics of the phallic rose

Blue Grace dressed up as automobile sperm
      My Claw of the future
      and the almond rose Rich the Vampire wears 
                                            over the US Army 
— flags !
    american flags !

                            flying like bats 
           out of ‘ My Burial Vault ’ ! 
flood museums
                   where Robespierre’s murder is plotted 
                                     — floated from Texcoco, 
the Prince of Bogota caught redhanded 
sniffing forty cans of Berlin ether !

                                      Hydrek ice blue teeth 
                    impersonates, psycho-kinetically, 
the resurrection of Blue Grace as prophetess of the anti-planet system

Blue Grace under dark glasses 
getting out of one hundred white cars at once ! 
Cars of ectoplasmic tin-types 
go to the juncture where Blue Grace Glass is raped 
            at the Court of Miracles, Mexico City, 1959

Blue Grace undressed
reveals tattoo marks of Hamburg, sea & storm of 
                                        Neptune-Pluto conjunction 
Rumors of war
strafe the automation monster 
walking to universal assassination 
K & K and the russian poets 
suck Blue Grace’s opulent morsels, back & front 
The nicotine heaven of Bosch’s painting 
emanates the thousand beauties of
            Christopher Maclaine’s tool box 
of mechanical brass jewels
                                                  Man,
                                                  the marvel 
                                                  of masturbation arts, 
                                     intersects Blue Grace 
              at World’s Finale Orgasm Electro-Physic Apocalypse !

I sing the beauty of bodily touch 
with my muse, Blue Grace


Spring 1963

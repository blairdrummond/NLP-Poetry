title : Military Mind

author : Charlie Smith

I wanted to go to military school   
and march, I wanted to grow up   
and be composed and expert   
with a rifle, with tactics and fighting,   
to be safe and courageous among men   
in barracks and on the battlefield.   
I wanted to see my arms hairy and   
corded with muscle at the end of rolled up khaki sleeves.   
I wanted to flex my feet in boots and   
look down at the the dust of battles   
dimming the leather surfaces, the blood slick   
on the rim of the soles. I wanted   
the smell of gunpowder in my nostrils, the grime   
on my face, the washed-out hollow   
love for my comrades found in the foxholes,   
the sad understanding, the requiems   
of late afternoons walking away from the burial site   
with the widow as she cradled the triangulated flag   
like a plowblade in her arms.

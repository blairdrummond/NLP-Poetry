text : 
My father and I lie down together. 
He is dead. 

We look up at the stars, the steady sound 
Of the wind turning the night like a ceiling fan. 
This is our home. 

I remember the work in him 
Like bitterness in persimmons before a frost. 
And I imagine the way he had fear, 
The ground turning dark in a rain. 

Now he gets up. 

And I dream he looks down in my eyes 
And watches me die.

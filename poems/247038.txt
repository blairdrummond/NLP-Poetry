title : Darkness Starts

author : Christian Wiman

text : 
A shadow in the shape of a house
 slides out of a house
 and loses its shape on the lawn.

 Trees seek each other
 as the wind within them dies.

 Darkness starts inside of things
 but keeps on going when the things are gone.

 Barefoot careless in the farthest parts of the yard 
children become their cries.

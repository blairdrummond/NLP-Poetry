title : The Fall Returns

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
the rooms are chosen, then they move on
 the beads are wetted in the lime
 the weedlot boils in the blood of one eye
 the children first are cankered then they spin
  

 there are not routes, only dials
 the rocks are spun together in one ball
 the laundry is of rust, the pillow shrieks
 pianos all blow northward and return

 
 must be a bath if  I could find it is a map
 of all the ways that center intermission
 skulls are simply caps for all compression
 day’s light raising closets for its dark

 
 I put up the clothes and trail the keys
 that onyx knob in vacuum turns the train
 pressure on the pitches swaying back again
 a world without a heartbeat but it stays

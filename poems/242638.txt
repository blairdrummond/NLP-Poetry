title : Song for Baby-O, Unborn

author : Diane di Prima

text : 
Sweetheart
when you break thru
you’ll find
a poet here
not quite what one would choose.

I won’t promise
you’ll never go hungry
or that you won’t be sad
on this gutted
breaking 
globe

but I can show you
baby
enough to love
to break your heart
forever

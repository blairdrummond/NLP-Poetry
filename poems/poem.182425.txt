A Translation for Robert Jones
A diamond 
Is there 
At the heart of the moon or the branches or my nakedness 
And there is nothing in the universe like diamond 
Nothing in the whole mind. 

The poem is a seagull resting on a pier at the end of the ocean. 

A dog howls at the moon 
A dog howls at the branches 
A dog howls at the nakedness 
A dog howling with pure mind. 

I ask for the poem to be as pure as a seagull's belly. 

The universe falls apart and discloses a diamond 
Two words called seagull are peacefully floating out where the 
       waves are. 
The dog is dead there with the moon, with the branches, with 
       my nakedness 
And there is nothing in the universe like diamond 
Nothing in the whole mind.

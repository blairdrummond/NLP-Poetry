title : The Window

author : Diane di Prima

text : 
you are my bread
and the hairline 
noise
of my bones
you are almost 
the sea

you are not stone
or molten sound
I think
you have no hands



this kind of bird flies backward
and this love
breaks on a windowpane
where no light talks

this is not time
for crossing tongues
(the sand here
never shifts)



I think 
tomorrow
turned you with his toe
and you will
shine
and shine
unspent and underground

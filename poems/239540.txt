Water spurts incredibly
 Clear up under simple feel
 And that is how
 We drank water
  
 A loon fled
 Into water
 Because a raven
 Could not dive
 Or swim. Only spinning is a star
 Dizziness       simple
 Ceremony appeasing weather
 With you sky, with for you sky
 Between
 A feeling a sky
 Heartfelt redolent in June
 Roses fume. May day
 Perpetual field of velvet horizon
 At a slant is the unicorn’s mane
 Realization from seed to flower
 We made contact chalices
 Filled, a sticky sweet
 Rim
  
 Oenone in layers tissue white
 Garb blooming staunchly
 Against salt caking waves
 Tosses the self
 Secret she has into the sea
 A volume into silence
 Liquid shadow engulfing liquid
 Ruin. Dumbess as condition
 Obsolete
 In generalization
 Sea flowers join
 Her hair. A music hummed
 In the mind otherwise mute
 In sedge hats we walk along pulling
 Iris and water oats for our vases
  
 Lysistrata’s cool
 Logical edge
 Lance leaved
 Golden 
 Rod
 Linear leaves
 Untoothed edges
  
 Note the fringed beards
 And the relatively short
 Spurs on this deep yellow
 Orange species. Spur
 Shorter than that deeply
 Fringed lip. Sepals rounded
 And curved inward. Thickets

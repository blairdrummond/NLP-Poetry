title : from Step

author : George Albon

text : 
a perfect world
a trail widens out the
code of indents

channels serving
both prey and 
interpreters

arms back, re-
laxed nerves as 
in a vat





a perfect world
placed hand on
the breathing field

the choices are circled
until so dark they
must be chosen over

someone in estranged
weather passed past
“these doors don’t”

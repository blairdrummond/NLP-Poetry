breath, 
life after seven decades plus three years 
is a lot of breathing. seventy three years on this 
earth is a lot of taking in and giving out, is a 
life of coming from somewhere and for many a bunch 
of going nowhere. 

how do we celebrate a poet who has created 
music with words for over fifty years, who has 
showered magic on her people, who has redefined 
poetry into a black world exactness 
thereby giving the universe an insight into 
darkroads? 

just say she interprets beauty and wants to 
give life, say she is patient with phoniness 
and doesn’t mind people calling her gwen or sister. 
say she sees the genius in our children, is visionary 
about possibilities, sees as clearly as ray charles and 
stevie wonder, hears like determined elephants looking 
for food. say that her touch is fine wood, her memory 
is like an african roadmap detailing adventure and 
clarity, yet returning to chicago’s south evans 
to record the journey. say her voice is majestic 
and magnetic as she speaks in poetry, rhythms, song 
and spirited trumpets, say she is dark skinned, 
melanin rich, small-boned, hurricane-willed, 
with a mind like a tornado redefining the landscape. 

life after seven decades plus three years 
is a lot of breathing. 
gwendolyn, gwen, sister g has 
not disappointed our expectations. 
in the middle 
of her eldership she brings us 
vigorous language, memory, 
illumination. 

she brings breath.

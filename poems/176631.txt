title : A Certain Village

author : Theodore Weiss

text : 
Once in late summer, 
the road already deep in twilight,   
mixing colors with some straggly   
wildflowers, I came to a village   
I did not know was there 
                                     until 
I stepped into its narrow street.   
Admiring the prim, white houses   
nestled among their veteran,   
lofty trees, 
                   I found myself in 
a tiny square with a little dawdl- 
ing fountain and a rickety tower,   
its owlish clock absentmindedly   
counting minutes now and then. 

And in the fountain the face   
of morning seemed to linger as   
though searching. The air was fresh,   
breathing out the fragrances   
of a recent shower. 
                              I luxuriated 
in my senses, like meeting   
unexpectedly a pack of friends   
years and years unthought of, laden   
with all kinds of gifts. 
                                     Then 
as I stopped to knock at the door 
of a house that had seemed occupied   
with happy noises, a silence   
fell on it, 
                  the light went out— 
and was it instant eyes like flakes,   
ten thousand, thousand flakes,   
and all unknowing, flurried   
round me? 
               Wherever I turned   
I was met by the unmistakable   
accusation, “Stranger!” I, who had, 
I thought, begun here and who now   
required lodgings 
                           for the night,   
was denied and from the start.

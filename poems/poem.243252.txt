Rhymed Stanza

How lovely is thy dwelling,
 Great god, to whom all greatness is belonging!
        To view thy courts far, far from any telling
 My soul doth long and pine with longing
                  Unto the God that liveth,
                  The God that all life giveth,
        My heart and body both aspire,
        Above delight, beyond desire.
  
        Alas, the sparrow knoweth
 The house where free and fearless she resideth;
        Directly to the nest the swallow goeth,
 Where with her sons she safe abideth.
                 Oh, altars thine, most mighty
                  In war, yea, most almighty:
        Thy altars, Lord, ah, why should I
        From altars thine excluded lie?
  
        Oh, happy who remaineth
 Thy household-man and still thy praise unfoldeth!
        Oh, happy who himself on thee sustaineth,
 Who to thy house his journey holdeth!
                  Me seems I see them going
                  Where mulberries are growing:
        How wells they dig in thirsty plain,
        And cisterns make for falling rain.
  
        Me seems I see augmented
 Still troop with troop, till all at length discover
        Zion, where to their sight is represented
 The Lord of hosts, the Zion lover.
                  O Lord, O God, most mighty
                  In war, yea, most almighty:
        Hear what I beg; hearken, I say,
        O Jacob's God, to what I pray.
  
        Thou art the shield us shieldeth:
 Then, Lord, behold the face of thine anointed
        One day spent in thy courts more comfort yieldeth
 Than thousands otherwise appointed.
                  I count it clearer pleasure
                  To spend my age's treasure
        Waiting a porter at thy gates
        Than dwell a lord with wicked mates.
  
        Thou art the sun that shineth;
 Thou art the buckler, Lord that us defendeth:
        Glory and grace Jehovah's hand assigneth
 And good without refusal sendeth
                  To him who truly treadeth
                  The path to pureness leadeth.
        O Lord of might, thrice blessed he
        Whose confidence is built on thee.

title : Dressing My Daughters

One girl a full head taller 
Than the other—into their Sunday dresses.   
First, the slip, hardly a piece of fabric,   
Softly stitched and printed with a bud. 
I’m not their mother, and tangle, then untangle   
The whole cloth—on backwards, have to grab it   
Round their necks. But they know how to pull   
Arms in, a reflex of being dressed, 
And also, a child’s faith. The mass of stuff   
That makes the Sunday frocks collapses 
In my hands and finds its shape, only because   
They understand the drape of it— 
These skinny keys to intricate locks.   
The buttons are a problem 
For a surgeon. How would she connect   
These bony valves and stubborn eyelets? 
The filmy dress revolves in my blind fingers.   
The slots work one by one. 
And when they’re put together, 
Not like puppets or those doll-saints   
That bring tears to true believers, 
But living children, somebody’s real daughters,   
They do become more real. 
They say, “Stop it!” and “Give it back!”   
And “I don’t want to!” They’ll kiss 
A doll’s hard features, whispering, 
“I’m sorry.” I know just why my mother   
Used to worry. Your clothes don’t keep   
You close—it’s nakedness. 
Clad in my boots and holster, 
I would roam with my six-gun buddies. 
We dealt fake death to one another, 
Fell and rolled in filth and rose, 
Grimy with wounds, then headed home. 
But Sunday ... what was that tired explanation   
Given for wearing clothes that 
Scratched and shone and weighed like a slow hour?   
That we should shine—in gratitude. 
So, I give that explanation, undressing them,   
And wait for the result. 
After a day like Sunday, such a long one, 
When they lie down, half-dead, 
To be undone, they won’t help me. 
They cry, “It’s not my fault.”

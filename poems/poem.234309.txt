                            I

Why should you sweare I am forsworn,
   Since thine I vow'd to be?
Lady it is already Morn,
   And 'twas last night I swore to thee
That fond impossibility.

                            II

Have I not lov'd thee much and long,
   A tedious twelve houres space?
I must all other Beauties wrong,
   And rob thee of a new imbrace;
Could I still dote upon thy Face.

                            III

Not, but all joy in thy browne haire,
   By others may be found;
But I must search the blank and faire
   Like skilfull Minerallist's that sound
For Treasure in un-plow'd-up ground.

                            IV

Then, if when I have lov'd my round,
   Thou prov'st the pleasant she;
With spoyles of meaner Beauties crown'd,
   I laden will returne to thee,
Ev'd sated with Varietie.

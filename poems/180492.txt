title : The Snowbound City

author : John Haines

text : 
I believe in this stalled magnificence, 
this churning chaos of traffic, 
a beast with broken spine, 
its hoarse voice hooded in feathers 
and mist; the baffled eyes 
wink amber and slowly darken. 

Of men and women suddenly walking, 
stumbling with little sleighs 
in search of Tibetan houses â€” 
dust from a far-off mountain 
already whitens their shoulders. 

When evening falls in blurred heaps, 
a man losing his way among churches 
and schoolyards feels under his cold hand 
the stone thoughts of that city, 

impassable to all but a few children 
who went on into the hidden life 
of caves and winter fires, 
their faces glowing with disaster.

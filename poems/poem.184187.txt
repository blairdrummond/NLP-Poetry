To His Watch, When He Could Not Sleep 
Lord Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury 
1583-1648
17th Century
England
Time & Brevity, Living, Death



Uncessant Minutes, whil'st you move you tell
   The time that tells our life, which though it run
   Never so fast or farr, you'r new begun
Short steps shall overtake; for though life well

May scape his own Account, it shall not yours,
   You are Death's Auditors, that both divide
And summ what ere that life inspir'd endures
   Past a beginning, and through you we bide

The doom of Fate, whose unrecall'd Decree
   You date, bring, execute; making what's new
   Ill and good, old, for as we die in you,
You die in Time, Time in Eternity.

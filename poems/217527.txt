I make the drive, walk the corporate walk, 
To do what I must and give what I got. 
I turn the chrome knob and I fill my slot. 
I talk and I joke, a regular guy 
I input and output and rarely ask why. 

It's pasta and wine at home in my flat. 
It's voice mail and e-mail, then feed the stray cat. 
Sometimes I go out and chat up the girls. 
Some want to tango, some manage a smile. 
Some come home and have safe sex for a while. 

My sweet IRA, my 401-k, 
Let me buy tickets to games, to a play— 
I go with the gang and don't get involved. 
I fly to St. Croix and stare at the sea. 
I travel first class. No day-tripper me. 

My stocks are diverse to ride out the storm. 
I buy what is solid, hew to the norm. 
My portfolio teaches how I should vote. 
I'm cautious in style, suspicious of trend. 
When weather turns foul I always come in. 

This is my choice, my new BoBo life. 
A two-career marriage, the tension, the strife— 
It didn't last long. We parted as pals. 
She got the condo. I got the car. 
She's a savvy, cool chick. She'll go really far. 

My folks live upstate, where I misspent my youth. 
They're tight with their money and long in the tooth. 
When I visit it's hard with so little to say. 
They miss me, they claim. They worry. They pray. 
But they seem relieved when I drive away.

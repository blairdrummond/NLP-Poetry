The survey says all groups can make more money 
if they lose weight except black men...men of other colors 
and women of all colors have more gold, but black men 
are the summary of weight, a lead thick thing on the scales, 
meters spinning until they ring off the end of the numbering 
of accumulation, how things grow heavy, fish on the 
ends of lines that become whales, then prehistoric sea life 
beyond all memories, the billion days of human hands 
working, doing all the labor one can imagine, hands 
now the population of cactus leaves on a papyrus moon 
waiting for the fire, the notes from all their singing gone 
up into the salt breath of tears of children that dry, rise 
up to be the crystalline canopy of promises, the infinite 
gone fishing days with the apologies for not being able to love 
anymore, gone down inside earth somewhere where 
women make no demands, have fewer dreams of forever, 
these feet that marched and ran and got cut off, these hearts 
torn out of chests by nameless thieves, this thrashing 
until the chaff is gone out and black men know the gold 
of being the dead center of things, where pain is the gateway 
to Jerusalems, Bodhi trees, places for meditation and howling, 
keeping the weeping heads of gods in their eyes.

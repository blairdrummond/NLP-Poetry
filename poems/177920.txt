title : My Sad Captains

author : Thom Gunn

text : 
One by one they appear in 
the darkness: a few friends, and   
a few with historical 
names. How late they start to shine!   
but before they fade they stand   
perfectly embodied, all 

the past lapping them like a   
cloak of chaos. They were men   
who, I thought, lived only to   
renew the wasteful force they   
spent with each hot convulsion.   
They remind me, distant now. 

True, they are not at rest yet,   
but now that they are indeed   
apart, winnowed from failures,   
they withdraw to an orbit 
and turn with disinterested   
hard energy, like the stars.

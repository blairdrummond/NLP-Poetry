title : Openin’ Night

author : Shel Silverstein

text : 
She had the jitters
 She had the flu
 She showed up late
 She missed her cue
 She kicked the director
 She screamed at the crew
 And tripped on a prop
 And fell in some goo
 And ripped her costume
 A place or two
 Then she forgot
 A line she knew
 And went “Meow”
 Instead of “Moo”
 She heard ‘em giggle
 She heard ‘em boo
 The programs sailed
 The popcorn flew
 As she stomped offstage
 With a boo-hoo-hoo
 The fringe of the curtain
 Got caught in her shoe
 The set crashed down
 The lights did too
 Maybe that’s why she didn’t want to do
 An interview.

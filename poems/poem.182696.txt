'How can the red men be forgotten, while so many of our states and territories, bays, lakes, and rivers, are indelibly stamped by names of their giving?'
Ye say they all have passed away, 
   That noble race and brave, 
That their light canoes have vanished 
   From off the crested wave; 
That 'mid the forests where they roamed 
   There rings no hunter shout, 
But their name is on your waters, 
   Ye may not wash it out. 

'Tis where Ontario's billow 
   Like Ocean's surge is curled, 
Where strong Niagara's thunders wake 
   The echo of the world. 
Where red Missouri bringeth 
   Rich tribute from the west, 
And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps 
   On green Virginia's breast. 

Ye say their cone-like cabins, 
   That clustered o'er the vale, 
Have fled away like withered leaves 
   Before the autumn gale, 
But their memory liveth on your hills, 
   Their baptism on your shore, 
Your everlasting rivers speak 
   Their dialect of yore. 

Old Massachusetts wears it, 
   Within her lordly crown, 
And broad Ohio bears it, 
   Amid his young renown; 
Connecticut hath wreathed it 
   Where her quiet foliage waves, 
And bold Kentucky breathed it hoarse 
   Through all her ancient caves. 

Wachuset hides its lingering voice 
   Within his rocky heart, 
And Alleghany graves its tone 
   Throughout his lofty chart; 
Monadnock on his forehead hoar 
   Doth seal the sacred trust, 
Your mountains build their monument, 
   Though ye destroy their dust. 

Ye call these red-browned brethren 
   The insects of an hour, 
Crushed like the noteless worm amid 
   The regions of their power; 
Ye drive them from their father's lands, 
   Ye break of faith the seal, 
But can ye from the court of Heaven   
   Exclude their last appeal? 

Ye see their unresisting tribes, 
   With toilsome step and slow, 
On through the trackless desert pass 
   A caravan of woe; 
Think ye the Eternal's ear is deaf? 
   His sleepless vision dim? 
Think ye the soul's blood may not cry 
   From that far land to him?

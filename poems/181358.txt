title : The Dow Is Off

author : Norman Williams

text : 
Southbound, downwardly mobile in 
A knocking ten-year-old LeSabre, 
Totaled once and salvaged, rust 
Gnawing at the rocker panels like 
Fire at the curtains in a melodrama, 
I imagine those for whom such news 
Must matter: sauve, smooth-featured types, 
Untroubled by the odd details 
Of racing forms or powerball, 
Who, while I drove truck or counted stock, 
Were wisely planning their estates, 
Diversifying portfolios, or buying 
A summer place with acreage. 

Yet how their evening now is shot! 
How flat the chardonnay, how bland 
The tips of tenderloin must taste! 
Of course, it’s not the Dow alone— 
The dollar’s through the roof, T-bills 
Have plunged, and, even now, the wife 
Is pussyfooting at the club. 
How birdsong-sweet and full of joy 
Seems my life by comparison: 
The Gulf’s two hours off, where rigs 
Pound at the solar plexus of 
The earth, and where, on moonlit nights, 
Perfumed mulattoes weave like snails 
By the shore, leaving shining trails.

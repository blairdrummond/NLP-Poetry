text : 
somebody coming in blackness
 like a star
 and the world be a great bush
 on his head
 and his eyes be fire
 in the city
 and his mouth be true as time
  
 he be calling the people brother
 even in the prison
 even in the jail
  
 i’m just only a baptist preacher
 somebody bigger than me coming
 in blackness like a star

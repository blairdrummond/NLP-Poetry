greetings
 as the door opened
 ticking
  
 please listen to this
 food alone for all 
 the f.b.i. will continue
  
 maybe you dozed off 
 i hung by that phone all night
 suppose he talks
  
 *
  
 vida
  
 later
  
 aria
  
 *
  
 once upon a time
 not looking for any thing
  
 *
  
 you’re on
 your own
 it’s off
 it’s on
  
 *
  
 perhaps it means
 ragged like that
 golda my-yeer
          pre-meer
  
 *
  
 and pour the old box
 down a drain
  
 *
  
 too  much news
 said the news
  
 *
  
 r e  o l e
  
 *
  
 it’s us
 or rust
 listener
  
 *
  
 deep
  
 personal
  
 regret
  
 looking
  
 up
  
 monday
  
 *
  
 we can save
 your head or your body
 we can shave
  
 *
  
 even 
 his admission
 is 
 a subtle lie
  
 *
  
 in suspense
 what is cut into
 the smallest of the
  
 *
  
 grinding
  
 to fill
  
 a prescription
  
 *
  
 drum to the wobble and a roll on the sea
 come to mind an article of light
 distance through distance unfinished
  
 *
  
 piano
  
 *
  
 willing to believe
  
 *
  
 national
  
 anthem
  
 hearer
  
 *
  
perfect rhyme to some
  
 all cars
  
 kept in doors
  
 *
  
 sophisticated
 newsmen
 show how
 it could have been
  
 *
 retreat
 from the swiss
 legation
  
 *
  
 numbers 
 for an event
  
 *
  
 corruption
 why not?
  
 *
  
 infinite
  
 detail
  
 is no more real
  
 *
  
 thought
  
              against
  
                           power
  
 *
  
 answer
  
  
 it
  
 *
  
 hooked 
 to just another
 piece of tape
 hooked 
 to just one more 
 little piece of tape
  
 *
  
 through words in to 
 no 
 record
  
  
 *
  
 writer
  
 righter
  
 riter
  
 *
  
 am:
  
 i
  
 on replay?
  
 *
  
 all you 
 do is 
 expand
 the system
  
 *
  
 a polaroid
 of la
 with the wrong
 voice print

 astronaut
 amazed
 at what 
was expected

text : 
Driving through   
hot brushy country 
the late autumn,   
I saw a hawk 
crucified on a 
barbed-wire fence. 

I guess as a kind   
of advertisement   
to other hawks,   
saying from the pages 
of a leading women’s   
   magazine, 

“She’s beautiful, 
but burn all the maps   
to your body. 
I’m not here 
of my own choosing.”

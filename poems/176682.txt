title : Champs d’Honneur

author : Ernest M. Hemingway

text : 
Soldiers never do die well; 
         Crosses mark the places— 
Wooden crosses where they fell, 
         Stuck above their faces. 
Soldiers pitch and cough and twitch— 
         All the world roars red and black; 
Soldiers smother in a ditch, 
         Choking through the whole attack.

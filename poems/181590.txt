title : The Approaches

author : Harry Clifton

text : 
A childless, futureless road 
And then nothing. . . Is that it? 
Or start believing in a God 
Beyond the temporal limit 

Of westering skies, wide, melancholy, 
Uncut fields and paced-out walls 
As we drive towards it slowly, 
The house that has us both in thrall. 

They are gone, now, the hours of light 
It took to get here. Might-have-beens, 
Lost wanderyears. But that's alright— 
We are trading it in, the seen 

For the experienced, the car keys 
For the end of the journey, 
When distances have lost their power 
And the heart beats slower 

In tomorrow's cold, a coming weather 
One degree north of yesterday. 
High latitudes—as they say, 
There is nothing up here 

But wind and silence, passing clouds, 
Light diminished half a tone, 
A dish left out all night for the gods 
By morning turned to stone. 

So take a right, go down two gears 
And stay in second, where the church is 
And the pig farm. Only the approaches 
Are terrible, only the years, 

The getting here, which takes forever. 
A boy in tears, a barren crone 
On a bicycle, a man alone— 
They're waving. . . It's now or never 

For the final self, I assume— 
For the shape of the house 
On the skyline, the release 
Into childhood, and the coming home.

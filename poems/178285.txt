title : My Son the Man

Suddenly his shoulders get a lot wider, 
the way Houdini would expand his body 
while people were putting him in chains. It seems 
no time since I would help him to put on his sleeper, 
guide his calves into the gold interior, 
zip him up and toss him up and 
catch his weight. I cannot imagine him 
no longer a child, and I know I must get ready, 
get over my fear of men now my son 
is going to be one. This was not 
what I had in mind when he pressed up through me like a 
sealed trunk through the ice of the Hudson, 
snapped the padlock, unsnaked the chains, 
and appeared in my arms. Now he looks at me 
the way Houdini studied a box 
to learn the way out, then smiled and let himself be manacled.

title : The Memory of Barbarism is the Recollection of Virtue

Perhaps, when we the strangers in the bar’s blue light   
   turn liberal, you’d claim fraternity 
or clan and say Detroit is turned American 
   by the community of appetite. 

There was this hurried time of fear of the last bell,   
   our sure prognostication it would be 
somber so soon to face a sky of December 
   that impended on the light blue snow swell, 

when someone turned and told of Caucasian wheat fields,   
   the harvest sun, a last effrontery. 
His father decapitates their Turkish master. 
   The village is invested. No one yields. 

Then, you may know, the last round came, and with it pride.   
   I swivelled round to face my own whiskey 
recalling anecdotes in turn of ancestral 
   snowfields and running wolves and fireside.

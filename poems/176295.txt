title : Caterpillars

author : Brod Bagert

text : 
They came like dewdrops overnight 
Eating every plant in sight, 
Those nasty worms with legs that crawl 
So creepy up the garden wall, 
Green prickly fuzz to hurt and sting 
Each unsuspecting living thing. 
How I hate them!   Oh, you know 
I’d love to squish them with my toe. 
But then I see past their disguise, 
Someday they’ll all be butterflies.

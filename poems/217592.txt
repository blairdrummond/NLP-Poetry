title : Mapping the Genome

author : Michael Symmons Roberts

text : 
Geneticist as driver, down the gene 
codes in, let's say, a topless coupe 
and you keep expecting bends, 

real tyre-testers on tight 
mountain passes, but instead it's dead 
straight, highway as runway, 

helix unravelled as vista, 
as vanishing point. Keep your foot 
down. This is a finite desert. 

You move too fast to read it, 
the order of the rocks, the cacti, 
roadside weeds, a blur to you. 

Every hour or so, you pass a shack 
which passes for a motel here: 
tidy faded rooms with TVs on 

for company, the owner pacing out 
his empty parking lot. And after 
each motel you hit a sandstorm 

thick as fog, but agony. 
Somewhere out there are remnants 
of our evolution, genes for how 

to fly south, sense a storm, 
hunt at night, how to harden 
your flesh into hide or scales. 

These are the miles of dead code. 
Every desert has them. 
You are on a mission to discover 

why the human heart still slows 
when divers break the surface, 
why mermaids still swim in our dreams.

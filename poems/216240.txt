title : In a Field Outside the Town

Three days later, Suljic was finally given a drink 
of water and marched with a dozen other men 
onto a small livery truck, one of two, fenced 
along each side by wooden planks, 

the back left open to give a clear shot 
to the automatic weapon poking out the window 
of the red sedan that followed, the squat nose 
trained on them, ridiculously, as if they'd any thought 

of hopping off a moving truck. Suljic peered 
vacantly through the slats. He'd missed the yellow flowers 
of Spring and by now saw a landscape taken over 
by Summer, the grasses closing behind them as they veered 

from the road and lurched across cow paths. They drove 
to the center of a wide field and stopped. Old sweat, 
without the breeze of movement, prickled in the heat. 
A metal smell drifted, an untended apple grove 

baked on a hill, and the weeds droned, motory with bees. 
But Suljic noticed none of these, fixed instead 
on the gaps in the field where bodies, all dead, 
matted down the wild carrot and chicory, their khakis 

splotched darkly, like a fawn's dappled haunches 
obscuring them. The men clambered down into the tall grass 
and lined up at gunpoint. Suljic was sure the last 
good thing he'd ever see would be the apple branches 

drooping with fruit, but the man beside him grabbed 
his hand, and looked him in the face, as if 
Suljic, just a bricklayer, had any assurances to give. 
He squeezed the hand back, hard, and felt a scab 

crossing the man's knuckles. He saw, too, a thin scar 
worrying the arch of his left eyebrow, much older, 
perhaps from a fall as a child from a ladder 
picking fruit. His hand was like a clump of mortar, 

and three nights without sleep had webbed his eyes red. 
And Suljic suddenly stuttered to ask his name, 
what town was he from, his job—anything—but there came 
the crackle, like sometimes thunder, undecided 

whether to begin, that starts, stalls, then trips 
over itself, the sound crinkling from one 
end of the sky to the other. The sound took possession 
of his face until it, too, crinkled, his grip 

pulsed, and he fell forward. Suljic winced 
in the tackle of bodies, and splayed down in the dirt 
flattening himself like a beetle, not hurt 
in any new way, not yet convinced 

he wasn't dead and didn't feel it. He heard the click 
of fresh clips sliding into place, and shut 
his eyes lightly, sure someone had seen he wasn't shot 
and would come finish it. But no one came. Another truck 

rolled up. The men climbed down, and lined up, docilely. 
He recognized, solely by rhythm, a prayer, cut off 
by the crackle, the hush of crickets, the soft 
whump of bodies folding at the knees 

and knocked by bullets shoulder first 
into the grass. No one yelled. No one tried to run. 
Another truck, another group, falling like a succession 
of bricks sliding off a hod. Suljic finally pissed 

where he lay, and blended in all the better 
with the others. The noise stopped, and he cracked 
his eyes enough to see, across the backs 
like bleeding hills, a man strolling along the scatter 

of bodies with a pistol, putting a slug 
into the skull of anyone that still twitched 
or mumbled. Then came the snort and low-pitched 
rumble of diesel engines as two backhoes dug 

a trench along the margin of all the collapsed 
bodies. Impossibly, the crackling started anew, 
and when darkness finally settled, the squads continued 
in what light the backhoes' headlights threw. Perhaps 

the shooting was over long before the sound 
left him, the crackle to his eardrums 
was like the rolling of a boat to his limbs 
echoing long after he'd reached dry ground. 

The soldiers left. Still he didn't move, but eased 
his eyes full open. The moon above the orchard 
was shrinking higher, its light glossing the awkward 
pale forms that stubbled the dry weeds, 

glinting off teeth and eyes. He scuttled from beneath 
the arms and legs flopped sleepingly over 
his own, as though by drunkards or lovers, 
and rose like a foal to his numb feet, 

seeing throughout the field no man not touched 
by three dead others. He stood for a moment, trying 
to guess, even roughly, their number, multiplying 
bodies per square yard, but the math was too much, 

the count too huge. He stared at the faces beside him 
in the grass, like a man leaving something he knew 
he would someday have to return to, 
looking for the landmarks that would guide him— 

the crooked teeth, the welted cheek, the pale eyes eclipsed 
by half-shut lids, lolling upward, inward, swollen 
as though with weeping, blood from an unseen hole 
glistering down a chin line, crusting on lips. 

How could he explain his life, what could he say 
to those who weren't here to see, to the mothers and wives 
who'd swear for years their men were still alive, 
somewhere, the bodies never found, bulldozed into clay— 

would he tell them how he tiptoed, unable to avoid 
stepping on hands and ankles, or how the tears 
like a secret he'd harbored through three years 
of siege shook loose, and how he let them, no longer afraid 

of being found out and cut down by gunfire, 
or how he ran anyway, when he reached the open, quick 
as his bum leg would let him, without a look 
back at the faces turned like gourds in the dark mire.

title : American Wedding

text : 
In america,
I place my ring 
on your cock 
where it belongs.
No horsemen 
bearing terror, 
no soldiers of doom
will swoop in 
and sweep us apart.
They’re too busy 
looting the land 
to watch us.
They don’t know 
we need each other 
critically.
They expect us to call in sick, 
watch television all night,
die by our own hands. 
They don’t know 
we are becoming powerful. 
Every time we kiss 
we confirm the new world coming.

What the rose whispers
before blooming
I vow to you.
I give you my heart, 
a safe house. 
I give you promises other than
milk, honey, liberty.
I assume you will always
be a free man with a dream.
In america,
place your ring
on my cock 
where it belongs.
Long may we live
to free this dream.

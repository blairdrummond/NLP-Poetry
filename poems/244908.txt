Homo sapiens is the only species to suffer psychological exile.         —E. O. Wilson
I returned to a stand of pines,
                             bone-thin phalanx
  
 flanking the roadside, tangle
                             of understory—a dialectic of dark
  
 and light—and magnolias blossoming
                             like afterthought: each flower
  
 a surrender, white flags draped
                             among the branches. I returned
  
 to land’s end, the swath of coast
                             clear cut and buried in sand:
  
 mangrove, live oak, gulfweed
                             razed and replaced by thin palms—
  
 palmettos—symbols of victory
                             or defiance, over and over
  
 marking this vanquished land. I returned
                             to a field of cotton, hallowed ground—
  
 as slave legend goes—each boll
                             holding the ghosts of generations:
  
 those who measured their days
                             by the heft of sacks and lengths
  
 of rows, whose sweat flecked the cotton plants
                             still sewn into our clothes.
  
 I returned to a country battlefield
                             where colored troops fought and died—
  
 Port Hudson where their bodies swelled
                             and blackened beneath the sun—unburied
  
 until earth’s green sheet pulled over them,
                             unmarked by any headstones.
  
 Where the roads, buildings, and monuments
                             are named to honor the Confederacy,
  
 where that old flag still hangs, I return
                             to Mississippi, state that made a crime
  
 of me—mulatto, half-breed—native
                             in my native land, this place they’ll bury me.

Common Measure

Success is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed. 
To comprehend a nectar 
Requires sorest need. 

Not one of all the purple Host 
Who took the Flag today 
Can tell the definition 
So clear of victory 

As he defeated - dying - 
On whose forbidden ear 
The distant strains of triumph 
Burst agonized and clear!

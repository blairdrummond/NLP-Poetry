title : To the Sour Reader

author : Robert Herrick

text : 
If thou dislik’st the piece thou light’st on first, 
Think that of all that I have writ the worst; 
But if thou read’st my book unto the end, 
And still dost this and that verse reprehend, 
O perverse man! If all disgustful be, 
The extreme scab take thee and thine, for me.

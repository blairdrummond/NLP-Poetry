An inch from the curse and pearled 
by the evening heat       I shake 
my polo neck and a cool draught 
buffs my chest. What rises is 
my animal aroma             the scent 
of blue-ribbon stock      the sort 
a starred chef would ladle from 
a zinc-bottomed pan    to soften   
and savor the hock he has sawn   
and roasted for the diners out front   
who sip at shots of pastis and gnaw   
around the pits of kalamata olives.   
                                                          My head 
sits in his fridge: stooping for herb 
butter, our eyes meet and he touches 
my cotton-cold face      just as once 
I stroked your cheek in a dream 
you suffered in a room above the river.

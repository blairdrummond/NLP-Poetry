Persona

Out of me unworthy and unknown 
The vibrations of deathless music; 
"With malice toward none, with charity for all." 
Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions, 
And the beneficent face of a nation 
Shining with justice and truth. 
I am Anne Rutledge who sleep beneath these weeds, 
Beloved in life of Abraham Lincoln, 
Wedded to him, not through union, 
But through separation. 
Bloom forever, O Republic, 
From the dust of my bosom!

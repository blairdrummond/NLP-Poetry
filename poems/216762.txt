title : Un citadin / A City Dweller

author : Jacques Réda

text : 
The street I walk along I often see   
As if I'd long since left the moving surface   
Of the world for the endless other side that disperses   
Us all some day without return but free   

Of care. I apply myself so well to this fragile proceeding   
That very quickly my gaze ceases to be   
Part of the cloudy clump of hope and memory   
I'll have given my name to. But for this to succeed,   

A feeling of absolute happiness has to make   
Itself felt, as if from outside me, so much   
That at that moment the very street has a hunch   
That it, the entire city, and its uncertain space   

Have become one with the mobile but faithful pattern   
Of phrases written by our steps when we move about.   
I no longer know who's walking and marking out   
The ground, bit by bit, to the corner. My gaze then patterns   

Itself on tomorrow's unknown eyes, which will shine   
When from the roofs, posthumous and vague, mine glow,   
And my invisible trace on the asphalt below    
Might guide the élan of hardier passersby.   

Will they know what I sometimes suspect: what appears   
To be the distracted gaze with which we see   
The world is the world itself?—It sees and hears   
Itself through the thin transparency of our screens.

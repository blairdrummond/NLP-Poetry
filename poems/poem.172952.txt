Ballad

The castle clock had tolled midnight:
      With mattock and with spade,
And silent, by the torchesa?? light,
      His corse in earth we laid.

   The coffin bore his name, that those
      Of other years might know,
When earth its secrets should disclose,
      Whose bones were laid below.

   a??Peace to the deada?? no children sung,
      Slow pacing up the nave,a??
No prayers were read, no knell was rung,
      As deep we dug his grave.

   We only heard the winter's wind,
      In many a sullen gust,
As, oa??er the open grave inclined,
      We murmured, a??Dust to dust!a??

   A moonbeam from the archa??s height
      Streamed, as we placed the stone;
The long aisles started into light,
      And all the windows shone.

   We thought we saw the banners then,
      That shook along the walls,
Whilst the sad shades of mailA?d men
      Were gazing on the stalls.

   a??Tis gone! again on tombs defaced
      Sits darkness more profound;
And only by the torch we traced
      The shadows on the ground.

   And now the chilling, freezing air
      Without blew long and loud;
Upon our knees we breathed one prayer,
      Where he slept in his shroud.

   We laid the broken marble floor,a??
      No name, no trace appears,a??
And when we closed the sounding door,
      We thought of him with tears.

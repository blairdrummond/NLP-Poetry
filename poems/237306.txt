Australia. Phillip Island. The Tasman Sea. 
Dusk. The craggy coastline at low tide in fog. 
Two thousand tourists milling in the stands 
as one by one, and then in groups, the fairy penguins 
mass up on the sand like so much sea wrack and 
debris. And then, as on command, the improbable 
parade begins: all day they've been out fishing 
for their chicks, and now, somehow, they find them 
squawking in their burrows in the dunes, one by one, 
two by two, such comical solemnity, as wobbling by 
they catch our eager eyes until we're squawking, too, 
in English, French, and Japanese, Yiddish and Swahili, 
like some happy wedding party brought to tears   
by whatever in the ceremony repairs the rifts 
between us. The rain stops. The fog lifts. Stars. 
And we go home, less hungry, satisfied, to friends 
and family, regurgitating all we've heard and seen.

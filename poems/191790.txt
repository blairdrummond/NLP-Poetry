title : End of the Comedy

author : Louis Untermeyer

text : 
Eleven oâ€™clock, and the curtain falls.
The cold wind tears the strands of illusion; 
The delicate music is lost
In the blare of home-going crowds
And a midnight paper.

The night has grown martial;
It meets us with blows and disaster. 
Even the stars have turned shrapnel, 
Fixed in silent explosions.
And here at our door 
The moonlight is laid 
Like a drawn sword.

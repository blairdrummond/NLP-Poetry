title : Minuscule Things

author : William Matthews

text : 
There’s a crack in this glass so fine we can’t see it,   
and in the blue eye of the candleflame’s needle   
there’s a dark fleck, a speck of imperfection 

that could contain, like a microchip, an epic 
treatise on beauty, except it’s in the eye of the beheld.   
And at the base of our glass there’s nothing 

so big as a tiny puddle, but an ooze, a viscous   
patina like liquefied tarnish. It’s like a text 
so short it consists only of the author’s signature, 

which has to stand, like the future, for what might   
have been: a novel, let’s say, thick with ambiguous life.   
Its hero forgets his goal as he nears it, so that it’s 

like rain evaporating in the very sight of parched   
Saharans on the desert floor. There, by chance, he meets   
a thirsty and beautiful woman. What a small world!

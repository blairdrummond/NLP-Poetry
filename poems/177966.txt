title : Buried at Springs

There is a hornet in the room   
and one of us will have to go   
out the window into the late   
August midafternoon sun. I 
won. There is a certain challenge   
in being humane to hornets   
but not much. A launch draws   
two lines of wake behind it   
on the bay like a delta 
with a melted base. Sandy   
billows, or so they look, 
of feathery ripe heads of grass,   
an acid-yellow kind of 
goldenrod glowing or glowering   
in shade. Rocks with rags   
of shadow, washed dust clouts   
that will never bleach. 
It is not like this at all.   
The rapid running of the   
lapping water a hollow knock 
of someone shipping oars:   
it’s eleven years since   
Frank sat at this desk and   
saw and heard it all   
the incessant water the   
immutable crickets only   
not the same: new needles   
on the spruce, new seaweed   
on the low-tide rocks   
other grass and other water   
even the great gold lichen   
on a granite boulder   
even the boulder quite   
literally is not the same 

      II 
A day subtle and suppressed   
in mounds of juniper enfolding   
scratchy pockets of shadow 
while bigness—rocks, trees, a stump— 
stands shadowless in an overcast   
of ripe grass. There is nothing   
but shade, like the boggy depths   
of a stand of spruce, its resonance   
just the thin scream 
of mosquitoes ascending. 
Boats are light lumps on the bay   
stretching past erased islands   
to ocean and the terrible tumble   
and London (“rain persisting”)   
and Paris (“changing to rain”).   
Delicate day, setting the bright 
of a young spruce against the cold 
of an old one hung with unripe cones   
each exuding at its tip 
gum, pungent, clear as a tear,   
a day tarnished and fractured   
as the quartz in the rocks 
of a dulled and distant point,   
a day like a gull passing 
with a slow flapping of wings   
in a kind of lope, without 
breeze enough to shake loose   
the last of the fireweed flowers, 
a faintly clammy day, like wet silk   
stained by one dead branch   
the harsh russet of dried blood.

title : Infidelity

author : Yusef Komunyakaa

text : 
Zeus always introduces himself   
As one who needs stitching   
Back together with kisses.   
Like a rock star in leather 

& sapphires—conflagration 
& a trick of silk falling 
Between lost chances & never   
Again. His disguises are almost 

Mathematical, as Io & Europa   
Pass from their dreams into his.   
This lord of storm clouds 
Is also a sun god crooning desire 

& dalliance in a garden of nymphs. 
Some days, he loves gloxinia, 
& others, craves garlic blooms— 
Hera, Aegina, & Callisto in the same song.

title : Sonnet with a Different Letter at the End of Every Line

author : George Starbuck

text : 
for Helen Vendler
O for a muse of fire, a sack of dough,   
Or both! O promissory notes of woe!   
One time in Santa Fe N.M. 
Ol’ Winfield Townley Scott and I ... But whoa. 

One can exert oneself, ff, 
Or architect a heaven like Rimbaud, 
Or if that seems, how shall I say, de trop,   
One can at least write sonnets, a propos   
Of nothing save the do-re-mi-fa-sol   
Of poetry itself. Is not the row 
Of perfect rhymes, the terminal bon mot,   
Obeisance enough to the Great O? 

“Observe,” said Chairman Mao to Premier Chou,   
“On voyage à Parnasse pour prendre les eaux.   
On voyage comme poisson, incog.”

title : Ars Poetica

author : Archibald MacLeish

text : 
A poem should be palpable and mute   
As a globed fruit, 

Dumb 
As old medallions to the thumb, 

Silent as the sleeve-worn stone 
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown— 

A poem should be wordless   
As the flight of birds. 

                         *               

A poem should be motionless in time   
As the moon climbs, 

Leaving, as the moon releases 
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees, 

Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,   
Memory by memory the mind— 

A poem should be motionless in time   
As the moon climbs. 

                         *               

A poem should be equal to: 
Not true. 

For all the history of grief 
An empty doorway and a maple leaf. 

For love 
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea— 

A poem should not mean   
But be.

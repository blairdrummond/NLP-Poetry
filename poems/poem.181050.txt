Metaphor, Rhymed Stanza

      In this world, the isle of dreams, 
      While we sit by sorrow's streams, 
      Tears and terrors are our themes 
                     Reciting: 

      But when once from hence we fly, 
      More and more approaching nigh 
             Unto young eternity, 
                     Uniting: 

       In that whiter island, where 
       Things are evermore sincere; 
       Candor here and luster there 
                   Delighting: 

    There no monstrous fancies shall 
       Out of hell an horror call, 
       To create, or cause at all, 
                  Affrighting. 

    There, in calm and cooling sleep 
      We our eyes shall never steep, 
       But eternal watch shall keep, 
                   Attending 

    Pleasures, such as shall pursue 
         Me immortalized, and you; 
        And fresh joys, as never too 
                  Have ending.

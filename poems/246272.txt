title : [I rose from marsh mud]

author : Lorine Niedecker

text : 
I rose from marsh mud, 
algae, equisetum, willows,
sweet green, noisy
birds and frogs

to see her wed in the rich
rich silence of the church,
the little white slave-girl
in her diamond fronds.

In aisle and arch
the satin secret collects.
United for life to serve
silver. Possessed.

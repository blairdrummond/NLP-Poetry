title : I’m Glad I’m Me

author : Phil Bolsta

text : 
I don’t understand why everyone stares 
When I take off my clothes and dance down the stairs. 
Or when I stick carrots in both of my ears, 
Then dye my hair green and go shopping at Sears. 
I just love to dress up and do goofy things. 
If I were an angel, I’d tie-dye my wings! 

Why can’t folks accept me the way that I am? 
So what if I’m different and don’t act like them? 
I’m not going to change and be someone I’m not. 
I like who I am, and I’m all that I’ve got.

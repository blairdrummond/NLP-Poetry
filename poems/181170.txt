title : Cocktails with Orpheus

After dark, the bar full of women part of me loves—the part that stood 
naked outside the window of Miss Geneva, recent divorcée who owned 
a gun, O Miss Geneva where are you now—Orpheus says she did 

not perish, she was not turned to ash in the brutal light, she found 
a good job, she made good money, she had her own insurance and 
a house, she was a decent wife. I know descent lives in the word 

decent. The bar noise makes a kind of silence. When Orpheus hands 
me his sunglasses, I see how fire changes everything. In the mind 
I am behind a woman whose skirt is hiked above her hips, as bound 

as touch permits, saying don't forget me when I become the liquid 
out of which names are born, salt-milk, milk-sweet and animal-made. 

I want to be a human above the body, uprooted and right, a fold 
of pleas released, but I am a black wound, what's left of the deed.

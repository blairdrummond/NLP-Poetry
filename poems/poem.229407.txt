Dramatic Monologue, Persona

I would have been as great as George Eliot 
But for an untoward fate. 
For look at the photograph of me made by Peniwit, 
Chin resting on hand, and deep-set eyes i 
Gray, too, and far-searching. 
But there was the old, old problem: 
Should it be celibacy, matrimony or unchastity? 
Then John Slack, the rich druggist, wooed me, 
Luring me with the promise of leisure for my novel, 
And I married him, giving birth to eight children, 
And had no time to write. 
It was all over with me, anyway, 
When I ran the needle in my hand 
While washing the baby's things, 
And died from lock-jaw, an ironical death. 
Hear me, ambitious souls, 
Sex is the curse of life!

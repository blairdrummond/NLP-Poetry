title : The Road

text : 
I like the story of the circus waif 
bought by the man-of-weights to be his mistress,   
Profit the demon dragging her to market   
and Lust the soul who paid in lire for her. 

I like the peculiarities of her faith, 
the startling quality of that innocence,   
kissing the hand that dealt her cruelty   
believing, poor and dumb, that this was love. 

I relish a destitution stripped to sing 
pure in a voice all passion and denial: 
such are the driven burning by their breath   
more than mere air allows and cold permits. 

I savor my own involvement and concern   
lest all the transformations seem unreal,   
lest love be painted water-sweet and classic   
rather than salt and anguish to the end. 

I like her squatting in the village road 
combing the dust for something of her own,   
coming away belonging and committed, 
roots to be cherished, stones she could befriend. 

And what I like the subtlest and profoundest   
is that the circus traveled grief to grief   
educating the waif into a woman 
loving and beautiful and fiercely proud. 

I think of the sense of fury in that road,   
stooping to scratch the earth out for a life   
somewhere awaiting finding in one’s name.   
I like that, and I like the word Expense. 

I think of the years together which they had,   
the strong-man working her into the act,   
that hint, despite himself, of some devotion.   
I like that, and I like the ring of Cost. 

Not in a root, or stone, but in a man 
she found a thing to hold her tenderness.   
I like her dedication after that, 
her saying, if she spoke, I live by this. 

And what I like pervasive and forever 
is that my eyes have wept the tale before,   
wanting the telling not so much as story   
but for the way the waif befits my life.

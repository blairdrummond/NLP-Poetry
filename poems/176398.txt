title : Bees and Morning Glories

author : John Ciardi

text : 
Morning glories, pale as a mist drying,   
fade from the heat of the day, but already   
hunchback bees in pirate pants and with peg-leg   
hooks have found and are boarding them. 

This could do for the sack of the imaginary   
fleet. The raiders loot the galleons even as they   
one by one vanish and leave still real 
only what has been snatched out of the spell. 

I’ve never seen bees more purposeful except   
when the hive is threatened. They know   
the good of it must be grabbed and hauled   
before the whole feast wisps off. 

They swarm in light and, fast, dive in, 
then drone out, slow, their pantaloons heavy   
with gold and sunlight. The line of them,   
like thin smoke, wafts over the hedge. 

And back again to find the fleet gone.   
Well, they got this day’s good of it. Off   
they cruise to what stays open longer.   
Nothing green gives honey. And by now 

you’d have to look twice to see more than green   
where all those white sails trembled   
when the world was misty and open   
and the prize was there to be taken.

title : The Smell of Rat Rubs Off

Once again you’ve fallen for the lure 
of his deferral, his quick eyes’ brightness 
slinking from the pantry of the righteous. 
Nothing half so sleek as self-licked fur. 
Not that he forgot your boots, or left 
A single high-aimed compliment unturned. 
He’ll double back, affect to be concerned 
when he’s the secret reason you’re bereft, 
embracing you with his Houdini hold, 
repeating chewed-off bits of what you say 
so he seems loyal, you the turncoat jay. 
You’d think by now you’d learn to be consoled 
to know the soul he sold’s not yours but his, 
though where yours was a hollow feeling is.

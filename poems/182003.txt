Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love, 
after so many years of only that, 
after thinking that nothing else mattered. 

And what was I thinking of when I stopped 
thinking about Love? Death, of course—what else 
could take Love’s place? What else could hold such force? 

I thought about how far away Death once 
had seemed, how unexpected that it could 
happen to someone I knew quite well, 

how impossible that this should be the 
normal thing, as natural as frost and 
winter. I thought about the way we’d aged, 

how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew 
dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.

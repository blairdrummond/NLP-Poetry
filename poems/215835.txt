text : 
Back when the earth was new 
and heaven just a whisper, 
back when the names of things 
hadn't had time to stick; 

back when the smallest breezes 
melted summer into autumn, 
when all the poplars quivered 
sweetly in rank and file . . . 

the world called, and I answered. 
Each glance ignited to a gaze. 
I caught my breath and called that life, 
swooned between spoonfuls of lemon sorbet. 

I was pirouette and flourish, 
I was filigree and flame. 
How could I count my blessings 
when I didn't know their names? 

Back when everything was still to come, 
luck leaked out everywhere. 
I gave my promise to the world, 
and the world followed me here.

title : The Bunny Gives Us a Lesson in Eternity

author : Mary Ruefle

text : 
We are a sad people, without hats. 
The history of our nation is tragically benign. 
We like to watch the rabbits screwing in the graveyard. 
We are fond of the little bunny with the bent ear 
who stands alone in the moonlight 
reading what little text there is on the graves. 
He looks quite desirable like that. 
He looks like the center of the universe. 
Look how his mouth moves mouthing the words 
while the others are busy making more of him. 
Soon the more will ask of him to write their love 
letters and he will oblige, using the language 
of our ancestors, those poor clouds in the ground, 
beloved by us who have been standing here for hours, 
a proud people after all.

title : Why the Pretty One

This was a true happening but (as you 
will see shortly) not such as would ready me   
for future ones. What has brisk disaster   
to do with a leisurely ordeal? 
Neither event, as you will notice also,   
has made me an understanding man. 
It was my watch one night, away then on   
the sea, when leaning on a couple of crates   
of something I dreamed of nothing special   
into the dark, and whispered the smoke of a   
sugared native product into the dark. 
Then from behind a quick rush burst not six   
feet over me with a sawing and then 
a cracking sound, and the other watch   
pointed up where a black squall ran port-side   
into the distance and a six by six 
crate lid veered and disappeared like a gull.   
But the other time we were idle ashore 
for days somewhere there are sandy foothills 
and small plains with weeds that stand like birds,   
and there was a steady blow on land 
that left off out at sea, leaving us all 
peculiar if I remember. The wind 
rasped the dense whorls of sharp leaves low on the ground   
and shrilled through the heads on the tall seed-stalks,   
and all those days the sound rose until we,   
without hope, without breath bore the conviction   
that our sojourn had not begun and had   
no end, like a period of dissipation. 

In certain Spanish havens the beggars come 
to you saying “Give me an amount. God 
will make it good.” Had they been wise those ladies   
would have said something of that kind and proffered   
a gratifying smile to their junior 
treasurer the other Tuesday and maybe 
been spared a peculiar fall. For forgetting 
their cards or missing dues or due to rancor 
from a month of planning they were turned away 
from the luncheon which might have saved them through 
its regular plaudits and calls to order.   
Instead they turned immediately back 
after some while waiting with other members 
in vying groups where the sound rose and narrowed, 
and from the dim hushed hall those five ladies,   
my individual patrons, came across   
the park together, under a hefty sun,   
under slight muffling rain, to my teashop.   
I worked on a cruising vessel one season   
and saw a woman being led below   
about a minute after she had vaulted   
the rail, and now her face cluttered with casts   
of hair returned to me, and a suggestion   
of the odor of moist wool. Then, after   
ordering, over the tinkle of service,   
the ladies called me and began the question   
of a particular person none had touched,   
wondering by turns in words like these: 

“Maybe when he was a child he went alone 
one night along the lakeside or followed streams   
in the dark and mating mayflies swarmed him   
or he was caught by a swirl of slippery   
animals risen from rotted cresses.   
It could be too a bird’s egg fell on him,   
that red and yellow spattering his coat   
showed him the partial form of brain and bill   
and wings like candy arms.” A second lady   
established the problem but in studious   
and in idle terms: “He must have tried   
becoming a sphere once when something hurt   
and must have failed. He is a cylinder   
and lacking the perfected self-containment   
of the sphere he nonetheless has beauty   
and though incomplete is unassailable.”   
The third advanced the first with this addition:   
“Maybe when he was a child and a good half   
he planted a happy garden for himself   
and tried to bring a boyish girl inside   
to share his secrets he could not bestow.” 
The fourth supposed some more years and less hope   
and figured on effects of disaffection:   
“Perhaps it was a time sprouting potatoes   
came creeping like things of the undersea   
surrounding him that gave him the first fevered   
turn toward what we now call his fine beauty.”   
The last lady came near to reconciling   
them: “Some awareness certainly shook him   
unawares once and he flinched and flinching   
has made him beautiful to all of us 
who admire huge eyed skittishness, the fawn   
standing some steps off always awkward and   
desired.” 

             Odd gulls often join before   
a gale to bank and shrill in company,   
then at the heavy time of it they hush 
and float broadcast. Those ladies did the same   
the other Tuesday. Hopeless and breathless,   
both I and they rode like sitting birds into   
a last lull, and I was not (as you have seen)   
prepared by quick calamities of ocean   
labor for land bound suffering at ease.   
Understanding or unconcern could serve   
but pain and malice won, and who may be   
forgiven even his shapeless victories?   
“The boy is never by himself,” I said, 
“but by him stands an unseen friend whose face 
came in the petal fall under a secret 
tree, who meets his vague eyes with beaming gaps 
and his remote grin with a long lipless smile.”

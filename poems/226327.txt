"Yesterday the bird of night did sit, Even at noon-day, upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking."  —William Shakespeare 
1. 

Imagine waking 
to a scene of snow so new   
not even memories 
of other snow 
can mar its silken 
surface. What other innocence   
is quite like this, 
and who can blame me 
for refusing 
to violate such whiteness 
with the booted cruelty 
of tracks? 


2. 

Though I cannot leave this house,   
I have memorized the view 
from every window— 
23 framed landscapes, containing   
each nuance of weather and light.   
And I know the measure 
of every room, not as a prisoner   
pacing a cell 
but as the embryo knows 
the walls of the womb, free 
to swim as its body tells it, to nudge   
the softly fleshed walls, 
dreading only the moment 
of contraction when it will be forced   
into the gaudy world. 


3. 

Sometimes I travel as far 
as the last stone 
of the path, but 
every step, 
as in the children's story, 
pricks that tender place 
on the bottom of the foot, 
and like an ebbing tide with all 
the obsession of the moon behind it,   
I am dragged back. 


4. 

I have noticed in windy fall 
how leaves are torn from the trees,   
each leaf waving goodbye to the oak   
or the poplar that housed it; 
how the moon, pinned 
to the very center of the window, 
is like a moth wanting only to break in.   
What I mean is this house 
follows all the laws of lintel and ridgepole,   
obeys the commandments of broom   
and of needle, custom and grace. 
It is not fear that holds me here but passion   
and the uncrossable moat of moonlight   
outside the bolted doors.

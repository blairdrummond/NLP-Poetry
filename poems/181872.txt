1    I look at my hands 
      In a dark hour. 
      They are my wife, 
      Another life, 
      Fawnal, 
      Explicitly made. 
      I compare responsibility 
      To journey: 
      They are pitch-black 
      Whirling in the outside world 
      Left behind like a native— 
      Possessed. 

2    We are older: 
      Toil is our long way 
      Back home. 
      It works. 
      Causes the space to beat 
      Like a heart. 
      It is a part of the poem 
      That appears 
      And appears on its own. 
      It goes on 
      On its own, 
      Mystical as evil 
      But, it is called freedom. 

3    I’m sorry: 
      I was telling you about my hands. 
      How well we are married. 
      It follows, 
      I recognize all truth 
      As some part of ten. 
      Spirit is my thumb, 
      Passionately. 
      Without thumb 
      I would be nothing. 
      I have met some who believe in reason. 
      They have had too much wine, 
      Confess cause and effect— 
      It has been painful. 

4    I told you it is unreasonable: 
      I guess I should say here, 
      I am your carpenter. 
      Ethnically, dark wood 
      Is my life. 
      I could show you my story better, 
      Sanding, 
      Then where I speak 
      You would hear 
                     Africa 
                     Africa 
      One more thing, my love. 
      I have discovered in this dark wood 
      A skill you have called our loneliness. 
      I sand it down for you 
      Until our bodies fall off.

title : The Unnatural Apologie of Shadows

author : Nathalie Handal

text : 
We say lightning has no wings
 when it slides down our houses
  
 We say loss is just a condition
 we acquire to bury our pity further
  
 We say the bleeding hands
 on the table filled with red wine
 imported products and passports
 are just reminders of 
 who we have become
  
 We have no titles no birthright
 no groves or Shakespeare
 to return to
  
 We apologize for the fear
 growing out of our ribs
  
 Apologize for the numbers
 still etched on our tongues

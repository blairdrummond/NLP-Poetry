text : 
When my mother                     She who is not               All at once
Was a young girl                     Who she was                  I could see
Before the War                        Waits to be                     My mother
Reading sad books                  Yet she is                        In eternity
By the river                            Already                           I told her
Sometimes, she                      Mother                            She always
Looked up, wisely                   Whose child                      Would be
But did not dream                   Though not yet                The one
The day I would                      Could not be                   Whose son
Be born to her                        An other                         You see

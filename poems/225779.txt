A linear projection: a route. It crosses 
The ocean in many ships. Arriving in the new   
Land, it cuts through and down forests and it   
Keeps moving. Terrain: Rock, weaponry.   
Dark trees, mastery. Grass, to yield. Earth,   
Reproachful. Fox, bear, coon, wildcat   
Prowl gloomily, it kills them, it skins them,   
Its language alters, no account varmint, its 
Teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it becomes   
A snake in the reedy river. Spits and prays,   
Keeps moving. Behind it, a steel track. Cold,   
Permanent. Not permanent. It will decay. This   
Does not matter, it does not actually care, 
Murdering the buffalo, driving the laggard regiments,   
The caring was a necessary myth, an eagle like   
A speck in heaven dives. The line believes   
That the entire wrinkled mountain range is the   
Eagle’s nest, and everything tumbles in place.   
It buries its balls at Wounded Knee, it rushes   
Gold, it gambles. It buys plastics. Another   
Ocean stops it. Soon, soon, up by its roots,   
Severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not matter,   
It decides, perpendicular from here: escape. 

A prior circle: a mouth. It is nowhere, 
Everywhere, swollen, warm. Expanding and contracting   
It absorbs and projects children, jungles, 
Black shoes, pennies, blood. It speaks 
Too many dark, suffering languages. Reaching a hand   
Toward its throat, you disappear entirely. No 
Wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no wonder.

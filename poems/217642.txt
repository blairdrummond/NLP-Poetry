title : Why Are Your Poems So Dark?

author : Linda Pastan

text : 
Isn't the moon dark too,   
most of the time?   

And doesn't the white page   
seem unfinished   

without the dark stain   
of alphabets?   

When God demanded light,   
he didn't banish darkness.   

Instead he invented   
ebony and crows   

and that small mole   
on your left cheekbone.   

Or did you mean to ask   
"Why are you sad so often?"   

Ask the moon.   
Ask what it has witnessed.

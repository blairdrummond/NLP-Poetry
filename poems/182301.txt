title : [it’s rank it cranks you up]

text : 
it’s rank it cranks you up 
crash you’re fracked you suck 
shucks you’re wack you be 
all you cracked up to be 

dead on arrival   
overdosed on whatever 
excess of hate and love 
I sleep alone 

if you were there 
then please come in   
tell me what’s good 
think up something 

psychic sidekick 
gimme a pigfoot 
show me my lifeline 
read me my rights

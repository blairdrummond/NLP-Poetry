Poems for Weddings



Better trust all, and be deceived, 
   And weep that trust, and that deceiving; 
Than doubt one heart, that, if believed,
   Had blessed one's life with true believing. 

Oh, in this mocking world, too fast 
   The doubting fiend o'ertakes our youth! 
Better be cheated to the last,    
   Than lose the blessed hope of truth.

Sonnet  35: No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
William Shakespeare

No more be grieved at that which thou hast done: 
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, 
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, 
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. 
All men make faults, and even I in this, 
Authorizing thy trespass with compare, 
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss, 
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: 
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense-- 
Thy adverse party is thy advocate-- 
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence. 
Such civil war is in my love and hate, 
   That I an accessory needs must be 
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

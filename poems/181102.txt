text : 
Love, we were young once, and ran races 
over rough ground in our best shiny shoes, 
we kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces. 

Our knees were filthy with our secret places, 
with rituals and ranks, with strategy and ruse. 
Love, we were young once and ran races 

to determine the most rudimentary of  graces 
such as strength and speed and the ability to bruise. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces, 

and doing so left no permanent traces 
because we fought and fell only to confuse 
love. We were young. Once we ran races 

in ghettos, in camps, in the dismal spaces 
of  the imagination reserved for  Jews. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces 

at elastic braces, shoelaces, empty packing cases 
as if  they were the expressions we could choose. 
Love, we were young once, and ran races. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, we pulled faces.

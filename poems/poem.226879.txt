I saw a chapel all of gold 
That none did dare to enter in 
And many weeping stood without 
Weeping mourning worshipping

I saw a serpent rise between 
The white pillars of the door 
And he forcd & forcd & forcd 
Down the golden hinges tore 

And along the pavement sweet 
Set with pearls and rubies bright 
All his slimy length he drew 
Till upon the altar white 

Vomiting his poison out 
On the bread & on the wine
So I turnd into a sty 
And laid me down among the swine

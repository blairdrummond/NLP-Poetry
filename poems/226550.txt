title : “Teach Us to Number Our Days”

text : 
In the old neighborhood, each funeral parlor   
is more elaborate than the last. 
The alleys smell of cops, pistols bumping their thighs,   
each chamber steeled with a slim blue bullet. 

Low-rent balconies stacked to the sky.   
A boy plays tic-tac-toe on a moon   
crossed by TV antennae, dreams 

he has swallowed a blue bean. 
It takes root in his gut, sprouts 
and twines upward, the vines curling   
around the sockets and locking them shut. 

And this sky, knotting like a dark tie? 
The patroller, disinterested, holds all the beans. 

August. The mums nod past, each a prickly heart on a sleeve.

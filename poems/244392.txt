title : Mountain Building

author : Victor Hernández Cruz

The mountain have changed to buildings
 Is this hallway the inside of a stem
 That has a rattling flower for a head,
 Immense tree bark with roots made out of 
 Mailboxes?
 In the vertical village moons fly out of
 Apartment windows and though what you 
 See is a modern city
 The mountain’s guitars pluck inside
 It’s agriculture taking an elevator
 Through urban caves which lead to
 Paths underground They say Camuy
 To Hutuado
 Taino subground like the IRT in
 Constant motion
  
 The streets take walks in your dark eyes
 Seashell necklaces make music in the
 Origin of silence
 What are we stepping on? Pineapple
 Fields frozen with snow
 Concrete dirt later the rocks of the
 Atlantic
 The sculpture of the inner earth
 Down there where you thought only worms
 And unnamed crocodiles parade
 Lefty stands on a corner
 Analyzing every seed
 Squeezing the walls as he passes
 Through at the bottom of the basement
 Where the boiler makes heat
 The flesh arrives out of a hole
 In the mountain that goes up like a
 Green wall
 Bodies come in making maraca sounds
 An invisible map out of the flora
 Bees arrive in the vicinity and sing
 Chorus while woody woodpeckers make
 Women out of trees and place flowers
 On their heads
 Waterfalls like Hurakan’s faucets
 Caress the back of Yuquiyu
 God to all whose tongues have the
 Arawak’s echoes
  
 Hallway of graffiti like the master
 Cave drawings made by owls when they
 Had hands
 You see the fish with pyramids inside
 Their stomachs
 Hanging near the doorways where
 San Lazaro turns the keys
 Villa Manhattan
 Breeze of saint juice made from
 Coconuts
 Slide down the stairs to your
 Belly and like a hypnotized guanabana
 You float down the street
 And win all your hands at dominoes
  
 The Moros live on the top floor eating
 Roots and have a rooster on the roof
 Africans import okra from the bodega
 The Indians make a base of guava
 On the first floor
 The building is spinning itself into
 a spiral of salsa
 Heaven must be calling or the
 Residents know the direction
 Because there is an upward pull
 If you rise too quickly from your seat
 You might have to comb a spirit’s 
 Hair
 They float over the chimneys
 Arrive through the smog
 Appear through the plaster of Paris
 It is the same people in the windowed
 Mountains.

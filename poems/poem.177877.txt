Under the Poplars 
Cesar Vallejo 
1892-1938

Latin, America




for Jose Eulogio Garrido
Like priestly imprisoned poets,          
the poplars of blood have fallen asleep. 
On the hills, the flocks of Bethlehem                   
chew arias of grass at sunset.                   

      The ancient shepherd, who shivers          
at the last martyrdoms of light,                   
in his Easter eyes has caught                            
a purebred flock of stars.                            

      Formed in orphanhood, he goes down          
with rumors of burial to the praying field,          
and the sheep bells are seasoned with shadow. 

      It survives, the blue warped          
In iron, and on it, pupils shrouded,                   
A dog etches its pastoral howl.

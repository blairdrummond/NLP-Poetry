title : Difficulties of a Heavy Body

author : Rosmarie Waldrop

text : 
a sense of
 his thirty-third year
 takes
 his elbow
  
 *
  
 any kind of
 he says
 sniff
 must be allowed to mature
  
 *
  
 an accident leaves him
 and finally
 the swallows
  
 *
  
 by way of 
 curiosity he is no hand
 by no means
 to depict 
 a woman
  
 *
  
 often he knows
 a crowded room
  
 *
  
 just out of
 his mother
 he falls between the pursuit
 and a case he’d sooner forget
  
  
  
  
  
 *
  
 he has a 
 female muscle
 camouflaged
 for impact
  
 *
  
 streets enough
 to welcome snow
  
 *
  
 he knowingly succumbs to the
 brown sitzbaths
  
 *
  
 his wife touches
 a foretaste so vivid that
 the sheen of
 timber upsets
  
 *
  
 in going
 this sort of 
 persistence
  
 *
  
 difficulties of a
 heavy body
 placed in
 alternating gestures

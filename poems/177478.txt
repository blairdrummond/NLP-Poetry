title : The Man with Night Sweats

author : Thom Gunn

text : 
I wake up cold, I who 
Prospered through dreams of heat   
Wake to their residue,   
Sweat, and a clinging sheet.   

My flesh was its own shield:   
Where it was gashed, it healed. 

I grew as I explored   
The body I could trust   
Even while I adored 
The risk that made robust, 

A world of wonders in 
Each challenge to the skin. 

I cannot but be sorry 
The given shield was cracked, 
My mind reduced to hurry,   
My flesh reduced and wrecked. 

I have to change the bed,   
But catch myself instead 

Stopped upright where I am   
Hugging my body to me   
As if to shield it from   
The pains that will go through me, 
          
As if hands were enough   
To hold an avalanche off.

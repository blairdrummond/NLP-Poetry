title : The Safecracker

author : Linda Pastan

text : 
On nights when the moon seems impenetrable— 
a locked porthole to space; 
when the householder bars his windows   
and doors, and his dog lies until dawn, 
one jeweled eye open; when the maiden sleeps   
with her rosy knees sealed tightly together,   
on such nights the safecracker sets to work.   
Axe . . . Chisel . . . Nitroglycerin . . . 
Within the vault lie forty thousand   
tons of gold; the heaped up spoils   
of Ali Baba's cave; the secrets of the molecule.   
He sands his fingertips 
to feel the subtle vibrations 
of wheel lining up, just so, with wheel.   
His toolmarks are his fingerprints.   
And now a crack appears on the side   
of the egg, a single fault line, 
and within: the golden yolk just waiting. 
A kind of wind . . . a door flies open . . . a glitter   
of forsythia forced out of the branch.   
With smoothest fingertips you touch   
the locked cage of my ribs . . . just so.   
My knees fall open. And Cleopatra smiles,   
whose own Egyptians first invented the lock.

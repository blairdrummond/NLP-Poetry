					after this, the cold more intense, and the night comes rapidly up.angels in the fall.around a tongue of land, free from trees.awakened by feeling a heavy weight on your feet, something that seems inert and motionless.awestruck manner, as though you expected to find some strange presence behind you.coming through the diamond-paned bay window of your sanctum.a crimson-flowered silk dressing gown, the folds of which I could now describe.deathly pallor overspreading.describing the exact nature of your nightly troubles.discomfort at seeing a surface spoiled.echo and foretaste.the entrance blocked, not only by brambles and nettles, which have to be beaten aside, but by piles of faggots, old boxes, and even refuse.expecting every moment to see the door open and give admission to the original of my detested portrait.fantastic wigs, costumes, other disguises.filling up the width of the street.frequent tussles.the glitter of silver and glass and the subdued lights and cackle of conversation around the dinner table.high-backed carved oak chair.I have omitted in my narration . . ..in a great raftered hall.in a tableau vivant, as an angel, sewn up in tights, with wings on your back.light your candle andÂ  open the window.lines of your dress, with a hint of underthings.looking up, our problem still unsolved.luxurious with heavy silk and rich rococo furniture, all of it much soiled with age.many questions about the stars, of which you gave me my first intelligent idea.meanwhile, the snow, with ominous steadiness, and the wind falls.my weakness for the Ypsilanti Waltz, which I did regard as the most wonderful of compositions.neat strip of fine turf edging the road and running back until the poison of the dead beech leaves kills it under the trees.never venturing farther than a sandy beach, but losing everything at sea.not crawling or creeping, but spreading.not just out of repair, but in a condition of decay.only a foul trick after all.on the face of the judge in the picture, a malignant smile.profound impressions of unearthly horror.rambles and adventures among the rocky banks.the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof, which hangs down.rough horseplay and quarrels.sashes that splinter at a touch.the serpentlike form of the seraphim.something uncertain at work among the monuments.the thing on the bed, slowly shifting.till this particular day has passed through all the seasons of the year.the vicar, who used to tell us the story of Robinson Crusoe.waves and their whelps.while with a sickening revulsion after my terror, I drop half fainting across the end of the bed.with a pair of great greenish eyes shining dimly out within the lattice fronts.with painted carvings of saints and devils, a small galvanic battery, and a microscope

Down the path between the apples 
through the maple grove of suicides 
then left at the old wall 
along the wire fence to the brook- 
bank where narcissus noses 
into skunk cabbage and hepatica: 
Call me Apollo, crashing in the underbrush   
with my arrows, my bow saw and clippers   
out for your flash of white tail and alert 
to hack me a path to your lair, to your cult’s den,   
crisscrossing the water with Phoebe again and again   
as it elbows below us and runs 
for the creek racks 
strongest in springtime when everything’s liquid,   
tightroping over the rocks 
in the plashing braid, hot on your sharp 
scent and battling the mayflies 
the black flies horseflies mosquitoes   
there under the raspberry brambles and getting no nearer . . . 

Or am I fleeing your coiling uncoiling   
tentacular embrace 
battered and scarred, am I seeing   
your fabled face in the oily pools, 
are these fern hairs sprouting at your knuckles 
branchbones, little leaves halving 
our limbs with leaves—are they yours or mine?   
Your bloodhounds bay at the copper 
creek, your velvet cape’s aloft 
in the chiaroscuro breeze, you’re near, nearer,   
hieing, heying, I’m falling, failing, 
gashed, gutted, kneed-up, 
muddy and galled—call me 
Actaeon....

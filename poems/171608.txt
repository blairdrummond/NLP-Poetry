A professor invites me to his “Black Lit” class; they’re 
reading Larson’s Passing. One of the black 
students says, “Sometimes light-skinned blacks 
think they can fool other blacks, 
but I can always tell,” looking 
right through me. 
After I tell them I am black, 
I ask the class, “Was I passing 
when I was just sitting here, 
before I told you?” A white woman 
shakes her head desperately, as if 
I had deliberately deceived her. 
She keeps examining my face, 
then turning away 
as if she hopes I’ll disappear. Why presume 
“passing” is based on what I leave out 
and not what she fills in? 
In one scene in the book, in a restaurant, 
she’s “passing,” 
though no one checked her at the door— 
“Hey, you black?” 
My father, who looked white, 
told me this story: every year 
when he’d go to get his driver’s license, 
the man at the window filling 
out the form would ask, 
“White or black?” pencil poised, without looking up. 
My father wouldn’t pass, but he might 
use silence to trap a devil. 
When he didn’t speak, the man 
would look up at my father’s face. 
“What did he write?” 
my father quizzed me.

title : Cy Twombly, "Beyond (A System for Passing)"

author : H. L. Hix

text : 
To say how much I've missed you, I offer this,   
at most mist, at least assorted letters, lists, 
numbers I insist tell stories. I kissed you 
last, Dad, in the casket in which you passed on, 
to some next place, but last listened for your voice 
last night, these long years after, will listen next 
when next oppressed by blue-gray, as I am now, 
as I, thus lost, am always by your absence.

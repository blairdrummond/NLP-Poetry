Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

With the man I love who loves me not,
      I walked in the street-lamps' flare;
We watched the world go home that night
      In a flood through Union Square.

I leaned to catch the words he said
      That were light as a snowflake falling;
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
      The words my heart was calling.

And on we walked and on we walked
      Past the fiery lights of the picture shows ?
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
      On the errand each man knows.

And on we walked and on we walked,
      At the door at last we said good-bye;
I knew by his smile he had not heard
      My heart's unuttered cry.

With the man I love who loves me not
      I walked in the street-lamps' flare ?
But oh, the girls who ask for love
      In the lights of Union Square.

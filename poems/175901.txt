title : To the Desert

author : Benjamin Alire Sáenz

text : 
I came to you one rainless August night. 
You taught me how to live without the rain. 
You are thirst and thirst is all I know. 
You are sand, wind, sun, and burning sky, 
The hottest blue. You blow a breeze and brand 
Your breath into my mouth. You reach—then bend 
Your force, to break, blow, burn, and make me new. 
You wrap your name tight around my ribs 
And keep me warm. I was born for you. 
Above, below, by you, by you surrounded. 
I wake to you at dawn. Never break your 
Knot. Reach, rise, blow, Sálvame, mi dios, 
Trágame, mi tierra. Salva, traga, Break me, 
I am bread. I will be the water for your thirst.

title : On Distinction

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
We won’t pretend we’re not hungry for distinction 
but what can ever distinguish us enough? 
This country, this language won’t last long, the race 
will die, later the cockroach, earth itself, 

and last this beer bottle: silicon fused by man, 
almost indestructible, like a soul: 
it will go spinning ever farther from the nearest thing 
until space, continually deepening, drowns in itself. 

Yet we keep a hungry eye on old schoolmates 
and everyone born in the year of our own birth, 
and spend the nights in ranting over them, 
their money, fashionable companions, pliant critics. 

To live just a little longer than they do: 
that would be triumph. Hence exercise and diets, 
and the squabble over who will write the history 
of this paradise of demons casting each other out.

title : Becoming Anne Bradstreet

author : Eavan Boland

text : 
It happens again
 As soon as I take down her book and open it.
  
 I turn the page.
 My skies rise higher and hang younger stars.
  
 The ship's rail freezes.
 Mare Hibernicum leads to Anne Bradstreet's coast.
  
 A blackbird leaves her pine trees
 And lands in my spruce trees.
  
 I open my door on a Dublin street.
 Her child/her words are staring up at me:
  
 In better dress to trim thee was my mind,
 But nought save home-spun cloth, i' th' house I find.
  
 We say home truths
 Because her words can be at home anywhere—
  
 At the source, at the end and whenever
 The book lies open and I am again
  
 An Irish poet watching an English woman
 Become an American poet.

text : 
Trailing her father, bearing his hand axe,   
      the girl thought she had never 
   guessed what earthly majesty 
         was before 

then, as he strode unconcernedly 
      holding a vicious gander 
   by the horny mitts and let 
         the big wings 

batter his knees. She was also surprised   
      to feel a liberating 
   satisfaction in the coming 
         bloodshed, and 

that notwithstanding all the times she had   
      been beleaguered and 
   had fled, today she did not fear 
         the barnyard hubub. 

Yet, as her father’s clever stroke fell, as 
      the pronged head skipped sideways 
   and the neck plumes stiffened with blood 
         from the cleft, 

she was angry; and, when the headless goose   
      ran to the brook and was 
   carried off into the woods alive, 
         she rejoiced, 

and subsequently frequented those woods   
      and avoided her father. 
   When the goose began to mend she   
         brought him small 

hominy, which was welcome though she had   
      to press the kernels one 
   by one into the pink neck that 
         throbbed into 

her palm; when haemorrhage occurred she would   
      not spare handkerchiefs, 
   and stanching the spot she felt a thrill 
         of sympathy. 

But for the most part there was steady progress,   
      and growing vigor was 
   accompanied by restlessness, 
         and one cool day 

the blind thing was batted out of existence   
      by a motorcycle. 
   She had no time for tears. She ran   
         upstairs to miss 

her father’s barytone commiseration,   
      then out onto the fields, 
   and, holding an old red pinwheel,   
         ran ran ran ran.

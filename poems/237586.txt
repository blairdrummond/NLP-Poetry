title : Allow Me

If I must worry about how
 I will live in my old age
 without wealth
 I would be without health now
 and how can I live to be
 old?

 If I must worry about how
 I will live in my old age
 without love
 I would be without dreams now
 and how can I go on living
 another day?

 Allow me to sit in the sun
 and listen to the sky.
 I will love you gently.
Â  
 Allow me to stay in my room
 and weave my rainbows.
 I will love you truly.

 Like a colt in the meadow
 with no boundary
 allow me

 to wander around 

 till I hear the autumn
 stealthily
 strolling by my door.

 I will be waiting
 to be with you
 then.

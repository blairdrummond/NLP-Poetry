Poems for Weddings



I 

Leaguered in fire 
The wild black promontories of the coast extend 
Their savage silhouettes; 
The sun in universal carnage sets, 
And, halting higher, 
The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats, 
Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned, 
That, balked, yet stands at bay. 
Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day 
In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline, 
A wan Valkyrie whose wide pinions shine 
Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray, 
And in her hand swings high o'erhead, 
Above the waster of war, 
The silver torch-light of the evening star 
Wherewith to search the faces of the dead. 


                                    II 

Lagooned in gold, 
Seem not those jetty promontories rather 
The outposts of some ancient land forlorn, 
Uncomforted of morn, 
Where old oblivions gather, 
The melancholy unconsoling fold 
Of all things that go utterly to death 
And mix no more, no more 
With life's perpetually awakening breath? 
Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore, 
Over such sailless seas, 
To walk with hope's slain importunities 
In miserable marriage? Nay, shall not 
All things be there forgot, 
Save the sea's golden barrier and the black 
Close-crouching promontories? 
Dead to all shames, forgotten of all glories, 
Shall I not wander there, a shadow's shade, 
A spectre self-destroyed, 
So purged of all remembrance and sucked back 
Into the primal void, 
That should we on the shore phantasmal meet 
I should not know the coming of your feet?

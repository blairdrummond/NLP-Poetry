text : 
When we are out of gas, 
a headache haloes the roof, 
darkening the skin of everyone who has a full tank. 

I was told that the nectar of shoelaces, 
if squeezed hard enough, 
turns to water and trickles from the caribou’s snout. 

A glacier nibbled from its center 
spiders a story of the Southern Cross, 
twin brothers 
dancing in the back room lit with cigarettes 
break through the drum’s soft skin— 
      There bone faces atlas 
            a grieving century.

title : An Altogether Different Language

author : Anne Porter

text : 
There was a church in Umbria, Little Portion, 
Already old eight hundred years ago. 
It was abandoned and in disrepair 
But it was called St. Mary of the Angels 
For it was known to be the haunt of angels, 
Often at night the country people 
Could hear them singing there. 

What was it like, to listen to the angels, 
To hear those mountain-fresh, those simple voices 
Poured out on the bare stones of Little Portion 
In hymns of joy? 
No one has told us. 
Perhaps it needs another language 
That we have still to learn, 
An altogether different language.

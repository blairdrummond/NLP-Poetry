title : Misery and Splendor

Summoned by conscious recollection, she 
would be smiling, they might be in a kitchen talking, 
before or after dinner. But they are in this other room, 
the window has many small panes, and they are on a couch 
embracing. He holds her as tightly   
as he can, she buries herself in his body. 
Morning, maybe it is evening, light 
is flowing through the room. Outside, 
the day is slowly succeeded by night, 
succeeded by day. The process wobbles wildly 
and accelerates: weeks, months, years. The light in the room 
does not change, so it is plain what is happening. 
They are trying to become one creature, 
and something will not have it. They are tender 
with each other, afraid 
their brief, sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment 
when they fall away again. So they rub against each other, 
their mouths dry, then wet, then dry. 
They feel themselves at the center of a powerful 
and baffled will. They feel 
they are an almost animal, 
washed up on the shore of a world— 
or huddled against the gate of a garden— 
to which they can’t admit they can never be admitted.

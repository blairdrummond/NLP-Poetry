title : A Blasphemy

author : Maurice Manning

text : 
You wouldn't have believed it, how 
the man, a little touched perhaps,   

set his hands together and prayed 
for happiness, yet not his own; 

he meant his people, by which he meant 
not people really, but trees and cows, 

the dirty horses, dogs, the fox 
who lived at the back of his place with her kits, 

and the very night who settled down 
to rock his place to sleep, the place 

he tried so hard to tend he found 
he mended fences in his sleep. 

He said to the you above, who, let's 
be honest, doesn't say too much, 

I need you now up there to give 
my people happiness, you let 

them smile and know the reason; hear 
my prayer, Old Yam. The you who's you 

might laugh at that, and I agree, 
it's funny to make a prayer like that, 

the down-home words and yonder reach 
of what he said; and calling God 

the Elder Sweet Potato, shucks, 
that's pretty funny, and kind of sad.

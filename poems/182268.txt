title : Small Moth

author : Sarah Lindsay

text : 
She's slicing ripe white peaches 
into the Tony the Tiger bowl 
and dropping slivers for the dog 
poised vibrating by her foot to stop their fall 
when she spots it, camouflaged, 
a glimmer and then full onâ€” 
happiness, plashing blunt soft wings 
inside her as if it wants 
to escape again.

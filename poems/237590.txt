title : Visiting My Gravesite: Talbott Churchyard, West Virginia

author : Irene McKinney

text : 
Maybe because I was married and felt secure and dead
 at once, I listened to my father’s urgings about “the future”

 and bought this double plot on the hillside with a view
 of the bare white church, the old elms, and the creek below. 

 I plan now to use both plots, luxuriantly spreading out
 in the middle of a big double bed. —But no,

 finally, my burial has nothing to do with marriage, this lying here
 in these same bones will be as real as anything I can imagine

 for who I’ll be then, as real as anything undergone, going back
and forth to “the world” out there, and here to this one spot

 on earth I really know. Once I came in fast and low
in a little plane and when I looked down at the church, 

the trees I’ve felt with my hands, the neighbors’ houses
 and the family farm, and I saw how tiny what I loved or knew was, 

 it was like my children going on with their plans and griefs
 at a distance and nothing I could do about it. But I wanted

 to reach down and pat it, while letting it know
 I wouldn’t interfere for the world, the world being 

 everything this isn’t, this unknown buried in the known.

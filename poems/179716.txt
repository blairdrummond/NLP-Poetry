title : [Yesterday, the sunshine made the air glow]

Yesterday, the sunshine made the air glow 
pushing me like a sixteen-year-old 
to toss my shirt off, and run along the river shore, 
splashing in the water, wading out to the reeds, 
my heart an ancient Yaki drum 
and I believed, 
          more than believed, 
          the air beneath trees was female blue dancers 
          I approached, and there in the dry leaves, in the crisp twigs, 
          I turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air, 
                                                                                           sunlight, 
                   in shrub-weed skirts. 
                   I knew the dance that would please the Gods, 
                   I knew the dance that would make the river water 
                   smile glistening ever silvering, 
                   I knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors. 

Yeah, I wanted to write you a poem woman 
for two days, 
and today it was gray and snowy and overcast, 
         about how I startled the mallards from their shallow 
refuge beneath the Russian olive trees 
and how the male purposely 
                   came close to me 
                   diverting my attention to it 
         its female love went the other way 
         risking its life, 
         that's what I saw, 
the male fly before the hunter's rifles, circle in sights of hunters 
and take the shots, the roaring rifle blast 
                                              after blast 
and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion. 

That's how I miss you, that's how I wanted to write you a poem 
since we left 
         you one way 
         me another way. I was the male 
         taking with me the hunters that would harm you 
         risking my heart so yours wouldn't be hurt, 
         fronting myself as possible prey 
         so you could escape, 
         that kind of poem 
                   I am writing you now. 

Circling as hunters aim down on me 
while you rise, rise, rise into the blue sky 
         and meet me over in the next fields. 

         I wanted to write you a poem for two days now 
                  to tell you how happy I was, 
                  seeing a white crane arc 
                           between banks in the irrigation ditch 
                           with furious efforts, its big wings flapping 
                                       like an awkward nine-year-old kid 
                                       much taller than the others his age 
                                       with size twelve sneakers 
                                       flapping down the basketball court. 

But once the white crane 
found its balance, its wings their grace, it glided more perfectly 
than a ballet dancer's leap across air, 
                  all of its feathers ballet dancer's toes, 
                  all of its feathers delicate dancers 
                  all of its feathers, in motion 
                           made me believe in myself, 
but more, 
                  when it rose, swooped up, 
                  the line of ascent up 
                  made me think of the curve of your spine, 
                  how I traced my finger down your spine 
                  when you slept, 
your spine 
                  is the ascent of the crane 
                  toward the sunshine, 
and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips 
became air, a blue cold artic air 
you glided up in your song of winter love.

title : Song for Pythagoras

author : Dannie Abse

text : 
White coat and purple coat 
   a sleeve from both he sews. 
That white is always stained with blood,   
   that purple by the rose. 

And phantom rose and blood most real   
   compose a hybrid style; 
white coat and purple coat 
   few men can reconcile. 

White coat and purple coat 
   can each be worn in turn 
but in the white a man will freeze 
   and in the purple burn.

title : The New Experience

author : Suzanne Buffam

text : 
I was ready for a new experience.
 All the old ones had burned out.
  
 They lay in little ashy heaps along the roadside
 And blew in drifts across the fairgrounds and fields.
  
 From a distance some appeared to be smoldering 
 But when I approached with my hat in my hands
  
 They let out small puffs of smoke and expired.
 Through the windows of houses I saw lives lit up
  
 With the otherworldly glow of TV
 And these were smoking a little bit too.
  
 I flew to Rome. I flew to Greece.
 I sat on a rock in the shade of the Acropolis
  
 And conjured dusky columns in the clouds.
 I watched waves lap the crumbling coast.
  
 I heard wind strip the woods.
 I saw the last living snow leopard
  
 Pacing in the dirt. Experience taught me
 That nothing worth doing is worth doing
  
 For the sake of experience alone.
 I bit into an apple that tasted sweetly of time.
  
 The sun came out. It was the old sun
 With only a few billion years left to shine.

Trying to see the proportional relation
 Of one memory to another
 One is so strange, and then
 To try and see what looms
 And doesn’t for the other person
 Who was there, it gets stranger,
 Especially when you’ve read
 His email.
 I don’t know how people
 Understand their lives, measure
 Their sensations against “objective”
 Or so-to-speak democratic estimations,
 Whether people accept the externality
 Of events, “events,” as things
 That happen to them. I refuse
 To accept some coagulate
 Of other people’s
 Impressions in exchange for this
 Privacy, no matter how flawed it is.
 This is lyric poetry. It has to be. It has
 No other hope. What was it
 About you and me that made whatever 
 Happen to us. In New York
 Everything fell apart. What I dreaded
 And expected.
 But still. Tonight
 It is dark and the weather is cooler
 Than it’s been. It has taken
 A while for Fall to break; the global
 Warming kept me in summer
 Love with you like I was under a
 Fermata. Now that the times
 Are changing, I feel
 Even more for you; or I feel nothing.
 I can’t tell; it’s kind
 Of scary. I was sick of thinking
 About you this morning but
 I was listening to Bob Dylan and Leonard
 Cohen in order to think about
 You for literary purposes.
 When I feel nothing for a person
 I get scared I’m losing my humanity
 And that turning cold means 
 My heart’s been botoxed: we’re
 All fucked.
 I watched a movie on YouTube
 Called Ladies and Gentlemen, Mister
 Leonard Cohen that was made when
 He was still just a poet and only 
 Famous in Canada.
 He’s a pretentious little nerd
 In it, self-important, teacher’s pet wit.
 I think that, making music, he became
 So much nakeder, much more desperate.
 The talent, real, even pure, even
 Natural, had to ripen in
 The artificial man.
 Alain Badiou, on the day
 Of his class, said, “Because an event
 Is pure rapture, an event disappears
 Immediately: it does not exist
 Objectively, but only by appearing
 And disappearing.” This is both
 Precise and vague; it is attractive
 I guess. I guess since you and me did not
 Disappear immediately, it was
 Not pure rapture, not in these
 Terms, but my smile
 Was real each time I swallowed
 Your cum. Getting
 Fucked by you was great; I could
 Feel it in my organs, but
 You didn’t make me go insane
 Except for maybe once 
 Or twice. Actually maybe I am
 Being unfair. Maybe the fucking really
 Was that great. In this moment I
 Can’t remember.
 I just read a poetry
 Review in which the reviewer
 States that a certain book
 Made his cock feel as though
 It were tall as a tree. That’s
 Nice. I have no idea
 What it feels like to have
 A cock. Sometimes I feel
 As though I’m getting close
 To understanding and then
 Something happens to make
 Me have no clue again. When Sinan
 Fucks me, we lose our individuality
 So severely it’s like we’re both
 Gasping after an animal that’s his
 Cock that is beyond us and I lose
 All sense of the world. His cock’s
 Not even him, and he’s not him either
 And we aren’t anything.
 It’s strange, the possessive. Didn’t Thomas
 Mann write a book called Herr
 Und Hund or something like that?
 Man’s best friend. What belongs
 To him. Me and Sunder 
 Talked about how scary and arousing
 It is to watch men masturbate, cos
 Everyone relates differently to his.
 Like dicks are always almost but never
 Quite another. Je est un autre,
 Said that brat Arthur Rimbaud.
 I am definitely in love with you
 As I write this. You are so petty
 And superfluous I cannot stand
 You. Sinan is definitely
 In love with me. I know, because
 I saw him tonight. I love
 Him too. You are gracious
 To accord me the space and time
 In which to develop, or to elaborate 
 Upon, as the French say, these
 Extreme emotions I am, despite
 The odds and certain lapses,
 So capable of feeling.
 It was good to slap
 Your face and to admit
 That your asshole 
 Made me nervous.
 Your eyes had a way 
 Of going soft and shiny
 When you said the really
 Tender things. We admitted
 It was intimidating
 For us both to hear each other describe
 People we’ve fucked and been
 In love with. I’m proud of what
 We accomplished together. Alain Badiou
 Ended his class with a reading
 Of “Ariane et Barbe-Bleue” which
 Is an opera by Paul Dukas. You
 And me had gone pretty far
 By the time this day came, and
 Something very fragile in me breaks
 When somebody says my name, or
 Even a variant of it. I was tired.
 I think Badiou discusses “Ariane”
 In Being and Event which
 I have not read. In class he said
 That the story of the opera is 
 About the relationship between law
 And freedom, and that it shows
 That the desire for freedom is not
 So simple. Ariane experiences an Event
 That causes her to demand freedom, Badiou
 Said, but she is unable to convince anybody
 Else, any other women to want freedom; she ends up alone.
 She genuinely falls in love with the wicked 
 Bluebeard at the beginning. Bluebeard
 Who previously got women by having a castle
 To lock them in. This woman Ariane
 Does not have to be taken
 By force. When she enters
 His castle he hands
 Her seven keys, six
 Of which he gives her permission
 To use, and leaves. She hears the cries
 Of his other, imprisoned wives,
 Coming from behind a door. So she uses
 The forbidden key, releasing them.
 Meanwhile Bluebeard is assaulted
 By the local peasants, who want
 To free Ariane, fearing her fate will turn out like
 That of the women who came before her.
 But Ariane is already free
 In herself, and proves this freedom
 By bringing the wounded Bluebeard
 Home, caring tenderly for him, and then
 Declaring that she’s leaving him for good.
 By the end Bluebeard’s shattered, sobbing, 
 Bleeding. Ariane
 Invites the other wives to leave with her
 In a wrenching aria, pleading
 With them one by one to taste
 With her the freedom awaiting 
 Them, The World. But they all prefer confinement
 Even though they had longed
 For freedom before Ariane opened
 Their door. Once liberty arrived they were no
 Longer capable of it, preferring to serve; even a gutted,
 Hollowed-out power. Ariane exits
 Alone. The end. Badiou narrated
 This with emotion and 
 I cried. Maybe cos I was tired and
 That thing about my name or because
 I am not heroic or free.
 I had missed half of Alain Badiou’s
 Lectures messing around with you
 On the couch by the fire; in the women’s
 Toilets; up on the hill. If this were a suitable parable,
 And it isn’t, I would try to tell myself
 That those very early mornings in Brooklyn when I sat
 Up in your bed feeling wrong and
 Got dressed and walked away, I should
 Have stayed away cos I don’t need you.
 Maybe I don’t need you. But I want
 You. Maybe I don’t love you. But
 I am getting to know you. Maybe
 What made me cry in class was how tired
 I was and how sad and hard
 It is, and how rare, to undertake an act
 That’s truly free, and not just a response
 To a confused surge of drives and  fears.

title : The Piper

author : Joseph Campbell

text : 
George Borrow in his Lavengro 
Tells us of a Welshman, who
By some excess of mother-wit
Framed a harp and played on it,
Built a ship and sailed to sea,
And steered it home to melody
Of his own making. I, indeed,
Might write for Everyman to read
A thaumalogue of wonderment
More wonderful, but rest content
With celebrating one I knew
Who built his pipes, and played them, too:
No more.
                         Ah, played! Therein is all:
The hounded thing, the hunter's call;
The shudder, when the quarry's breath
Is drowned in blood and stilled in death;
The marriage dance, the pulsing vein,

The kiss that must be given again; 
The hope that Ireland, like a rose, 
Sees shining thro' her tale of woes; 
The battle lost, the long lament 
For blood and spirit vainly spent; 
And so on, thro' the varying scale 
Of passion that the western Gael 
Knows, and by miracle of art 
Draws to the chanter from the heart 
Like water from a hidden spring, 
To leap or murmur, weep or sing.

I see him now, a little man 
In proper black, whey-bearded, wan, 
With eyes that scan the eastern hills 
Thro' thick, gold-rimmèd spectacles. 
His hand is on the chanter. Lo, 
The hidden spring begins to flow 
In waves of magic. (He is dead 
These seven years, but bend your head
And listen.) Rising from the clay 
The Master plays The Ring of Day. 
It mounts and falls and floats away 
Over the sky-line . . . then is gone 
Into the silence of the dawn!

title : December Substitute

Our substitute is strange because 
he looks a lot like Santa Claus. 
In fact, the moment he walked in 
we thought that he was Santa’s twin. 

We wouldn’t think it quite so weird, 
if it were just his snowy beard. 
But also he has big black boots 
and wears these fuzzy bright red suits. 

He’s got a rather rounded gut 
that’s like a bowl of you-know-what. 
And when he laughs, it’s deep and low 
and sounds a lot like “Ho! Ho! Ho!” 

He asks us all if we’ve been good 
and sleeping when we know we should. 
He talks of reindeers, sleighs, and elves 
and tells us to behave ourselves. 

And when it’s time for us to go 
he dashes out into the snow. 
But yesterday we figured out 
just what our sub is all about. 

We know just why he leaves so quick, 
and why he’s dressed like Old Saint Nick 
in hat and coat and boots and all: 
He’s working evenings at the mall.

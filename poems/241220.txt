Country people rise early 
as their distant lights testify. 
They don’t hold water in common. Each house 
has a personal source, like a bank account, 
a stone vault. Some share eggs, 
some share expertise, 
and some won’t even wave. 
A walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. 
Last November I saw a woman down the road 
walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange 
cap to boot, a cautious soul. 
Bullets can’t read her No Trespassing sign. 
Strange to think they’re in the air 
like lead bees with a fatal sting. 
Our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen 
with his rifle handy and the window open. 
You never know when. Once 
he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. 
He’s in his seventies, born here, joined the Navy, 
came back. Hard work never hurt a man 
until suddenly he was another broken tool. 
His silhouette against the dawn 
droops as though drought-stricken, each step 
deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox, 
prying it open. Checking a trap.

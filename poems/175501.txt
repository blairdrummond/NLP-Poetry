title : An Offering

author : John Reibetanz

text : 
When a creature dies ... the flesh 
and soft parts of the body rot quickly. 
All that is left are the bones and teeth. 
       (textbook entry on ‘fossils’) 

Sometimes. You, mother, 
dying, left what was hard first: 
bones weeping into 

your veins like flutes, teeth 
vanished on some hospital 
lunch tray. In your last 

mute days you parted 
with one more hard thing: the gold 
ring I was to save 

for my child. As your 
hand offered that bright circle 
(only seen as a 

whole now, when empty) 
did your thoughts reach, like mine, for 
your first wedding ring? 

You took that one off 
when I was seven or eight 
and sent it spinning 

from a car window. 
I can still feel the wet blades 
of grass slipping through 

my fingers, night dew 
coming on, you and father 
loud in the parked car. 

I searched there as if 
life spilled from a ring that lay 
somewhere out of sight 

but within reach, hid 
where only the crickets knew. 
I took the scraping 

of their mating calls 
for crying, as if they shared 
loss—my childish heart 

consoled by a soft 
‘as if.’ The consolation 
carries on: their song 

(light as air, softer 
than voices) plays through my thoughts 
about that evening 

and fills the lost ring’s 
hollow with life’s most lasting 
part, cries for new love.

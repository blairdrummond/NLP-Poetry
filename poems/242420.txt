title : Christmas Prelude

author : Lisa Jarnot

text : 
O little fleas
 of speckled light
 all dancing
 like a satellite
  
 O belly green trees
 shaded vale
 O shiny bobcat
 winter trail
  
 Amoebic rampage
 squamous cock
 a Chinese hairpiece
 burly sock
  
 A grilled banana
 smashes gates
 and mingeless badgers
 venerate
  
 The asses of the 
 winter trees
 rock on fat asses
 as you please
  
 Be jumpy
 or unhinged
 with joy
 enlightened
 fry cakes
 Staten hoy.

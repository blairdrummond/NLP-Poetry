title : An Afternoon at the Beach

author : Edgar Bowers

text : 
I’ll go among the dead to see my friend. 
The place I leave is beautiful: the sea 
Repeats the winds’ far swell in its long sound, 
And, there beside it, houses solemnly 
Shine with the modest courage of the land, 
While swimmers try the verge of what they see. 

I cannot go, although I should pretend 
Some final self whose phantom eye could see 
Him who because he is not cannot change. 
And yet the thought of going makes the sea, 
The land, the swimmers, and myself seem strange, 
Almost as strange as they will someday be.

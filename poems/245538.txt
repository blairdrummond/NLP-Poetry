title : The Appeal of Antiques

author : Allan Peterson

text : 
The intriguing comfort of an imagined past
 is entered through objects
 the same way we continue the present
 but without nostalgia
 Parents so long for happiness they say
 one life is not enough
 and live through their children
 But children also live backwards through past candles
 crank telephones   carriages
 the ascendant animals that lived not in imagination
 but in Kansas and before
 there was an Oklahoma with its spotted sun
  
 In those days a metaphor for Hell was the corn sheller
 field corn shriven  shooting out cobs
 the grindstone   razor strop   even the ladder of progress
 from which Les Westfield slipped
 on a mossy rung though his son held the ladder
 and fell two stories:
 one the feudal structure of the family   two the harmonic
 of almost fatal necessity
 as the maple stump entered his hip along with the difficult
 remission of breath itself
 an antique whose furious elaborations mimicked the rose

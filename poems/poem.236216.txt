I dwell in Possibility - 
A fairer House than Prose - 
More numerous of Windows - 
Superior - for Doors - 

Of Chambers as the Cedars - 
Impregnable of eye - 
And for an everlasting Roof 
The Gambrels of the Sky - 

Of Visitors - the fairest - 
For Occupation - This - 
The spreading wide my narrow Hands 
To gather Paradise -

Epigram, Rhymed Stanza

As a friend to the children commend me the Yak.   
   You will find it exactly the thing: 
It will carry and fetch, you can ride on its back,   
   Or lead it about with a string. 

The Tartar who dwells on the plains of Thibet   
   (A desolate region of snow) 
Has for centuries made it a nursery pet,   
   And surely the Tartar should know! 

Then tell your papa where the Yak can be got,   
   And if he is awfully rich 
He will buy you the creature--or else he will not. 
   (I cannot be positive which.)

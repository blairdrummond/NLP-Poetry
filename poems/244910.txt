You can get there from here, though
 there’s no going home.
  
 Everywhere you go will be somewhere
 you’ve never been. Try this:
  
 head south on Mississippi 49, one-
 by-one mile markers ticking off
  
 another minute of your life. Follow this
 to its natural conclusion—dead end
  
 at the coast, the pier at Gulfport where
 riggings of shrimp boats are loose stitches
  
 in a sky threatening rain. Cross over
 the man-made beach, 26 miles of sand
  
 dumped on the mangrove swamp—buried
 terrain of the past. Bring only
  
 what you must carry—tome of memory,
 its random blank pages. On the dock
  
 where you board the boat for Ship Island,
 someone will take your picture:
  
 the photograph—who you were—
 will be waiting when you return.

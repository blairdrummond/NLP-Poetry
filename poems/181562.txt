title : Prelude

author : Michael Palmer

text : 
The limit of the song is this 
prelude to a journey to 
the outer islands, the generative 
sentence, waltz project, forms, 
qualities, suns, moons, rings, 
an inside-outside then 
an outside-inside shaped 
with her colored clays. The days 
yet propse themselves 
as self-evident, everything there 
everything here 
and you are reading 
in a way natural to theatre 
a set of instructions 
that alters itself automatically 
as you proceed west 
from death to friendliness, the two 
topics upon which you are allowed 
to meditate 
under the first broad drops 
of rain. The planes 
will be piloted by ancestors 
who have come back to life. 
Why the delay.

“Mister Johnson
I see you look to buyin'
Mister Johnson
That all you want is Fame?
Mister Johnson
Now what you got to offer?
Mister Johnson
Salvation is my name
With a rhythm on a riff
That's practically God
Oh Lord, I'm a pure
Undivining rod
I'm a flickerin' candle
With the blackest light
I'm the darkest angel
And I own the night
Mister Johnson
That instrument you got there
Mister Johnson
It's Lucifer's guitar
Mister Johnson
I'll tune it for you, baby
Mister Johnson
They won't know who you are
I'm a cutthroat seller,
The Magician of Deal
Who can stoke sweet fire
That'll make you feel
Like a hothouse flower
On double defrost
Who won't give a nickel
For the petals it lost
Mister Johnson
You slink on back to livin'
Mister Johnson
In devil-may-care control
Mister Johnson
Don't thank me for the favor
Mister Johnson
I thank you for your soul”

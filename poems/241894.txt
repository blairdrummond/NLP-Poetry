title : The Season's Campaign

author : Joyce Sidman

text : 
I.  Spring
  
 We burst forth,
 crisp green squads
 bristling with spears.
 We encircle the pond. 
  
 II.  Summer
  

Brown velvet plumes
bob jauntily. On command,
our slim, waving arrows
rush toward the sun.
 
III.  Fall
 
All red-winged generals
desert us.  Courage
clumps and fluffs
like bursting pillows.
 
IV. Winter
 
Our feet are full of ice.
Brown bones rattle in the wind.
Sleeping, we dream of
seed-scouts, sent on ahead.

title : The Length of the Hour

New houses relax on the fields.
 Garage doors open soundlessly
 to admit the monster. Tires stretched
 over forty pounds of air
 pressure float across gravel.
  
 The boy closes the last storm
 door on the last evening
 paper and runs to the car
 where his mother waits. She does not
 answer him; the door slam freezes
 her dreams. It is January.
  
 A dog chained to a barn door
 keeps barking. Somebody’s angry,
 scared to let him go.
 On the other side
 of a forest past these fields,
 wolves sniff the hard snow
 of the tundra. I lay beside the only
 tree for warmth, there
 where the pack might find me.
  
 The house takes care of us now.
 Look at the meat
 browning under the light.
 The refrigerator switches on;
 ice crashes into the tray.
  
 Here are locks in case someone
 wants to do us harm. Remember
 how the police had to pound and pound
 to wake us that night a white Cadillac
 leapt from the icy road
  
 into the arms of our maple! It hung there,
 empty, doors flung wide—
 it was a great white petal of a car,
 breathing under the gas-lights, opening
 and opening.

Rhymed Stanza

Shy one, shy one, 
Shy one of my heart, 
She moves in the firelight 
Pensively apart. 

She carries in the dishes, 
And lays them in a row. 
To an isle in the water 
With her would I go. 

She carries in the candles, 
And lights the curtained room, 
Shy in the doorway 
And shy in the gloom; 

And shy as a rabbit, 
Helpful and shy. 
To an isle in the water 
With her would I fly.

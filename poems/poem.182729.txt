Give me something to eat, 
   Good people, I pray; 
I have really not had 
   One mouthful today! 

I am hungry and cold, 
   And last night I dreamed 
A scarecrow had caught me--    
   Good land, how I screamed! 

Of one little children 
   And six ailing wives 
(No, one wife and six children), 
   Not one of them thrives. 

So pity my case, 
   Dear people, I pray; 
I'm honest, and really 
   I've come a long way.

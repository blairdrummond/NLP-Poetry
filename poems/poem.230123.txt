Sonnet

I think I should have loved you presently, 
And given in earnest words I flung in jest; 
And lifted honest eyes for you to see, 
And caught your hand against my cheek and breast; 
And all my pretty follies flung aside 
That won you to me, and beneath your gaze, 
Naked of reticence and shorn of pride, 
Spread like a chart my little wicked ways. 
I, that had been to you, had you remained, 
But one more waking from a recurrent dream, 
Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained, 
And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme, 
A ghost in marble of a girl you knew 
Who would have loved you in a day or two.

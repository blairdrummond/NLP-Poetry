It could be a clip, it could be a comb; 
it could be your mother, coming home.   
It could be a rooster; perhaps it’s a comb;   
it could be your father, coming home.   
It could be a paper; it could be a pin.   
It could be your childhood, sinking in. 

The toys give off the nervousness of age.   
It’s useless pretending they aren’t finished:   
faces faded, unable to stand, 
buttons lost down the drain during baths.   
Those were the days we loved down there,   
the soap disappearing as the water spoke, 

saying, it could be a wheel, maybe a pipe;   
it could be your father, taking his nap. 
Legs propped straight, the head tilted back;   
the end was near when he could keep track. 
It could be the first one; it could be the second;   
the father of a friend just sickened and sickened.

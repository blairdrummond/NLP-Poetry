title : Chaucer

author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

text : 
An old man in a lodge within a park; 
      The chamber walls depicted all around 
      With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and hound, 
      And the hurt deer. He listeneth to the lark, 
Whose song comes with the sunshine through the dark 
      Of painted glass in leaden lattice bound; 
      He listeneth and he laugheth at the sound, 
      Then writeth in a book like any clerk. 
He is the poet of the dawn, who wrote 
      The Canterbury Tales, and his old age 
      Made beautiful with song; and as I read 
I hear the crowing cock, I hear the note 
      Of lark and linnet, and from every page 
      Rise odors of ploughed field or flowery mead.

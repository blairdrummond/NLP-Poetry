    not to be in love with you I can’t remember what it was like                      it must’ve been lousy                                                       James Schuyler
You take off your black
 motorcycle jacket, hang it
 on the back of a chair. It’s cold
 from our walk along the sea wall.
 Your pockets jingle with shells.
 While we were gone, you left
 the stove on low—some things
 you do make me so nervous.
 You graze the surface of sauce
 simmering in a pan, shiny fingertip
 held out for me to lick, you say
 “What does it need?” Maybe nothing,
 maybe honey to unbitter the lime.
 Later that night you’ll bury your face
 in my belly and sob. “I’m sorry,”
 though I don’t think you are
 always talking to me, my love.
 But now lobster steam billows
 up the window, you gulp
 purple wine, your pinky sticking out,
 and the round olives are the green
 all green things aspire to be.

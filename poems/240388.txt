Anatomie des parties de la génération, Paris, 1773
What have they done to deserve this beauty?
 Did they, like Marsyas, invite some knife-
 wielding god with petty transgressions,
 the crime of a few tunes on Athena’s lost flute?
  
 Or were they simply too poor for deep
 graves, locked gates, and good husbands
 to watch over the mounds of new soil
 tossed toward them and their hunted unborn?
  
 Whoever they were, they’re still with us,
 posing demurely in suits of blood
 and muscle, the bruised shadows
 of what skin they do have, purpling like
  
 crushed petunias as they spread their legs
 and raise their meaty arms to show
 dissected breasts, unfinished infants, sundry
 viscera on the ground about their feet
  
 as if this were Thanksgiving and they
 cornucopias stuffed with squash and fruit.
 And who delivered their sentences?
 Surely not the muses who, at least,
  
 let them keep rococo faces. In 1773
 the womb and the brain were the last outposts
 of the body to be mapped. D’Agoty bought
 the rights to Le Blon’s technique of printing
  
 mezzotints and gave these ladies homes
 in scientific texts, but anatomists believed
 D’Agoty’s prints too gorgeous to be accurate.
 Perhaps that’s why they open other wounds
  
 so easily in us. All so like the single rabbit
 I downed at twenty with a borrowed rifle,
 and then was obligated to see skinned,
 first scoring the length of the spine,
  
 then peeling the fur in one steaming piece,
 while the perverse uncle who clearly desired
 to touch me, instead held up a dripping pelt
 in one hand, and in the other, a flayed carcass
  
 still wrapped in its bundle of muscle like a gift.

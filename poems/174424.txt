title : Astrophil and Stella 23

author : Sir Philip Sidney

text : 
The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness 
Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes, 
Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise, 
With idle pains and missing aim do guess. 
Some, that know how my spring I did address, 
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies; 
Others, because the prince my service tries, 
Think that I think state errors to redress; 
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei 
Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei 
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage. 
O fool or over-wise! alas, the race 
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start 
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.

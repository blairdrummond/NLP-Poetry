Sonnet

Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be, 
And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet, 
Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet 
More oft than to a chamber melody. 
Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me 
To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet: 
My Muse and I must you of duty greet 
With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully. 
Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed; 
By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot, 
Nor blam'd for blood, nor sham'd for sinful deed; 
And that you know I envy you no lot 
Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i 
Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.

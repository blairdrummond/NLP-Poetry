title : Voices of the Air

author : Katherine Mansfield

text : 
But then there comes that moment rare 
When, for no cause that I can find, 
The little voices of the air 
Sound above all the sea and wind. 

The sea and wind do then obey 
And sighing, sighing double notes 
Of double basses, content to play 
A droning chord for the little throats— 

The little throats that sing and rise 
Up into the light with lovely ease 
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise 
To hear and know themselves for these— 

For these little voices: the bee, the fly, 
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks, 
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by, 
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes.

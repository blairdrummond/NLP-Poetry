title : The Origin of Order

Stellar dust has settled. 
It is green underwater now in the leaves 
Of the yellow crowfoot. Its vacancies are gathered together 
Under pine litter as emerging flower of the pink arbutus. 
It has gained the power to make itself again 
In the bone-filled egg of osprey and teal. 

One could say this toothpick grasshopper 
Is a cloud of decayed nebula congealed and perching 
On his female mating. The tortoise beetle, 
Leaving the stripped veins of morning glory vines 
Like licked bones, is a straw-colored swirl 
Of clever gases. 

At this moment there are dead stars seeing 
Themselves as marsh and forest in the eyes 
Of muskrat and shrew, disintegrated suns 
Making songs all night long in the throats 
Of crawfish frogs, in the rubbings and gratings 
Of the red-legged locust. There are spirits of orbiting 
Rock in the shells of pointed winkles 
And apple snails, ghosts of extinct comets caught 
In the leap of darting hare and bobcat, revolutions 
Of rushing stone contained in the sound of these words. 

The paths of the Pleiades and Coma clusters 
Have been compelled to mathematics by the mind 
Contemplating the nature of itself 
In the motions of stars. The patterns 
Of any starry summer night might be identical 
To the summer heavens circling inside the skull. 
I can feel time speeding now in all directions 
Deeper and deeper into the black oblivion 
Of the electrons directly behind my eyes. 

Flesh of the sky, child of the sky, the mind 
Has been obligated from the beginning 
To create an ordered universe 
As the only possible proof of its own inheritance.

title : Sapphics Against Anger

author : Timothy Steele

text : 
Angered, may I be near a glass of water; 
May my first impulse be to think of Silence, 
Its deities (who are they? do, in fact, they
               Exist? etc.).

May I recall what Aristotle says of
The subject: to give vent to rage is not to 
Release it but to be increasingly prone
               To its incursions.

May I imagine being in the Inferno, 
Hearing it asked: “Virgilio mio, who’s
That sulking with Achilles there?” and hearing 
               Virgil say: “Dante,

That fellow, at the slightest provocation,
Slammed phone receivers down, and waved his arms like 
A madman. What Attila did to Europe,
               What Genghis Khan did

To Asia, that poor dope did to his marriage.” 
May I, that is, put learning to good purpose, 
Mindful that melancholy is a sin, though
               Stylish at present.

Better than rage is the post-dinner quiet,
The sink’s warm turbulence, the streaming platters, 
The suds rehearsing down the drain in spirals 
               In the last rinsing.

For what is, after all, the good life save that 
Conducted thoughtfully, and what is passion 
If not the holiest of powers, sustaining
               Only if mastered.

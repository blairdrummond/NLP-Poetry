for Hank
The General’s men sit at the door. Her eyes 
Are fat with belladonna. She’s naked 
Except for the small painted turtles 
That are drinking a flammable cloud 
Of rum and milk from her navel. 

The ships out in the harbor 
Are loosely allied 
Like casks floating in bilge. 
The occasional light on a ship 
Winks. In the empty room of the manuscript 
Someone is grooming you 
For the long entrance into the dark city. 

They’ll hang the General. 
Then with torches they’ll search for his children. 
Men and women 
Are seen jumping from the burning hotel. 
Journalists, in no hurry, 
Elect to take the elevator. They walk 
Out of the building, stepping over corpses. . . 
You are listening to loud bells. 

The corpses get up and follow the journalists. 
It’s unfair that while rehearsing 
For death they actually succumbed to it. 
But no one sobs. 
Shirts and dresses billowing as they fall. 
Something inhuman in you watched it all. 
And whatever it is that watches, 
It has kept you from loneliness like a mob.

title : Chamber Thicket

text : 
As we sat at the feet of the string quartet,   
in their living room, on a winter night,   
through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps   
and tips and shudders came up, and the candle-scent   
air was thick-alive with pearwood,   
ebony, spruce, poplar, and horse   
howled, and cat skreeled, and then,   
when the Grösse Fugue was around us, under us,   
over us, in us, I felt I was hearing   
the genes of my birth-family, pulled, keening   
and grieving and scathing, along each other,   
scraping and craving, I felt myself held in that   
woods of hating longing, and I knew   
and knew myself, and my parents, and their parents,   
there—and then, at a distance, I sensed,   
as if it were thirty years ago,   
a being, far off yet, oblique-approaching,   
straying toward, and then not toward,   
and then toward this place, like a wandering dreaming   
herdsman, my husband. And I almost wanted   
to warn him away, to call out to him   
to go back whence he came, into some calmer life,   
but his beauty was too moving to me,   
and I wanted too much to not be alone, in the   
covert, any more, and so I prayed him   
come to me, I bid him hasten, and good welcome.

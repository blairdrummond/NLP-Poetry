title : Monster [It's possible I misconstrued you]

author : Brook Emery

text : 
It’s possible I misconstrued you,
  
 laid too much emphasis on the uniqueness of a birth, 
 failed to acknowledge circumstance could corrupt, sustain;
 I indulged myself in accusations against an absolute.
  
 I don’t believe what I then believed. You are not responsible
  
 for Leibniz or the Lisbon quake, for the twenty-six-eyed
 and sixty-arsed box jellyfish, that the cosmos
 is shaped like a soccer ball; or for the dosido
 of right and wrong around the garden bed.
  
 You are not the monster I thought you were,
  
 not by definition or necessity the one immutable.
 You are a creator caught in a creator’s net, in fact
 a creature. Every horror has its own pathology, 
  
 the disease infects the flock. Prey present as predators,  
 the malefactors replicate even as the angels 
 experiment with cures. Each encounter pulls against reductive story,
 says I will not, I am just (an instant, an instance),
  
 and reference skews on maps not drawn to scale.
  
 I know saintliness exists. It’s all around me.
 My next door neighbours in their simple modesty,
 the lady down the street who is always
 helping someone older than herself. Even the slow
 judicial process conceives it natural to be better 
 than we are. I’m trying to shoo the gloomy birds away 
  
 but crows repeat about me on the lawn; and the vulture
 and the kite, the cuckoo and the owl: should I have given up the ghost 
 when I was drawn from the womb?

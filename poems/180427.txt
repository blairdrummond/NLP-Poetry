   SCENE ONE: Open-air court in the ancient city of Athens. The accused arrive 
                      and proceed among curses and cries of Death! Death! 

   SCENE TWO: A jail in the same city, beneath the Acropolis, walls half-eaten by 
                      dampness. On the ground, a miserly straw mat and in the corner, 
                      an earthenware jar of water. On the outside wall, a shadow: the 
                      guard. 

SCENE THREE: Constantinople. In the harem of the Holy Place, in candlelight, 
                      the Queen throws a pouch of gold coins to the Head Eunuch 
                      who bows and looks at her significantly. By the open door, his 
                      men at the ready. 

   SCENE FOUR: Drawing room of a large Monastery. Oblong table, the abbot at 
                      its head. Sweaty monks come and go bringing news: a crowd 
                      spills into the streets, setting fires, destroying everything. 

   SCENE FIVE: Nauplio. Greek and Bavarian officers outside the King’s quarters 
                      converse in low tones. A messenger takes the dispatch and heads 
                      toward the steps that lead on high to Palamidi. 

    SCENE SIX: In front of an old and empty lot in contemporary Athens, a 
                      crowd, motley with priests and bishops, gathers to cast a stone, 
                      “the stone of anathema.”

SCENE SEVEN: Low buildings of EAT/ESA. In the courtyard, drunken soldiers. 
                      Braying and lewd posturing. The officer leaving some cell says 
                      something to the military doctor. Behind them thuds and cries 
                      are heard.

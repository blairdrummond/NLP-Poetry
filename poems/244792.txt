wedged in the top branches, rain still sighing
             to earth as a dissolute sky dissolves,
 a mozambican woman turns mother,
             her water breaking loose to pool with the flood
  
 licking the trunk below, a country-sized
             puddle calls forth the child whose name, the mother
 vowed, would not be drowned, no matter how
             high she had to climb. my mother’s water
  
 washed her bare yellow bathroom tile many
             years ago, a diluvial warning
 of my struggle to arrive. we fought to
             get me out, and have been tugging at each
  
 other ever since, tethered by a cord
             that simply thickens when it’s cut. we
 descended then, thirsting, churning, not into
             the waters that hound the mozambican
  
 mother, baying her and her baby in
             the tree, but into that enduring ocean
 in which—as mother, daughter, or both—a
             woman’s only choices are drink or swim.

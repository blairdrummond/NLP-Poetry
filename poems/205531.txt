text : 
I wanted so ably 
to reassure you, I wanted 
the man you took to be me, 

to comfort you, and got 
up, and went to the window, 
pushed back, as you asked me to, 

the curtain, to see 
the outline of the trees 
in the night outside. 

The light, love, 
the light we felt then, 
greyly, was it, that 

came in, on us, not 
merely my hands or yours, 
or a wetness so comfortable, 

but in the dark then 
as you slept, the grey 
figure came so close 

and leaned over, 
between us, as you 
slept, restless, and 

my own face had to 
see it, and be seen by it, 
the man it was, your 

grey lost tired bewildered 
brother, unused, untaken— 
hated by love, and dead, 

but not dead, for an 
instant, saw me, myself 
the intruder, as he was not. 

I tried to say, it is 
all right, she is 
happy, you are no longer 

needed. I said, 
he is dead, and he 
went as you shifted 

and woke, at first afraid, 
then knew by my own knowing 
what had happened— 

and the light then 
of the sun coming 
for another morning 
in the world.

Written on a slat of a railway car: 

If some time someone should find pearls 
threaded on a blood-red string of silk 
which, near the throat, runs all the thinner 
like life’s own path until it’s gone 
somewhere in a fog and can’t be seen—   

If someone should find these pearls   
let him know how—cool, aloof—they lit up   
the eighteen-year-old, impatient heart   
of the Paris dancing girl, Marie. 

Now, dragged through unknown Poland—
I’m throwing my pearls through the grate. 

If they’re found by a young man— 
let these pearls adorn his girlfriend. 
If they’re found by a girl—
let her wear them; they belong to her. 
And if they’re found by an old man— 
let him, for these pearls, recite a prayer.

title : Chain of Women

author : Annie Finch

text : 
These are the seasons Persephone promised
as she turned on her heelâ€”
the ones that darken, till green no longer
bandages what I feel.

Now touches of gold stipple the branches,
promising weeks of time
to fade through, finding the footprints
she left as she turned to climb.

text : 
The song 
 sparrow puts all his
 saying
 into one
 repeated song:
 what
  
 variations, subtleties
 he manages,
 to encompass denser
 meanings, I’m 
 too coarse
 to catch: it’s
  
 one song, an over-reach
 from which
 all possibilities,
 like filaments,
 depend:
 killing,
  
 nesting, dying,
 sun or cloud,
 figure up
 and become
 song—simple, hard:
 removed.

Poems for Weddings



Throw away thy rod, 
Throw away thy wrath: 
                  O my God, 
Take the gentle path. 

For my heart's desire 
Unto thine is bent: 
                  I aspire 
To a full consent. 

Not a word or look 
I affect to own, 
                  But by book, 
And thy book alone. 

Though I fail, I weep: 
Though I halt in pace, 
                  Yet I creep 
To the throne of grace. 

Then let wrath remove; 
Love will do the deed: 
                  For with love 
Stony hearts will bleed. 

Love is swift of foot; 
Love's a man of war, 
                  And can shoot, 
And can hit from far. 

Who can 'scape his bow? 
That which wrought on thee, 
                  Brought thee low, 
Needs must work on me. 

Throw away thy rod; 
Though man frailties hath, 
         Thou art God: 
Throw away thy wrath.

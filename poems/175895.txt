title : The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee

author : N. Scott Momaday

text : 
I am a feather on the bright sky 
I am the blue horse that runs in the plain 
I am the fish that rolls, shining, in the water 
I am the shadow that follows a child 
I am the evening light, the lustre of meadows 
I am an eagle playing with the wind 
I am a cluster of bright beads 
I am the farthest star 
I am the cold of dawn 
I am the roaring of the rain 
I am the glitter on the crust of the snow 
I am the long track of the moon in a lake 
I am a flame of four colors 
I am a deer standing away in the dusk 
I am a field of sumac and the pomme blanche 
I am an angle of geese in the winter sky 
I am the hunger of a young wolf 
I am the whole dream of these things 
You see, I am alive, I am alive 
I stand in good relation to the earth 
I stand in good relation to the gods 
I stand in good relation to all that is beautiful 
I stand in good relation to the daughter of Tsen-tainte 
You see, I am alive, I am alive

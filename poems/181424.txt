title : The Hypnotist's Daughter

At the London Zoo a toddler falls over the rail 
of the Primate World only if you close your eyes 

and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle 
her long dark arm around him only this one time 

while the others stay away. The zookeeper says 
she lost a baby earlier this year only just barely 

and they’ve been waiting months for her tits to dry. 
The boy’s mother watches from above 

only when I say so the thirty minutes it takes 
the right person to lower the right ladder down 

only as a last resort. In the interim a newscaster 
whose station carries it live only if you promise 

not to let go reports that dolphins and sometimes 
certain whales rescue people stranded at sea 

only when I close my eyes lift them to the air 
when they need breathing or swim them close enough 

to land. In the interim I imagine the span of time 
from when the smooth hard snout finds me 

and begins to push only if you promise not to tell 
to when we come into view of a shore only this once 

any shore. In the interim I pray for what should come 
to come. I pray for the cat to come out from under 

the floorboards  only every once in a while to come 
down from the tall maple, to come back alive 

only if you say so in one piece, still in her collar. 
I pray to be saved, to be sent far away, to be 

allowed to just stay home only another month or two 
just stay home and erase the objects in each room 

with my mind while holding them in my hands 
only a matter of time now. I do want to hold them 

in my hands, to hold them to my lungs by way 
of deep breath only since July and a deeper sense 

of inhalation. I pray for you only just this once 
to press out from the small veins at the back of my eyes 

only you back out into the world. I pray for you 
to come and sit by me only a few more minutes now.

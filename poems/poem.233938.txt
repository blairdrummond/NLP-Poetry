Rhymed Stanza

If Cynthia be a queen, a princess, and supreme, 
Keep these among the rest, or say it was a dream, 
For those that like, expound, and those that loathe express 
Meanings according as their minds are moved more or less; 
For writing what thou art, or showing what thou were, 
Adds to the one disdain, to the other but despair, 
      Thy mind of neither needs, in both seeing it exceeds.

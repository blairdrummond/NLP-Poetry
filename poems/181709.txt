title : A Lock of Her Hair

As a hoodoo-voodoo, get-you-back-to-me tool, 
this hank’s thankless task is vast, 
a head down to the ground impossibility, possibly, 
since what I’m thinking of is your toe pad pinknesses too, 
your soup hots and round-and-rounds, the fine 
and perfect poundage of you on my paws, the very cause 
and problem I moan and bemoan 
the absence of. For Love, above the head 
this reddish coil once lavishly wore, there’s an air so far away 
it’s sad for me to even think the same sun’s rays play 
where it was and do to you what I would do 
if I were there or you were here. Still, some thrills 
remembered do resemble thrills, one hopes, and the ropes 
of it that gently fell around me bound me so well 
no hell of miles can defile this dream I dream. I mean 
the anyway DNA I can find of you. I mean the home 
of bones and blood that holds the whole of you 
and which this fizzed-up missive means to conjure, missy, 
my world in a curl, girl, this man oh man half man I am 
when you’re gone.

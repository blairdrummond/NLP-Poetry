title : Robert Frost at Eighty

author : Peter Boyle

text : 
I think there are poems greater and stranger than any I have known.
 I would like to find them.
 They are not on the greying paper of old books
 or chanted on obscure lips.
 They are not in the language of mermaids
 or the sharp-tongued adjectives of vanishing.
 They run like torn threads along paving stones.
 They are cracked as the skull of an old man.
 They stir in the mirror
 at fifty,
 at eighty.
 My ear keeps trying to hear them
 but the seafront is cold.
 The tide moves in.
 They migrate like crows at a cricket ground.
 They knock at the door when I am out.
  
 I have done with craft.
 How can I front ghosts with cleverness,
 the slick glide of paradox and rhyme
 that transforms prejudice
 to brittle gems of seeming wisdom?
  
 Though I bury all I own or hold close
 though my skin outlives the trees
 though the lines fall shattering the stone
 I cannot catch them.
 They have the lilting accent
 of a house I saw but never entered.
 They are the sounds a child hears –
 the water, the afternoon, the sky.
 I watch them now
 trickling through the open mirror.
 Sometimes, but almost never
 we touch what we desire.

title : Your World

author : Georgia Douglas Johnson

text : 
Your world is as big as you make it. 
 I know, for I used to abide
 In the narrowest nest in a corner, 
 My wings pressing close to my side. 
  
 But I sighted the distant horizon 
 Where the skyline encircled the sea 
 And I throbbed with a burning desire 
 To travel this immensity. 
  
 I battered the cordons around me 
 And cradled my wings on the breeze, 
 Then soared to the uttermost reaches 
 With rapture, with power, with ease!

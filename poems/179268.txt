title : Want Song

author : Lance Larsen

text : 
Two musics washing over me, and morning asks,   
which loneliness comes closest to the inky 
chromatics inside you? How can I answer?   
The cricket in the tarantula’s cage 
chirrs the next world. 
Meanwhile, scraps of Chopin float 
up the stairs on my wife’s trilling fingers 
which played me whole 
worlds ago, last night, when I was buried in we.

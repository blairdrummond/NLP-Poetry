I was lying loose from God. Strange is it not best   
Beloved, in the New World, in this skinny life, 

Intemperate with chance, my spirit quickens   
For the fall’s estate. In India, the half 

Hour is the hour, we were like that then— 
Jammed wrong & wrong in the diurnal 

Mangy chambers of our carnall 
Hearts, the rose robes rustling loose as velvet 

Curtains at the stage prow, passing   
Into the strange salt air of an Indian 

Ocean, hoarding kindling, heading   
West with hours, later than we might 

Have known, counting tins of meats & oil left,   
If they should lose or last the night.

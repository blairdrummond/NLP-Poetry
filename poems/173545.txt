title : And If I Did, What Then?

author : George Gascoigne

“And if I did, what then? 
Are you aggriev’d therefore? 
The sea hath fish for every man, 
And what would you have more?” 

   Thus did my mistress once, 
Amaze my mind with doubt; 
And popp’d a question for the nonce 
To beat my brains about. 

   Whereto I thus replied: 
“Each fisherman can wish 
That all the seas at every tide 
Were his alone to fish. 

   “And so did I (in vain) 
But since it may not be, 
Let such fish there as find the gain, 
And leave the loss for me. 

   “And with such luck and loss 
I will content myself, 
Till tides of turning time may toss 
Such fishers on the shelf. 

   “And when they stick on sands, 
That every man may see, 
Then will I laugh and clap my hands, 
As they do now at me.”

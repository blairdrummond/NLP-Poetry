title : The Tapestry

—for Pilar Coover  
Me, when I think of you I see   
Alley cats in your kitchen, 
God weeping at your openings,   
Individual acts of imagination, never   
Culligan men under 

Floorboards slipping hallucinogens into your water.   
Let me say I have imagined you 
Undressing guests before mirrors 
To let their dragonfly bodies 
Escape from human shells.

EAST OF EDEN
 is mountains & desert
 until you cross the passes into India  .
 It is 3 o’clock in the afternoon or
 twenty of 8 at night, depending
                    which clock you believe  .
  
 AND WEST IS WEST
 It’s where the cups and saucers are,
 the plates, the knives and forks  .
  
                    The turkey sandwich comes alone
                    or with onions if you like
 The old newspaperman always takes his hat off
 & lays it atop the cigarette machine;
 the younger, so-hip journalist, leaves his on
 old-style .

The old man sits down in the corner, puts
                   his hat back on. No challenge, but
                         it’s visible, the beau geste  .
                                        The cigarette
 hangs from the side of the younger man’s mouth, he’s
 putting himself on  .
                    East of Eden is mountains & desert & every
                    thing creeps up on you & comes in the night,
                                       unexpectedly  .
 when one would least put out his hand
 to offer, or to defend  .

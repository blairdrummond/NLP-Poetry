Rhymed Stanza

Dora's gone to Ireland
    Through the sleet and snow; 
Promptly she has gone there 
    In a ship, although
Why she's gone to Ireland
    Dora does not know.

That was where, yea, Ireland, 
    Dora wished to be:
When she felt, in lone times, 
    Shoots of misery,
Often there, in Ireland,
    Dora wished to be.

Hence she's gone to Ireland,
    Since she meant to go,
Through the drift and darkness
    Onward labouring, though 
That she's gone to Ireland
    Dora does not know.

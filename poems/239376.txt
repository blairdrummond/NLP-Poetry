title : Fire Victim

author : Ned Balbo

text : 
Once, boarding the train to New York City, 
The aisle crowded and all seats filled, I glimpsed 
An open space—more pushing, stuck in place— 
And then saw why: a man, face peeled away, 
Sewn back in haste, skin grafts that smeared like wax 
Spattered and frozen, one eye flesh-filled, smooth, 
One cold eye toward the window. Cramped, shoved hard, 
I, too, passed up the seat, the place, and fought on 
Through to the next car, and the next, but now 
I wonder why the fire that could have killed him 
Spared him, burns scarred over; if a life 
Is what he calls this space through which he moves, 
Dark space we dared not enter, and what fire 
Burns in him when he sees us move away.

text : 
the relationship between   
       blackbird and fencepost, between   
the cow and its egret, the field   
       and wildflowers overrunning the field—   
so little depends upon their trust.   

       Here, in God we trust   
to keep our cash and thoughts in line—   
       in the sky, an unexplained white line   
could be the first of many omens.   
       But this is no country for omens,   

the line as chalky as the moon,   
       bleak and useless as the moon   
now rising like a breath of cold air . . .   
       There is gullibility in the air.

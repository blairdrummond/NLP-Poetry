—I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying 
To make you hear. Your ears are soft and small   
And listen to an old man not at all, 
They want the young men’s whispering and sighing.   
But see the roses on your trellis dying 
And hear the spectral singing of the moon; 
For I must have my lovely lady soon, 
I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying. 

—I am a lady young in beauty waiting   
Until my truelove comes, and then we kiss.   
But what grey man among the vines is this   
Whose words are dry and faint as in a dream?   
Back from my trellis, Sir, before I scream!   
I am a lady young in beauty waiting.

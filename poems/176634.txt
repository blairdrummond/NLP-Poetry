title : The Here and Now

author : Theodore Weiss

text : 
for Yehuda Amichai
Though you live in a little country,   
crammed and crisscrossed with debris,   
the past oppressive many times over— 
where you buy your grapes David, pausing, 
eyes a fiery dark girl, a lusty song   
riding his breath, the old dance urgent   
at his body; where you buy your bread   
Christ, stumbling, stoops to heavy lumber— 
you insist on your own loves and griefs,   
on living your own life. 
                                           So you love 
this city, but mainly as it goes on   
living its own life, across its roofs 
the lines flapping, not gaudy banners,   
but sheets and diapers, pants and slips,   
as if rehearsing private pleasures. 

And though you know you cannot win,   
you play the game with all the skill   
and love that you can muster, hoping   
to keep it, keep it going, whatever   
the fierceness in it, while you learn   
the repertoire of your opponent’s wrist,   
the repertoire your own commands,   
with every stroke surprising you,   
as in a woman’s glance the abundance   
glinting of her passion stored away. 

Those opposing roles, victor, victim   
both, when they require re-enacting, 
the moon as ever plays the luminous dome   
above your god-and-man-scarred rock,   
responsive to each nuance of the light   
informing it with this, the latest scene. 

The sweat you’ve shared between you,   
juices drying on your hands and moon- 
lit belly, swirls out of the rutted, stain- 
stiff sheets a fragrance stronger, more   
anointing, than the myrrh, the frank- 
incense the magi brought, a gleam 
that would eclipse their beaten gold.

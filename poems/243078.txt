title : How We Heard the Name

author : Alan Dugan

text : 
The river brought down
 dead horses, dead men
 and military debris,
 indicative of war
 or official acts upstream,
 but it went by, it all 
 goes by, that is the thing
 about the river. Then 
 a soldier on a log
 went by. He seemed drunk
 and we asked him Why
 had he and this junk
 come down to us so
 from the past upstream.
 “Friends,” he said, “the great
 Battle of Granicus
 has just been won
 by all of the Greeks except
 the Lacedaemonians and
 myself: this is a joke
 between me and a man
 named Alexander, whom
 all of you ba bas
 will hear of as a god.”

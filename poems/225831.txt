title : Crossing the Square

Squinting through eye-slits in our balaclavas,   
we lurch across Washington Square Park   
hunched against the wind, two hooded figures   
caught in the monochrome, carrying sacks 

of fruit, as we’ve done for years. The frosted, starch- 
stiff sycamores make a lean Christmas tree 
seem to bulk larger, tilted under the arch 
and still lit in three colors. Once in January, 

we found a feather here and stuffed the quill   
in twigs to recall that jay. The musical fountain   
is here, its water gone, a limestone circle 
now. Though rap succeeds the bluegrass strains 

we’ve played in it, new praise evokes old sounds.   
White branches mimic visions of past storms; 
some say they’ve heard ghosts moan above this ground,   
once a potter’s field. No two stones are the same, 

of course: the drums, the tawny pears we hold,   
are old masks for new things. Still, in a world   
where fretted houses with façades are leveled   
for condominiums, not much has altered 

here. At least it’s faithful to imagined 
views. And, after all, we know the sycamore 
will screen the sky in a receding wind. 
Now, trekking home through grit that’s mounting higher, 

faces upturned to test the whirling snow, 
in new masks, we whistle to make breath-clouds form   
and disappear, and form again, and O,   
my love, there’s sun in the crook of your arm.

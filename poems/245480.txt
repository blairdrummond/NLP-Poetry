title : Multiple Sclerosis

author : Cynthia Huntington

text : 
For ten years I would not say the name.
 I said: episode. Said: setback, incident,
 exacerbation—anything but be specific
 in the way this is specific, not a theory
 or description, but a diagnosis.
 I said: muscle, weakness, numbness, fatigue.
 I said vertigo, neuritis, lesion, spasm.
 Remission. Progression. Recurrence. Deficit.
  
 But the name, the ugly sound of it, I refused.
 There are two words. The last one means: scarring.
 It means what grows hard, and cannot be repaired.
 The first one means: repeating, or myriad,
 consisting of many parts, increasing in number,
 happening over and over, without end.

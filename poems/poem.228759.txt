Elegy, Pastoral

      Where Claribel low-lieth
      The breezes pause and die,
      Letting the rose-leaves fall:
But the solemn oak-tree sigheth,
      Thick-leaved, ambrosial,
      With an ancient melody
      Of an inward agony,
Where Claribel low-lieth.

At eve the beetle boometh
      Athwart the thicket lone:
At noon the wild bee hummeth
      About the moss'd headstone:
At midnight the moon cometh,
      And looketh down alone.
Her song the lintwhite swelleth,
The clear-voiced mavis dwelleth,
      The callow throstle lispeth,
The slumbrous wave outwelleth,
      The babbling runnel crispeth,
The hollow grot replieth
      Where Claribel low-lieth.

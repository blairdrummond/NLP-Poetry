title : The Singers

author : Todd Hearon

text : 
They are not angels 

though they have the hollow look 

         of beings bred on ether. There’s an air 

of cool removal from your life, the hawk’s 

         indifference to the hare’s terror. 

You see it in their palms, raised casually 

         against the fresco’s surface, as to glass 

of submarine or spacecraft, and you see 

         it in their eyes, oracular, that let you pass 

alone to unknown agony. The song 

         they sing is merely time.

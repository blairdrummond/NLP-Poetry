title : Wake Me in South Galway

Wake me in South Galway, or better yet 
In Clare. You'll know the pub I have in mind. 
Improvise a hearse—one of those decrepit 
Postal vans would suit me down to the ground— 
A rust-addled Renault, Kelly green with a splash 
Of Oscar Wilde yellow stirred in to clash 
With the dazzling perfect meadows and limestone 
On the coast road from Kinvara down toward Ballyvaughan. 

Once you've got in off the road at Newquay 
Push aside some barstools and situate me 
Up in front by the door where the musicians sit, 
Their table crowded with pints and a blue teapot, 
A pouch of Drum, some rolling papers and tin 
Whistles. Ask Charlie Piggott to play a tune 
That sounds like loss and Guinness, turf smoke and rain, 
While Brenda dips in among the punters like a hedge-wren. 

Will I hear it? Maybe not. But I hear it now. 
The smoke of the music fills my nostrils, I feel the attuned 
Box and fiddle in harness, pulling the plough 
Of the melody, turning the bog-dark, root-tangled ground. 
Even the ceramic collie on the windowsill 
Cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail 
Of the Galway hooker trills wildly in its frame on the wall, 
Rippling to the salt pulse and seabreeze of a West Clare reel. 

Many a night, two octaves of one tune, 
We sat here side by side, your body awake 
To a jig or slide, me mending the drift of a line 
As the music found a path to my notebook. 
Lost in its lilt and plunge I would disappear 
Into the heathery freedom of a slow air 
Or walk out under the powerful stars to clear 
My head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire. 

When my own session ends, let me leave like that, 
Porous to the wind that blows off the ocean. 
Goodbye to the company and step into the night 
Completed and one-off, like a well-played tune— 
Beyond the purified essence of hearth fires 
Rising from the life of the parish, past smoke and stars, 
Released from everything I've done and known. 
I won't go willingly, it's true, but I'll be gone.

The jungle, from the floor to the canopy,
 Clogs and entwines
 Its every rung and level with rank growth.
 The python dines
 Among an epiphytic gaudery
 And hungry vines.
 On the mizzled hair of the two-toed sloth
 Moss has designs.
 Yet all that climbing tonnage is content-free.
 The top limbs sway as though to write in air,
 But can’t remember what they scribble there.
 Through the savanna’s heat-glaze the herds pause,
 Ripple and shiver,
 Or graze hypnotically, or drop their young,
 Which may deliver
 Their wet thin steps into the lion’s jaws.
 By pool or river
 They stoop at evening side by side among
 The surface quiver
 Of their reflexions as the light withdraws:
 A fable set down in invisible ink;
 They print their shadows on the pool they drink.
 Even the perfect pictures in the shale’s
 Slow-motion traps,
 The filamentous feathers, which one or two
 Sharp hammer taps
 Release, the fish in their meticulous scales,
 The precise maps
 Of leaves, did not direct this rendezvous.
 They’re simply gaps
 In time, and have no part in these details.
 The weird wiwaxias, worms and arthropods
 Were empty of intention as stone gods.
 Once, though, a figure had the thought to crawl
 Out of the day
 Into a cave’s dark reach, its first invoker,
 And there to splay
 His hand against the tallow-glimmered wall,
 And pause to spray
 His mouth’s cargo of spittle and red ochre
 On the array
 Of his five fingers, clear, indelible:
 Author and content of the space displayed,
 The maker’s hand becoming what it made.

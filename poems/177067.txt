title : Deaf-Mute in the Pear Tree

author : P. K. Page

text : 
His clumsy body is a golden fruit 
pendulous in the pear tree   

Blunt fingers among the multitudinous buds   

Adriatic blue the sky above and through 
the forking twigs 

Sun ruddying tree’s trunk, his trunk 
his massive head thick-nobbed with burnished curls   
tight-clenched in bud 

(Painting by Generalíc. Primitive.) 

I watch him prune with silent secateurs 

Boots in the crotch of branches shift their weight   
heavily as oxen in a stall 

Hear small inarticulate mews from his locked mouth   
a kitten in a box 

Pear clippings fall 
                            soundlessly on the ground 
Spring finches sing 
                            soundlessly in the leaves 

A stone. A stone in ears and on his tongue 

Through palm and fingertip he knows the tree’s   
quick springtime pulse 

Smells in its sap the sweet incipient pears 

Pale sunlight’s choppy water glistens on   
his mutely snipping blades 

and flags and scraps of blue 
above him make regatta of the day 

But when he sees his wife’s foreshortened shape   
sudden and silent in the grass below   
uptilt its face to him 

then air is kisses, kisses   

stone dissolves 

his locked throat finds a little door 

and through it feathered joy   
flies screaming like a jay

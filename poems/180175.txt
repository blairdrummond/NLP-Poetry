title : Cat, Failing

author : Robin Robertson

text : 
A figment, a thumbed 
maquette of a cat, some 
ditched plaything, something 
brought in from outside: 
his white fur stiff and grey, 
coming apart at the seams. 
I study the muzzle 
of perished rubber, one ear 
eaten away, his sour body 
lumped like a bean-bag 
leaking thinly 
into a grim towel. I sit 
and watch the light 
degrade in his eyes. 

He tries and fails 
to climb to his chair, shirks 
in one corner of the kitchen, 
cowed, denatured, ceasing to be 
anything like a cat, 
and there's a new look 
in those eyes 
that refuse to meet mine 
and it's the shame of  being 
found out.  Just that. 
And with that 
loss of face 
his face, I see, 
has turned human.

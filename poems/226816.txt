Forgive me, soldier.   
Forgive my right hand   
for pointing you   
to the flawless 
tree line now 
outlined in my brain.   
There was so much   
bloodsky at daybreak 
in Pleiku, but I won’t say 
those infernal guns   
blinded me on that hill. 

Mistakes piled up men like clouds   
pushed to the dark side. 
Sometimes I try to retrace 
them, running 
fingers down the map 
telling less than a woman’s body— 
we followed the grid coordinates 
in some battalion commander’s mind.   
If I could make my mouth 
unsay those orders, 
I’d holler: Don’t 
move a muscle. Stay put, 
keep your fucking head 
down, soldier. 

Ambush. Gutsmoke. 
Last night while making love 
I cried out, Hit the dirt! 
I’ve tried to swallow my tongue. 
You were a greenhorn, so fearless,   
even foolish, & when I said go, 
Henry, you went dancing on a red string   
of bullets from that tree line 
as it moved from a low cloud.

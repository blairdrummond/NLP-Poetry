title : On the Death of Anne Brontë

author : Charlotte Brontë

text : 
THERE 's little joy in life for me, 
      And little terror in the grave; 
I 've lived the parting hour to see 
      Of one I would have died to save. 

Calmly to watch the failing breath, 
      Wishing each sigh might be the last; 
Longing to see the shade of death 
      O'er those belovèd features cast. 

The cloud, the stillness that must part 
      The darling of my life from me; 
And then to thank God from my heart, 
      To thank Him well and fervently; 

Although I knew that we had lost 
      The hope and glory of our life; 
And now, benighted, tempest-tossed, 
      Must bear alone the weary strife.

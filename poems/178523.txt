Poem for Sriram Shamasunder And All of Poetry for the People
It’s a sunlit morning 
with jasmine blooming 
easily 
and a drove of robin redbreasts 
diving into the ivy covering 
what used to be 
a backyard fence 
or doves shoving aside 
the birch tree leaves 
when 
a young man walks among 
the flowers   
to my doorway   
where he knocks   
then stands still   
brilliant in a clean white shirt 

He lifts a soft fist   
to that door   
and knocks again 

He’s come to say this   
was or that   
was   
not   
and what’s   
anyone of us to do   
about what’s done   
what’s past   
but prickling salt to sting   
our eyes 

What’s anyone of us to do   
about what’s done 

And 7-month-old Bingo 
puppy leaps   
and hits   
that clean white shirt   
with muddy paw   
prints here   
and here and there 

And what’s anyone of us to do   
about what’s done   
I say I’ll wash the shirt   
no problem   
two times through   
the delicate blue cycle 
of an old machine   
the shirt spins in the soapy   
suds and spins in rinse 
and spins   
and spins out dry   

not clean 

still marked by accidents   
by energy of whatever serious or trifling cause   
the shirt stays dirty 
from that puppy’s paws 

I take that fine white shirt   
from India   
the threads as soft as baby   
fingers weaving them   
together   
and I wash that shirt   
between   
between the knuckles of my own 
two hands 
I scrub and rub that shirt 
to take the dirty 
markings 
out 

At the pocket   
and around the shoulder seam   
and on both sleeves   
the dirt the paw   
prints tantalize my soap   
my water my sweat   
equity   
invested in the restoration   
of a clean white shirt 
          
And on the eleventh try 
I see no more 
no anything unfortunate 
no dirt 

I hold the limp fine 
cloth 
between the faucet stream 
of water as transparent 
as a wish the moon stayed out 
all day 

How small it has become! 
That clean white shirt! 
How delicate! 
How slight! 
How like a soft fist knocking on my door! 
And now I hang the shirt 
to dry 
as slowly as it needs 
the air 
to work its way 
with everything 
          
It’s clean. 
A clean white shirt 
nobody wanted to spoil 
or soil 
that shirt 
much cleaner now but also 
not the same 
as the first before that shirt 
got hit got hurt 
not perfect 
anymore 
just beautiful 

a clean white shirt 

It’s hard to keep a clean shirt clean.

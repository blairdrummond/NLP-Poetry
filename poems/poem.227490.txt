Common Measure

Wintah, summah, snow er shine,
   Hit's all de same to me,
Ef only I kin call you mine,
   An' keep you by my knee.

Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,
   Content by night an' day,
Ef only I kin see you whaih
   You wait beside de way.

Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,
   My soul will still be free,
Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs
   You walk de worl' wid me.

Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,
   What puny t'ings dey'll be,
Ef w'en I's seemin' all erlone,
   I knows yo' hea't's wid me.

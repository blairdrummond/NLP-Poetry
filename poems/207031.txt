 These photographs are the index of an hour,
            memory clocked along negative margins:
                        one through twelve, one through twelve, one
                         through twelve.
  
 Even in a sequence there is choice,
           as when I chose not to photograph silences between words—
  
 choice of the parted lips—
           or choose now a sequence out of time.
                        Scissors: chopped time.
  
 Rearrangement is good:
           You are characters in a drama called then.
  
 You are figures for mythology.
           I shall make Phaedra blonde, Theseus dark, Hippolytus
           blonde—
  
 blue eyes: blue eyes; that will do—
           Antigone singing in the graveyard wind,
  
 a twelve-year old who is Jocasta alternate weeks.
           Neither imagination nor my willing flesh can move this
           hand
  
 one fraction of an inch;
           a shift of stance could have juxtaposed mouths.
                         The fixed frame
  
 is the drama:
            Hippolytus at banquet;
                    Phaedra in her chamber,
                                  behind her that painting blurred
  
 into an omen,
           as if Theseus were Creon, Meleager, shepherd, faun;
                    Oedipus barefoot, hairskin beast;
                              Antigone maenad, Helen, Artemis.
  
                                        Only out-of-focus figures move.

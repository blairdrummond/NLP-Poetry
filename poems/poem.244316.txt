Alliteration

Earnest, earthless, equal, attuneable, ' vaulty, voluminous, . . . stupendous
 Evening strains to be time's vast, ' womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.
 Her fond yellow hornlight wound to the west, ' her wild hollow hoarlight hung to the height
 Waste; her earliest stars, earl-stars, ' stars principal, overbend us,
 Fire-featuring heaven. For earth ' her being as unbound, her dapple is at an end, as-
 tray or aswarm, all throughther, in throngs; ' self in self steeped and pashed - quite 
 Disremembering, dismembering, ' all now. Heart, you round me right
 With: Our evening is over us; our night ' whelms, whelms, and will end us.
 Only the beak-leaved boughs dragonish ' damask the tool-smooth bleak light; black,
 Ever so black on it. Our tale, O our oracle! ' Let life, waned, ah let life wind
 Off her once skeined stained veined variety ' upon all on two spools; part, pen, pack
 Now her all in two flocks, two folds - black, white; ' right, wrong; reckon but, reck but, mind
 But these two; ware of a world where but these ' two tell, each off the other; of a rack
 Where, selfwrung, selfstrung, sheathe- and shelterless, ' thoughts against thoughts in groans grind.

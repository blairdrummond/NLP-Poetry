Forbear, bold youth, all's Heaven here,
   And what you do aver,
To others, courtship may appear,
   'Tis sacriledge to her.

She is a publick deity,
   And were't not very odd
She should depose her self to be
   A pretty household god?

First make the sun in private shine,
   And bid the world adieu,
That so he may his beams confine
   In complement to you.

But if of that you do despair,
   Think how you did amiss,
To strive to fix her beams which are
   More bright and large than this.

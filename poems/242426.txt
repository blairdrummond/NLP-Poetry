We snort all our coke
 on the way to the party.
 We bring the new album.
 We dance while we listen.
  
 The band is two women
 whose husbands control them.
 They do not speak our language.
 Each syllable’s an obstacle.
  
 They are in love with a man.
 He is in love with another.
 But they’re in no hurry.
 They could wait forever.
  
 And when they are out
 on the make for a lover,
 they’ll always find him.
 They are the tigers.
  
 We are stoned too stoned to.
 We dance till we’re tired
 and listen to lyrics
 we mouth like a language.
  
 What we feel, when we
 hear them, is inexpressible.
 We can’t put into words.
 Maybe our dances show it.
  
 ABBA lives for their music.
 We long for each other.
 They see what we’re doing.
 They put it on record.
  
 They play it, we listen.
 We are absolutely stunned.
 We feel, and they know
 more than anyone can say.

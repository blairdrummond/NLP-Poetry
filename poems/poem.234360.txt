(from Twelfth Night)
When that I was and a little tiny boy, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
A foolish thing was but a toy, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came to man's estate, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came, alas! to wive, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
By swaggering could I never thrive, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came unto my beds, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
With toss-pots still had drunken heads, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

A great while ago the world begun, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
But that's all one, our play is done, 
    And we'll strive to please you every day.

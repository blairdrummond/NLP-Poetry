title : The Night City

author : W. S. Graham

text : 
Unmet at Euston in a dream
 Of London under Turner’s steam
 Misting the iron gantries, I
 Found myself running away
 From Scotland into the golden city.
  
 I ran down Gray’s Inn Road and ran
 Till I was under a black bridge.
 This was me at nineteen
 Late at night arriving between
 The buildings of the City of London.
  
 And the I (O I have fallen down)
 Fell in my dream beside the Bank
 Of England’s wall to be, me
 With my money belt of Northern ice.
 I found Eliot and he said yes
  
 And sprang into a Holmes cab.
 Boswell passed me in the fog
 Going to visit Whistler who
 Was with John Donne who had just seen
 Paul Potts shouting on Soho Green.
  
 Midnight. I hear the moon
 Light chiming on St Paul’s.
  
 The City is empty. Night
 Watchmen are drinking their tea,
  
 The Fire had burnt out.
 The Plague’s pits had closed
 And gone into literature.
  
 Between the big buildings 
 I sat like a flea crouched
 In the stopped works of a watch.

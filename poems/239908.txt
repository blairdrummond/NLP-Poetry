title : The Consent

author : Howard Nemerov

text : 
Late in November, on a single night
 Not even near to freezing, the ginkgo trees
 That stand along the walk drop all their leaves
 In one consent, and neither to rain nor to wind
 But as though to time alone: the golden and green
 Leaves litter the lawn today, that yesterday
 Had spread aloft their fluttering fans of light.
 Â 
 What signal from the stars? What senses took it in?
 What in those wooden motives so decided
 To strike their leaves, to down their leaves,
 Rebellion or surrender? and if this 
 Can happen thus, what race shall be exempt?
 What use to learn the lessons taught by time.
 If a star at any time may tell us: Now.

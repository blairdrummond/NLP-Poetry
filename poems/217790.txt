Before my first communion, I clung to doubt 
         as Satan spider-like stalked 
                the orb of dark surrounding Eden 

for a wormhole into paradise. 
       God had formed me from gel in my mother’s womb, 
                injected by my dad’s smart shoot. 

They swapped sighs until 
         I came, smaller than a bite of burger. 
                Quietly, I grew till my lungs were done 

then the Lord sailed a soul 
         like a lit arrow to inhabit me. 
                Maybe that piercing 

made me howl at birth, 
         or the masked creatures whose scalpel 
                cut a lightning bolt to free me. 

I was hoisted by the heels and swatted, fed 
         and hauled around. Time-lapse photos show 
                my fingers grow past crayon outlines, 

my feet come to fill spike heels. 
         Eventually, I lurched out 
                to kiss the wrong mouths, get stewed, 

and sulk around. Christ always stood 
         to one side with a glass of water. 
                I swatted the sap away. 

When my thirst got great enough to ask, 
         a clear stream welled up inside, 
                some jade wave buoyed me forward, 

and I found myself upright 
         in the instant, with a garden 
                inside my own ribs aflourish. 

There, the arbor leafs. 
         The vines push out plump grapes. 
                You are loved, someone said. Take that 

                and eat it.

					1. Now you are all here you might as well know this is America we do what we like.2. Be spontaneous it is the right way.3. Mothers you have met before still defy comprehension.4. Our scene is foggy we are asking you to clarify.5. Explains geomoetry of life. Where? At Catholic Worker.6. Very glad you came. With our mouths full of cornflakes we were expecting an emergency.7. Cynics declare you are in Greece.8. Better get back quick before the place is all used up.9. The night court: the mumbling judge: confused.10. Well-wishers are there to meet you head on.11. For the journal: soldiers, harbingers of change.12. You came just in time, the score is even.13. None of the machines has yet been broken.14. Come on we know you have seen Popes.15. People have been a little self-conscious around here in the emergency.16. Who cares what the cynics declare. But you have been in Greece.

title : Cornflowers

She says my hair smells
like corn tortillas.
I raise an eyebrow.
After all those honeysuckle
and papaya shampoos,
I can’t believe my scalp
hasn’t soaked up
the scent of blossom
or the perfume of rainfall.
No, she’s my mother,
and she insists
that even as a little girl,
my whole bedroom breathed
corn tortillas.
 
Pressing nose to pillowcase,
I search for masa,
reach back before
molcajete and plow
to a dusky meadow,
its bed of soil flecked
with teosinte,
ancestor grasses.
 
Up through the dark
follicles of my skull
covered in sun-cracked husks,
push the black-brown silk strands,
cocooning thirsty kernels.
Maíz sprouts into fields of thought
bearing hybrid rows of words
that fall like teeth
from the mouths of the dead.

title : Springtime in the Rockies, Lichen

author : Lew Welch

text : 
All these years I overlooked them in the
 racket of the rest, this
 symbiotic splash of plant and fungus feeding
 on rock, on sun, a little moisture, air —
 tiny acid-factories dissolving
 salt from living rocks and
 eating them.
  
 Here they are, blooming!
 Trail rock, talus and scree, all dusted with it:
 rust, ivory, brilliant yellow-green, and 
 cliffs like murals!
 Huge panels streaked and patched, quietly
 with shooting-stars and lupine at the base.
  
 Closer, with the glass, a city of cups!
 Clumps of mushrooms and where do the
 plants begin? Why are they doing this?
 In this big sky and all around me peaks &
 the melting glaciers, why am I made to
 kneel and peer at Tiny?
  
 These are the stamps of the final envelope.
  
 How can the poisons reach them?
 In such thin air, how can they care for the
 loss of a million breaths?
 What, possibly, could make their ground more bare?
  
 Let it all die.
  
 The hushed globe will wait and wait for
 what is now so small and slow to
 open it again.
  
 As now, indeed, it opens it again, this
 scentless velvet,
 crumbler-of-the-rocks,
  
 this Lichen!

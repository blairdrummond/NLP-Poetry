title : Love Poem

author : Dorothea Lasky

text : 
The rain whistled.
  
 A taxi brought me to your apartment building
 And there I stood.
  
 I had dreamed a dream
 Of us in a bedroom.
 The light shining upon us in white sheets.
  
 You were singing me a song of your sailing days
 And in the dream
 I reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal
 Which in bright red
 Flew out the window.
  
 Sometimes when we talk 
 On the phone, I think to myself
 That the deep perfect of your soul
 Is what draws me to you.
 But still what soul is perfect?
 All souls are misshapen and off-colored.
 Morning comes within a soul
 And makes it obey another law
 In which all souls are snowflakes.
  
 Once at a funeral, a man had died
 And with the prayers said, his soul flew up in a hurry
 Like it had been let out of something awful.
 It was strangely colored, that soul.
 And it was a funny shape and a funny temperature.
 As it blew away, all of us looking felt the cold.

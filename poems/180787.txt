title : The Winter

author : Dafydd ap Gwilym

text : 
Across North Wales 
The snowflakes wander, 
A swarm of white bees. 
Over the woods 
A cold veil lies. 
A load of chalk   
Bows down the trees. 

No undergrowth 
Without its wool, 
No field unsheeted;   
No path is left 
Through any field; 
On every stump 
White flour is milled. 

Will someone tell me 
What angels lift   
Planks in the flour-loft 
Floor of heaven 
Shaking down dust? 
An angel’s cloak 
Is cold quicksilver. 

And here below 
The big drifts blow, 
Blow and billow 
Across the heather 
Like swollen bellies. 
The frozen foam 
Falls in fleeces. 

Out of my house 
I will not stir 
For any girl 
To have my coat 
Look like a miller’s   
Or stuck with feathers 
Of eider down. 

What a great fall 
Lies on my country! 
A wide wall, stretching 
One sea to the other,   
Greater and graver 
Than the sea’s graveyard. 
When will rain come?

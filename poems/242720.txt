title : Ice Men

author : James Longenbach

text : 
One cuts blocks
From the abundant river,
Hauls them house to house.
 
One falls, unseen,
The heart
Inoculated cold
 
Against a sky still moving.
Moving even now
Above the river,
The canal.
Willows shimmering
 
Across the water,
Muskrats diving out of reach.
The river whispers
Till it freezes—
 
A body
Twirling sluggishly
Beneath the surface as again
 
One stack, then
Spreads the straw.
 
Another falters,
Slips, or
Puts a sliver on your tongue
To feel it melting there—
The ice-lit
 
Underworld
Of someone else.

title : sorrows

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
who would believe them winged 
who would believe they could be 

beautiful         who would believe 
they could fall so in love with mortals 

that they would attach themselves 
as scars attach and ride the skin 


sometimes we hear them in our dreams 
rattling their skulls         clicking their bony fingers 

envying our crackling hair 
our spice filled flesh 


they have heard me beseeching 
as I whispered into my own 

cupped hands       enough not me again 
enough       but who can distinguish 

one human voice   
amid such choruses of desire

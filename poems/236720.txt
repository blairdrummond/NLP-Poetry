title : The Solitude of Night

author : Li Po

text : 
It was at a wine party—
I lay in a drowse, knowing it not. 
The blown flowers fell and filled my lap. 
When I arose, still drunken, 
The birds had all gone to their nests, 
And there remained but few of my comrades. 
I went along the river—alone in the moonlight.

title : I Fail As a Celibate

author : Jerome Rothenberg

text : 
Despair leaves 
a dry spot 
the passage of light 
through my veins. 
I fail as a celibate. 
The smell of honey 
fills my throat. 
I lose touch with 
my bone when 
it stiffens. 
Sometimes 
I find a place 
to spring 
& spike you 
while you cry. 
I try to rev things up 
although I hate 
the sound of flying. 
Gagging leaves 
the breath 
no exit. 
Then the chest puffs out, 
no longer hapless, 
in the face of 
everything aloof 
& distant, 
where the world begins. 
I go on craving 
hostile to the ones like you 
who bind me. 
I surrender any 
knowledge of the cave 
in which I hide 
from light.

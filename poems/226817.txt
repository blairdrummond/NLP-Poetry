title : After Summer Fell Apart

I can’t touch you. 
His face always returns;   
we exchange long looks   
in each bad dream   
& what I see, my God.   
Honey, sweetheart,   
I hold you against me   
but nothing works.   
Two boats moored,   
rocking between nowhere 
& nowhere. 
A bone inside me whispers 
maybe tonight, 
but I keep thinking 
about the two men wrestling nude   
in Lawrence’s Women in Love. 
I can’t get past 
reels of breath unwinding. 
He has you. Now 
he doesn’t. He has you   
again. Now he doesn’t. 

You’re at the edge of azaleas   
shaken loose by a word.   
I see your rose-colored   
skirt unfurl. 
He has a knife 
to your throat, 
night birds come back   
to their branches. 
A hard wind raps at the door,   
the new year prowling   
in a black overcoat.   
It’s been six months   
since we made love.   
Tonight I look at you   
hugging the pillow,   
half smiling in your sleep.   
I want to shake you & ask   
who. Again I touch myself,   
unashamed, until 
his face comes into focus.   
He’s stolen something   
from me & I don’t know   
if it has a name or not— 
like counting your ribs   
with one foolish hand   
& mine with the other.

title : Believe It

author : John Logan

text : 
There is a two-headed goat, a four-winged chicken   
and a sad lamb with seven legs 
whose complicated little life was spent in Hopland,   
California. I saw the man with doubled eyes 
who seemed to watch in me my doubts about my spirit.   
Will it snag upon this aging flesh? 

There is a strawberry that grew 
out of a carrot plant, a blade 
of grass that lanced through a thick rock, 
a cornstalk nineteen-feet-two-inches tall grown by George   
Osborne of Silome, Arkansas. 
There is something grotesque growing in me I cannot tell. 

It has been waxing, burgeoning, for a long time. 
It weighs me down like the chains of the man of Lahore   
who began collecting links on his naked body 
until he crawled around the town carrying the last   
thirteen years of his life six-hundred-seventy pounds.   
Each link or each lump in me is an offense against love. 

I want my own lit candle lamp buried in my skull   
like the Lighthouse Man of Chungking, 
who could lead the travelers home. 
Well, I am still a traveler and I don’t know where   
I live. If my home is here, inside my breast, 
light it up! And I will invite you in as my first guest.

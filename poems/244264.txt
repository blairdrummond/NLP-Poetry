title : [We are the knife people . . .]

author : John Spaulding

text : 
We are the knife people, iron men, coat people
       and he-lands-sailing.
Souse eaters, house makers, husbands
       of kine and goat and swine, farm builders
       and keepers of kettle and scummer, word
       scratchers, corn stealers and bad sleepers.
 
As if towns could build themselves.
As if stumps jumped from the ground or
       flesh of beasts fell into trenchers.
As if paradise prevailed on earth.
To come to rich moulds and lush plantings,
       long-necked trees and tongues of land,
 
to redd the wild for the unborn.
       To reck not the peril.
Suffering snakes that may fly, wolves
       that may ravish. Kingdom
       of sachem and sagamore.
Kingdom of corn and thorny promise.
 
To satisfy our appetite of spirit,
       our thirst of property.
To seek not the opera of war but
       belittled by the possibilities
to stand silenced by the task before us—
 
 these be my sudden and undigested thoughts.

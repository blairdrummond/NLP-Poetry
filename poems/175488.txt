title : Carrie Leigh’s Hugh Hefner Haikus

author : Lynn Crosbie

text : 
Hef brings me flowers 
tiger lilies, ochre veined 
downcast, sleek black cups 

small shadows, are the 
puckers in his pyjamas 
where his skin caves in 

tired profligate, I 
sigh and pour the oil along 
your circular sheets 

thinking of all the 
times, or women on this bed 
glossy old bunnies 

I imagine their 
breasts, plate of fried eggs, a row 
of tonsured monks’ heads 

his tongue slithers, gaunt 
voluptuary, ugly 
old man, my eyes close 

when I roll his name 
Ner. along my tongue, like the 
line of cold test tubes 

thin bottled semen, 
he wants to plant it, deeply 
in my flat belly 

Hugh junior, and, or 
Carietta, a child is 
packed in dry blue ice 

in silk pyjamas 
they have an emperor’s crest 
it is dark in there 

but it’s cold as 
the green jacuzzi, bubbles 
are clouds on its face 

I will crush the glass 
with the fingers in his back 
and pile on my rings 

and all the fur coats 
and move down the circular 
stairs, bloated with gold 

the flowers are a 
venus-flytrap, with red curls 
flames and noxious breath 

his betrayal gives 
me granite fists, girls scatter 
movie stars crumple 

as I run away, 
from the gaudy prison cell, 
of tinsel and skin 

I’ll sue him and write 
and build a home, in the 
desert, on the sun 

a sequined empress, 
a mirage—in loungewear and 
harlequin glasses

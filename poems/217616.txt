title : A Book on a Shelf

author : Roger Mitchell

text : 
A history of some sort, one that made us, 
a war and what the war had meant, or since 
meaning eludes war, what it did to the look 
of the trees and the sides of the buildings, 
most of which survived, only to be torn down 
later to widen the street or put up a new 
office complex. There it was on the shelf. 
I was there only a moment, but still, 
I wanted to know what happened to the man 
in the photograph wearing a flat cap 
standing outside the important building 
cheering. He was there. He was part of that 
moment, one of the first into the streets 
when the turn of events came, the declaration 
or pronouncement, words that would change 
the look of everything he smiled on, words 
that may have cost him his life. Here it is 
in a book I found on a shelf. The person 
who lives here bought it at a library 
stock reduction sale. No one had read it. 
It looked interesting thirty years ago. 
It was practically new, the back uncracked. 
But the person did what those before her had, 
put it up on a shelf and never found 
a way back to it. The history sits there, 
unread, unbelievable, somebody else's. 
Even I have only looked at the pictures, 
at the man smiling between the cold pages. 
Maybe ending the world as he knew it 
was ok. Maybe it was the only way. 
Maybe the world has to come to an end 
in the first place to be the world. And the man? 
He has to smile, though he knows so little 
of what's coming, even looking right at it. 
As we do, who still haven't read the book.

title : Turtle

Who would be a turtle who could help it? 
A barely mobile hard roll, a four-oared helmet, 
she can ill afford the chances she must take 
in rowing toward the grasses that she eats. 
Her track is graceless, like dragging 
a packing-case places, and almost any slope 
defeats her modest hopes. Even being practical, 
she's often stuck up to the axle on her way 
to something edible. With everything optimal, 
she skirts the ditch which would convert 
her shell into a serving dish. She lives 
below luck-level, never imagining some lottery 
will change her load of pottery to wings. 
Her only levity is patience, 
the sport of truly chastened things.

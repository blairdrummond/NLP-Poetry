text : 
I woke. A tiny knot of skin on a silver table
 Set in the birth-theater, blinking in the glare
 Of electric lights and a strange arranged
  
 Passel of faces: huge as gods in their council.
 I was the actor who forgets his lines and enters
 On stage suddenly wanting to say, I am.
  
 I was almost all eye: they weighed me down,
 Two lump-big brown-sugar bags in a face
 Which did not yet know struggle, burden;
  
 How the look of newborns unnerves. Then
 They wrapped me in pale yellow like a new sun
 Still too small to throw up into the sky.
  
  
               It was midnight when they injected me
 With a plague; tamed, faded as imperialism, pox
 Had once put its palm-leaf hand over a quarter of Earth
  
 Saying, these. Now it was contracted to a drop:
 And in the morning I knew both death and life.
 Lapped in my nimbus of old gold light, my 
  
 Huge lashes drooped over my deepened eyes, like
 Ostrich-feather shades over twin crown princes: wet heads
 Sleek and doomed as the black soul of an open poppy.

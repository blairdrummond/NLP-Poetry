Blank Verse

Oh, but to fade, and live we know not where, 
To be a cold obstruction and to groan! 
This sensible, warm woman to become 
A prudish clod; and the delighted spirit 
To live and die alone, or to reside 
With married sisters, and to have the care 
Of half a dozen children, not your own; 
And driven, for no one wants you, 
Round the pendant world; or worse than worse 
Of those that disappointment and pure spite 
Have driven to madness: 'Tis too horrible! 
The weariest and most troubled married life 
That age, ache, penury, or jealousy 
Can lay on nature, is a paradise 
To being an old maid. 



That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not,) 
Walking between the garden and the barn, 
Reuben, all armed; a certain aim he took 
At a young chicken standing by a post, 
And loosed his bullet smartly from his gun, 
As he would kill a hundred thousand hens. 
But I might see young Reuben's fiery shot 
Lodged in the chaste board of the garden fence, 
And the domesticated fowl passed on, 
In henly meditation, bullet free. 



My father had a daughter got a man, 
As it might be, perhaps, were I good-looking, 
I should, your lordship. 
And what's her residence? 
A hut my lord, she never owned a house, 
But let her husband, like a graceless scamp, 
Spend all her little means,--she thought she ought,-- 
And in a wretched chamber, on an alley, 
She worked like masons on a monument, 
Earning their bread. Was not this love indeed?

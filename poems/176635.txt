title : A Yellow Leaf

author : Alberto Ríos

text : 
A yellow leaf in the branches 
Of a shamel ash 
In the front yard; 
I see it, a yellow leaf 
Among so many. 
Nothing distinguishes it, 
Nothing striking, striped, stripped, 
Strident, nothing 
More than its yellow 
On this day, 
Which is enough, which makes me 
Think of it later in the day, 
Remember it in conversation 
With a friend, 
Though I do not mention it— 
A yellow leaf on a shamel ash 
On a clear day 
In an Arizona winter, 
A January like so many.

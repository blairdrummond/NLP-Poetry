Rhymed Stanza

Who would true Valour see 
Let him come hither;   
One here will Constant be,   
Come Wind, come Weather.   
There's no Discouragement, 
Shall make him once Relent, 
His first avow'd Intent, 
To be a Pilgrim. 

Who so beset him round, 
With dismal Storys, 
Do but themselves Confound;   
His Strength the more is. 
No Lyon can him fright, 
He'l with a Gyant Fight, 
But he will have a right,  
To be a Pilgrim. 

Hobgoblin,  nor foul Fiend, 
Can daunt his Spirit:  
He knows, he at the end, 
Shall Life Inherit. 
Then Fancies fly away,   
He'l fear not what men say,   
He'l labour Night and Day,  
To be a Pilgrim.

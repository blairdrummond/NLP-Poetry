a young girl 
is somewhere waiting on 
the boy she loves; she 
has seen him every day for the last 
five years but today he will not come.

an old man 
is down by a river 
standing at the spot 
where he saw his only son drown.

a woman who never knew her 
mother but knew her 
mother did not love her 
is somewhere walking the 
streets.

i travel to all these places, 
long to capture that 
which seems to be our shadow,
swells with absurdity 
recalls jobs we can’t have, 
hotels we can’t enter 
restaurants which show us doors 
instead of menus.

ours is a deep dyed emotion; 
marching bands 
ragtimers 
banjo pickers 
barrelhouse ballers 
dangerous dance halls 
segregated neighborhoods 
too proud to weep what it lives.

we are that drama. 
we are this 
unusual arrangement 
that speaks for the millions,
that is why this song is 
full of our dreams

heard in 
late hours on our radios 
phonographs 
we love ourselves more 
sleep well at night 
rise from our beds 
to work hard 
and fancy future 
triumphs where 
we are wide awake 
in the middle 
of nightmare,

this sound will 
carry us forward 
and speak to the world 
in a language that does 
not lie

just a ditty i wrote down 
one day 
before the show 
while my 
mother prepared supper,

and somewhere 
we were living 
this mood . . .

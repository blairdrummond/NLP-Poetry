title : continental divide

had no direction to go but up: and this, the shattery road 
its surface graining, trickle in late thaw—is nothing amiss? 
            —this melt, the sign assures us, natural cycle 
                         and whoosh, the water a dream of forgotten white 

past aspens colored in sulfur, they trembled, would 
—poor sinners in redemption song—shed their tainted leaves 



I tell you what boy I was, writing lyrics to reflect my passions: 
the smell of a bare neck in summer 
a thin trail of hairs disappearing below the top button of cut-offs 
the lean, arched back of a cyclist straining to ascend a hill 

in the starlight I wandered: streets no better than fields 
the cul-de-sacs of suburbia just as treacherous, just as empty 

if wood doves sang in the branches of the acacias, I could not hear them 
anyone lost in that same night was lost in another tract 

the air pulsed and dandelion pollen blew from green stalks 
                        —that was all 



and yes, someone took me in his car.   and another against the low fence 
in the park at the end of our block.   under the willow branches 
where gnats made a furious cloud at dawn and chased us away 

I knew how it felt to lie in a patch of marigolds: golden stains 
the way morning swarmed a hidden rooftop, the catbirds singing 
the feel of ruin upon lips rubbed raw throughout the night 

granite peaks: here, the earth has asserted itself. and the ice asserted 
and human intimacies conspired to keep us low and apart 

for an ice age I knew you only as an idea of longing: 
a voice in the next yard, whispering through the chink 
a vagabond outlined against the sky, among the drying grass 



we journey this day to darkness: the chasm walls lift us on their scaly backs 
the glaciers relinquish their secrets: that sound is the ice bowing 
and the sound underneath, the trickle: the past released, disappearing 



you pinnacle of my life, stand with me on this brink 
half-clouded basin caked in flat grays, the very demise of green 

you have surmounted the craggy boundary between us. 



you open a place for me in earth, receiving my song 


                                 —for Haines Eason

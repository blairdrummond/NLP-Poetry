title : Philosophia Perennis

author : Anne Waldman

text : 
I turned: quivering yellow stars in blackness   
I wept: how speech may save a woman 
The picture changes & promises the heroine   
That nighttime & meditation are a mirage 

To discuss pro & contra here is mute 
Do I not love you, day? 
A pure output of teleological intentions 
& she babbles, developing a picture-theory of language 

Do I not play the delicate game of language?   
yes, & it is antecedent to the affairs of the world:   
The dish, the mop, the stove, the bed, the marriage   
& surges forth the world in which I love 

I and I and I and I and I and I, infinitely reversible   
Yet never secure in the long morning texture 
A poor existing woman-being, accept her broken heart   
& yet the earth is divinity, the sky is divinity 
The nomads walk & walk.

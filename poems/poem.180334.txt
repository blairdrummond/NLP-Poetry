Rhymed Stanza, Persona

Quis consurget mecum adversus malignantes? aut quis stabit mecum adversus operantes iniquitatem? Nemo, Domine!
What can it avail 
To drive forth a snail, 
Or to make a sail 
Of an herring's tail; 
To rhyme or to rail, 
To write or to indict, 
Either for delight 
Or else for despight; 
Or books to compile 
Of divers manner of style, 
Vice to revile 
And sin to exile; 
To teach or to preach, 
As reason will reach? 
Say this, and say that, 
His head is so fat, 
He wotteth never what 
Nor whereof he speaketh; 
He crieth and he creaketh, 
He prieth and he peeketh, 
He chides and he chatters, 
He prates and he patters,   
He clitters and he clatters, 
He meddles and he smatters, 
He gloses and he flatters; 
Or if he speak plain, 
Then he lacketh brain, 
He is but a fool; 
Let him go to school, 
On a three footed stool 
That he may down sit, 
For he lacketh wit; 
And if that he hit 
The nail on the head, 
It standeth in no stead; 
The devil, they say, is dead, 
The devil is dead. 
    It may well so be, 
Or else they would see 
Otherwise, and flee 
From worldly vanity, 
And foul covetousness, 
And other wretchedness, 
Fickle falseness, 
Variableness, 
With unstableness. 
    And if ye stand in doubt 
Who brought this rhyme about, 
My name is Colin Clout. 
I purpose to shake out 
All my connying bag, 
Like a clerkly hag; 
For though my rhyme be ragged, 
Tattered and jagged, 
Rudely rain beaten, 
Rusty and moth eaten, 
If ye take well therewith, 
It hath in it some pith.

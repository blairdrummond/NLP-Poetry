Here, 
    With my beer 
I sit, 
While golden moments flit: 
    Alas! 
    They pass 
Unheeded by: 
And, as they fly, 
I, 
Being dry, 
    Sit, idly sipping here 
    My beer. 

O, finer far 
Than fame, or riches, are 
The graceful smoke-wreaths of this free cigar! 
    Why 
    Should I 
    Weep, wail, or sigh? 
    What if luck has passed me by? 
What if my hopes are dead,--  
My pleasures fled? 
    Have I not still 
    My fill 
Of right good cheer,-- 
Cigars and beer? 

    Go, whining youth, 
    Forsooth! 
Go, weep and wail, 
Sigh and grow pale, 
    Weave melancholy rhymes 
    On the old times, 
Whose joys like shadowy ghosts appear,--
But leave me to my beer! 
    Gold is dross,-- 
    Love is loss,--
So, if I gulp my sorrows down, 
Or see them drown 
In foamy draughts of old nut-brown, 
Then do I wear the crown, 
    Without the cross!

Free Verse

When I go away from you 
The world beats dead 
Like a slackened drum. 
I call out for you against the jutted stars   
And shout into the ridges of the wind.   
Streets coming fast, 
One after the other, 
Wedge you away from me, 
And the lamps of the city prick my eyes 
So that I can no longer see your face. 
Why should I leave you, 
To wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night?

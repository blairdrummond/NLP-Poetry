title : A Practice Known as Churning

author : Alli Warren

text : 
I went to the city some days 
to learn my master's pleasure 
& laid fort at the farthest place 
where hedges are highest 
& terror of the obvious 
is a rosary of similitude

Did you see some of the nudging? 
How did you feel about the nudging?

Boats by water and wagons by land 
in active assistance in perpetuating 
fraudulent froth & hence 
with haste I've seen 
their mulchy tongues 
suck up every animate aim 
sweeping excess into piles

the reserves and neocons 
administrators and representatives

the preachers and deputies 
and yahoos and spodies 
In the evenings they come down 
from their operational sectors 
to kiss the children

what terror is in them 
to keep the sugar boiling 
to restrain the wanderings 
as fragile and fictitious

Did you see the tent on a stick?
Did you see the architecture of gathering?

I go to the city some days 
to gather what's left of scrubgrass 
There in the alley we converse 
Idris his love of fresh skim 
Ted his disdain for women 
their lack of banking 
Terrence and Will their concern 
for purity of pussy

power precedes them 
sap-drenched 
& parceled 
across the land

I go to the city some days I receive a letter
Dear Comrades
don't get it twisted
never lick the hand that lashes you
use beef when you run out of oakum

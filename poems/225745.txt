title : Hanging Fire

author : Audre Lorde

text : 
I am fourteen 
and my skin has betrayed me   
the boy I cannot live without   
still sucks his thumb 
in secret 
how come my knees are 
always so ashy 
what if I die 
before morning 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed. 

I have to learn how to dance   
in time for the next party   
my room is too small for me   
suppose I die before graduation   
they will sing sad melodies   
but finally 
tell the truth about me 
There is nothing I want to do   
and too much 
that has to be done 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed. 

Nobody even stops to think   
about my side of it 
I should have been on Math Team   
my marks were better than his   
why do I have to be 
the one 
wearing braces 
I have nothing to wear tomorrow   
will I live long enough 
to grow up 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed.

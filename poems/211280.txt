title : Chanson Philosophique

author : Timothy Steele

text : 
The nominalist in me invents 
A life devoid of precedents.
The realist takes a different view: 
He claims that all I feel and do 
Billions of others felt and did 
In history’s Pre-me period.

Arguing thus, both voices speak 
A partial truth. I am unique, 
Yet the unceasing self-distress 
Of desire buffets me no less 
Than it has other sons of man
Who’ve come and gone since time began.

The meaning, then, of this dispute? 
My life’s a nominal/real pursuit,
Which leaves identity clear and blurred, 
In which what happens has occurred 
Often and never—which is to say, 
Never to me, or quite this way.

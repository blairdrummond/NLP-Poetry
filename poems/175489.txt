title : Love Letters

author : Lynn Crosbie

text : 
I would give my husband drawings for grocery lists, 
with smiling faces on the eggs, and spider feet 
dangling everywhere. I could draw letters too. 
fat senseless alphabets, lexical landscapes of 
pointed trees and bloated clouds. that is how I 
wished words were, with changing colours and 
feathers in their spines. on road signs in my 
dreams, they shimmied, their Rockette heels a 
variegated sunburst. unlike the stiff black 
knots and stakes that glared at me from envelopes 
and books. an unchanging and cruel exotica, 
like smelling Cuban cigars wherever you go or 
the same screaming opera. he said that I did 
not need to learn with him there, reading slowly 
aloud, but sometimes in silence. that drove me 
insane, he would laugh or frown at something 
on the page, and look as if he were a creeping 
vine on a tombstone, a coffee stain on a piece 
of clean manilla. I practice learning on a stack 
of mail he kept in his sock drawer, and I 
finally learned dear. Dear Hank, it felt like 
having a perfume sample fall from a magazine 
in a sweet sudden breath. it made me think of 
velvet antlers, of his rumpled cardigan sweater 
and my love for him, a word which slayed me, 
with its clean lines and quick exhalation, 
the swelling heart in its middle. I began to 
scream things all day long, and I felt the first 
affection for poetry through the ringing sounds 
of advertisements, soapbox labels and advice to 
the lovelorn columns. words were heroic, huge 
killing things, and they beat in my head and 
bled from my eyes and fingers. I would be ironing, 
and a giant phrase or comma would barrel into 
the room, its veins bulging, its arms around 
my waist. Dear Hank, I miss you especially 
your sexy hands, mine clenched when I got that 
far and then some. then I knew for sure that 
reading was magic, it conjured up these long 
eyelashes and white Harlow hair, and the guilty 
baldspot and shaking dewlap of my faithless 
husband, adrift on the libretto of his private 
life. he would still read to me in his annoying 
way while I squirmed on my novels and texts, 
that lay under the couch cushions like misplaced 
scissors. I drew him an elaborate list one day, 
of pink champagne bottles and support girdles, 
and wrote my first words. I left them with his 
letters, on the back of our marriage certificate, 
I think they were my finest, I said, Dear 
Hank, the end. and right away began working on 
a longer book.

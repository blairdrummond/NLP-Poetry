title : Old Man Throwing a Ball

author : David Baker

text : 
He is tight at first, stiff, stands there atilt 
tossing the green fluff tennis ball down 
the side alley, but soon he’s limber, 
he’s letting it fly and the black lab 
 
lops back each time. These are the true lovers, 
this dog, this man, and when the dog stops 
to pee, the old guy hurries him back, then 
hurls the ball farther away.  Now his mother 
 
dodders out, she’s old as the sky, wheeling 
her green tank with its sweet vein, breath. 
She tips down the path he’s made for her, 
grass rippling but trim, soft underfoot, 
 
to survey the yard, every inch of it 
in fine blossom, set-stone, pruned miniature, 
split rails docked along the front walk, 
antique watering cans down-spread—up 
 
huffs the dog again with his mouthy ball— 
so flowers seem to spill out, red geraniums, 
grand blue asters, and something I have 
no name for, wild elsewhere in our world 
 
but here a thing to tend. To call for, and it comes.

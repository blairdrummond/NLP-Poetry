Couplet

The porter in the Pullman car 
Was charming, as they sometimes are. 
He scanned my baggage tags: "Are you 
The man who wrote of Lady Lou?" 
When I said "yes" he made a fuss -- 
Oh, he was most assiduous; 
And I was pleased to think that he 
Enjoyed my brand of poetry. 

He was forever at my call, 
So when we got to Montreal 
And he had brushed me off, I said: 
"I'm glad my poems you have read, 
I feel quite flattered, I confess, 
And if you give me your address 
I'll send you (autographed, of course) 
One of my little books of verse." 

He smiled -- his teeth were white as milk; 
He spoke -- his voice was soft as silk. 
I recognized, despite his skin, 
The perfect gentleman within. 
Then courteously he made reply: 
"I thank you kindly, Sir, but I 
With many other cherished tome 
Have all your books of verse at home. 

"When I was quite a little boy 
I used to savour them with joy; 
And now my daughter, aged three, 
Can tell the tale of Sam McGee; 
While Tom, my son, that's only two, 
Has heard the yarn of Dan McGrew .... 
Don't think your stuff I'm not applaudin' -- 
My taste is Eliot and Auden." 

So as we gravely bade adieu 
I felt quite snubbed -- and so would you. 
And yet I shook him by the hand, 
Impressed that he could understand 
The works of those two tops I mention, 
So far beyond my comprehension -- 
A humble bard of boys and barmen, 
Disdained, alas! by Pullman carmen.

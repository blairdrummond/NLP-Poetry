title : Approaches to How They Behave

 What does it matter if the words
 I choose, in the order I choose them in,
 Go out into a silence I know
 Nothing about, there to be let
 In and entertained and charmed
 Out of their master’s orders? And yet
 I would like to see where they go
 And how without me they behave.

 Speaking is difficult and one tries
 To be exact and yet not to
 Exact the prime intention to death.
 On the other hand the appearance of things
 Must not be made to mean another
 Thing. It is a kind of triumph
 To see them and to put them down
 As what they are. The inadequacy
 Of the living, animal language drives
 Us all to metaphor and an attempt
 To organize the spaces we think
 We have made occur between the words.

 The bad word and the bad word and
 The word which glamours me with some
 Quick face it pulls to make me let
 It leave me to go across
 In roughly your direction, hates
 To go out maybe so completely
 On another silence not its own.

 Before I know it they are out
 Afloat in the head which freezes them.
 Then I suppose I take the best
 Away and leave the others arranged
 Like floating bergs to sink a convoy.

 One word says to its mate O
 I do not think we go together
 Are we doing any good here
 Why do we find ourselves put down?
 The mate pleased to be spoken to
 Looks up from the line below
 And says well that doubtful god
 Who has us here is far from sure
 How we on our own tickle the chin
 Of the prince or the dame that lets us in.

 The dark companion is a star
 Very present like a dark poem
 Far and unreadable just out
 At the edge of this poem floating.
 It is not more or less a dark 
 Companion poem to the poem.

 Language is expensive if
 We want to strut, busked out
 Showing our best on silence.
 Good Morning. That is a bonny doing
 Of verbs you wear with the celandine
 Catching the same sun as mine.
 You wear your dress like a prince but
 A country’s prince beyond my ken.
 Through the chinks in your lyric coat
 My ear catches a royal glimpse
 Of fuzzed flesh, unworded body.
 Was there something you wanted to say?
 I myself dress up in what I can
 Afford on the broadway. Underneath
 My overcoat of the time’s slang
 I am fashionable enough wearing
 The grave-clothes of my generous masters.

 And what are you supposed to say
 I asked a new word but it kept mum.
 I had secretly admired always
 What I thought it was here for.
 But I was wrong when I looked it up
 Between the painted boards. It said
 Something it was never very likely
 I could fit in to a poem in my life.

 The good word said I am not pressed
 For time. I have all the foxglove day
 And all my user’s days to give
 You my attention. Shines the red
 Fox in the digitalis grove.
 Choose me choose me. Guess which
 Word I am here calling myself 
 The best. If you can’t fit me in
 To lying down here among the fox
 Glove towers of the moment, say
 I am yours the more you use me. Tomorrow
 Same place same time give me a ring.

 Backwards the poem’s just as good.
 We human angels as we read
 Read back as we gobble the words up.
 Allowing the poem to represent
 A recognizable landscape
 Sprouting green up or letting green
 With all its weight of love hang
 To gravity’s sweet affection,
 Arse-versa it is the same object,
 Even although the last word seems
 To have sung first, or the breakfast lark
 Sings up from the bottom of the sea.

 The poem is not a string of knots
 Tied for a meaning of another time
 And county, unreadable, found
 By chance. The poem is not a henge
 Or Easter Island emerged Longnose
 Or a tally used by early unknown
 Peoples. The words we breathe and puff
 Are our utensils down the dream
 Into the manhole. Replace the cover.

 
 12
  
 The words are mine. The thoughts are all
 Yours as they occur behind
 The bat of your vast unseen eyes.
 These words are as you see them put
 Down on the dead-still page. They have
 No ability above their station.
 Their station on silence is exact.
 What you do with them is nobody’s business.

Running across the language lightly
This morning in the hangingover
Whistling light from the window, I
Was tripped and caught into the whole
Formal scheme which Art is.
I had only meant to enjoy
Dallying between the imaginary
And imaginary’s opposite
With a thought or two up my sleeve.
 
 
14
 
Is the word? Yes Yes. But I hear
A sound without words from another
Person I can’t see at my elbow.
A sigh to be proud of. You? Me?
 
 
15
 
Having to construct the silence first
To speak out on I realize
The silence even itself floats
At my ear-side with a character
I have not met before. Hello
Hello I shout but that silence
Floats steady, will not be marked
By an off-hand shout. For some reason
It refuses to be broken now
By what I thought was worth saying.
If I wait a while, if I look out
At the heavy greedy rooks on the wall
It will disperse. Now I construct
A new silence I hope to break.

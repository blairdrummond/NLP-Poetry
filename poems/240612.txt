title : Perpetually Attempting to Soar

author : Mary Ruefle

A boy from Brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights.
 As soon as he’d hit sixty he’d hold his hand out the window,
 cupping it around the wind. He’d been assured
 this is exactly how a woman’s breast feels when you put
 your hand around it and apply a little pressure. Now he knew,
 and he loved it. Night after night, again and again, until
 the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up.
 For many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting 
 to soar. One winter’s night, holding his wife’s breast
 in his hand, he closed his eyes and wanted to weep.
 He loved her, but it was the wind he imagined now.
 As he grew older, he loved the word etcetera and refused
 to abbreviate it. He loved sweet white butter. He often
 pretended to be playing the organ. On one of his last mornings,
 he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow.
 He shook it out, but the next morning it reappeared.

I 
The angels guide him now, 
And watch his curly head, 
And lead him in their games, 
The little boy we led. 

    II 
He cannot come to harm, 
He knows more than we know, 
His light is brighter far 
Than daytime here below. 

    III 
His path leads on and on, 
Through pleasant lawns and flowers, 
His brown eyes open wide 
At grass more green than ours. 

    IV 
With playmates like himself, 
The shining boy will sing, 
Exploring wondrous woods, 
Sweet with eternal spring. 

    V 
Yet, he is lost to us, 
Far is his path of gold, 
Far does the city seem, 
Lonely our hearts and old.

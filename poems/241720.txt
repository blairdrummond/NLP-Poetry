title : Gracious Living          ‘Tara’ ﻿

author : Tom Raworth

text : 
lonely as four cherries on a tree
 at night, new moon, wet roads
 a moth or a snowflake
 whipping past glass
  
 lonely as the red noses of four clowns
 thrust up through snow
 their shine four whitened panes
 drawn from imagined memory
  
 lonely as no other lives
 touching to recorded water
 all objects stare
 their memories aware
  
 lonely as pain
 recoiling from itself
 imagining the cherries
 and roses reaching out

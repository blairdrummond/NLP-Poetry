My mother does not trust
women without it.
What are they not hiding? 
Renders the dead living

and the living more alive.
Everything I say sets 
the clouds off blubbering
like they knew the pretty dead.

True, no mascara, no evidence. 
Blue sky, blank face. Blank face,
a faithful liar, false bottom. 
Sorrow, a rabbit harbored in the head.

The skin, a silly one-act, concurs.
At the carnival, each child's cheek becomes
a rainbow. God, grant me a brighter myself.
Each breath, a game called Live Forever. 

I am small. Don't ask me to reconcile
one shadow with another. I admitâ€”
paint the dead pink, it does not make 
them sunrise. Paint the living blue, 

it does not make them sky, or sea, 
a berry, clapboard house, or dead. 
God, leave us our costumes, 
don't blow in our noses, 

strip us to the underside of skin.
Even the earth claims color
once a year, dressed in red leaves
as the trees play Grieving.

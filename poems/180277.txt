title : In the North

author : Devin Johnston

text : 
A blast off the Atlantic 
snaps a flag in the Firth 
of Clyde, while thirty leagues 
away, the same synoptic wind   
surges across this hillside   
honeycombed with mineshafts,   
sounding the unstopped slots   
of a "G" harmonica left   
to dry on the kitchen sill. 
Snow charges a sky 
in which the sun swims 
and glimmers like a groat, 
a turbulent space where owls 
hunt by day but nothing 
stands for long—bereft 
of circumstance—beyond 
the standing stones of   
Long Meg and Her Daughters. 

Through the night, like a stoker 
on a fast express—the Hyperion 
on its Edinburgh run— 
you hoy buckets of coal 
on the grate, only to see 
its flames drawn up 
the chimney, getting more   
heat from hoying the fuel   
than from its burning.   
As a barnacle goose swims 
against the dark, uttering 
its terse honk, you pull 
your favorite word, duvet, 
close about your head. 
Tomorrow, bailiffs may 
take everything   
not hammered down.

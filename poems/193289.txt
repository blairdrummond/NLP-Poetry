                                  I

To dream of love, and, waking, to remember you:
As though, being dead, one dreamed of heaven, and woke
      in hell.
At night my lovely dreams forget the old farewell:
Ah! wake not by his side, lest you remember too!



                                  II

I set all Rome between us: with what joy I set
The wonder of the world against my world's delight!
Rome, that hast conquered worlds, with intellectual might
Capture my heart, and teach my memory to forget!

title : Please Refrain from Talking During the Movie

author : Robert Polito

When I can’t make you understand I repeat myself
 I repeat
  
 If you don’t stop asking me all these questions how
 Will I understand anything
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 I need a life that isn’t just about needing
 To escape my life
  
 Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
  
 I want to show off my hidden camera
 I’m an informer but I have my limits
  
 You hurt him once before now what
 If she’s there I don’t know if I can go
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 Leave a message if you can’t reach me
 To exit press enter and don’t forget your receipt
  
 When I think I read new things I want
 A life where I read and think new things
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 I want to know nothing
 Again
  
 Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
  
 I repeat myself when I can’t
 Make you understand I repeat

Sonnet

You say, Columbus with his argosies 
Who rash and greedy took the screaming main 
And vanished out before the hurricane 
Into the sunset after merchandise, 
Then under western palms with simple eyes 
Trafficked and robbed and triumphed home again: 
You say this is the glory of the brain 
And human life no other use than this? 
I then do answering say to you: The line 
Of wizards and of saviours, keeping trust 
In that which made them pensive and divine, 
Passes before us like a cloud of dust. 
What were they? Actors, ill and mad with wine, 
And all their language babble and disgust.

text : 
Lepisosteus osseus
Despite it all, something stirs at the sight 
Of the cool, enameled body, 
The unreflecting eye, 
And the long jaw like a chisel 
With its single, violent purpose. 

It hangs dead still at the water's surface 
And seems lifeless, until 
A flickering gesture 
Carves fish after fish 
From any school that swims too close 

And creates in the world a new absence, 
As if this might be the shaper 
As well as the defacer 
Of the damaged masterpiece 
Whose headless body hails the bodies 

Of the many Egyptians excised at Cyprus.

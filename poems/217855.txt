title : Sharks' Teeth

author : Kay Ryan

text : 
Everything contains some   
silence. Noise gets 
its zest from the 
small shark's-tooth 
shaped fragments 
of rest angled 
in it. An hour   
of city holds maybe   
a minute of these   
remnants of a time   
when silence reigned,   
compact and dangerous   
as a shark. Sometimes   
a bit of a tail   
or fin can still   
be sensed in parks.

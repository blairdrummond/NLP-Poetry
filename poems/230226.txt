title : Inside Out

author : Diane Wakoski

text : 
I walk the purple carpet into your eye 
carrying the silver butter server 
but a truck rumbles by, 
                      leaving its black tire prints on my foot 
and old images          the sound of banging screen doors on hot   
             afternoons and a fly buzzing over the Kool-Aid spilled on   
             the sink 
flicker, as reflections on the metal surface. 

Come in, you said, 
inside your paintings, inside the blood factory, inside the   
old songs that line your hands, inside 
eyes that change like a snowflake every second, 
inside spinach leaves holding that one piece of gravel, 
inside the whiskers of a cat, 
inside your old hat, and most of all inside your mouth where you   
grind the pigments with your teeth, painting 
with a broken bottle on the floor, and painting 
with an ostrich feather on the moon that rolls out of my mouth. 

You cannot let me walk inside you too long inside   
the veins where my small feet touch 
bottom. 
You must reach inside and pull me 
like a silver bullet 
from your arm.

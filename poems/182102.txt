title : Tide of Voices

author : Lynda Hull

text : 
At the hour the streetlights come on, buildings 
turn abstract. The Hudson, for a moment, formal.   
We drink bourbon on the terrace and you speak 
in the evening voice, weighted deep in the throat. 

They plan to harvest oysters, you tell me, 
from the harbor by Jersey City, how the waters 
will be clean again in twenty years. I imagine nets 
burdened with rough shells, the meat dun and sexual. 

Below, the river and the high rock 
where boys each year jump from bravado 
or desperation. The day flares, turns into itself. 
And innocently, sideways, the way we always fall 

into grace or knowledge, we watched the police 
drag the river for a suicide, the third this year.   
The terrible hook, the boy’s frail whiteness. 
His face was blank and new as your face 

in the morning before the day has worked 
its pattern of lines and tensions. A hook 
like an iron question and this coming 
out of the waters, a flawed pearl— 

a memory that wasn’t ours to claim.   
Perhaps, in a bedroom by lamplight,   
a woman waits for this boy. She may riffle drawers 
gathering photographs, string, keys to abandoned rooms. 

Even now she may be leaving,   
closing the door for some silence. I need 
to move next to you. Water sluiced 
from the boy’s hair. I need to watch you 

light your cigarette, the flickering 
of your face in matchlight, as if underwater, 
drifting away. I take your cigarette 
and drag from it, touch your hand. 

Remember that winter of your long fever,   
the winter we understood how fragile 
any being together was. The wall sweated   
behind the headboard and you said you felt 

the rim where dreams crouch 
and every room of the past. It must begin in luxury— 
do you think—a break and fall into the glamour 
attending each kind of surrender. Water must flood 

the mind, as in certain diseases, the walls 
between the cells of memory dissolve, blur 
into a single stream of voices and faces.   
I don’t know any more about this river or if 

it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories— 
a tide of voices. And this is how the dead 
rise to us, transformed: wet and singing,   
the tide of voices pearling in our hands.

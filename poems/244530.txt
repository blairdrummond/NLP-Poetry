text : 
But it is not our wish to reproduce
              ourselves through you 
                            the reader,
 nor to reassure you that these words are true
 or where the line breaks           there is a meaning
 stabilized           by that news
 speech is                        assuring you
 our plans are still the same
 as when we met original in formal theory
 by the fridge on the streetcar
                     beneath some baggage of your satisfactions.
    
    
 Over this our patience supports you
                 beneath the topical tuck
 which is basic
                             to a sand ruse for writing through
 these intervals between
                             our disagreeable achievements
 signed in the triplicate stage of the plainer style
 moved on
 (not much of it)             to where
 the shade from the ilex soaks
 the officer in charge
  
              by the octagon
  
                                                   in august
   
  
 more or less.

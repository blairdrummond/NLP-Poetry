Beauty, I’ve seen you 
pressed hard against the windowpane.   
But the ugliness was unsolved 
in the heart & mouth. 
I’ve seen the quick-draw artist 
crouch among the chrysanthemums.   
Do I need to say more? 

Everything isn’t ha-ha 
in this valley. The striptease   
on stage at the Blue Movie   
is your sweet little Sara Lee.   
An argument of eyes 
cut through the metaphor,   
& I hear someone crying   
among crystal trees & confetti. 

The sack of bones in the magnolia,   
What’s more true than that?   
Before you can see 
her long pretty legs, 
look into her unlit eyes.   
A song of B-flat breath   
staggers on death row. Real 
men, voices that limp 
behind the one-way glass wall.   
I’ve seen the legless beggar   
chopped down to his four wheels.

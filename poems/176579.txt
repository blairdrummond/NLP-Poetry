Piute Creek, August 1955
“O hell, what do mine eyes 
          with grief behold?” 
Working with an old 
Singlejack miner, who can sense 
The vein and cleavage 
In the very guts of rock, can 
Blast granite, build 
Switchbacks that last for years 
Under the beat of snow, thaw, mule-hooves.   
What use, Milton, a silly story 
Of our lost general parents, 
          eaters of fruit? 

The Indian, the chainsaw boy, 
And a string of six mules 
Came riding down to camp 
Hungry for tomatoes and green apples.   
Sleeping in saddle-blankets 
Under a bright night-sky 
Han River slantwise by morning.   
Jays squall 
Coffee boils 

In ten thousand years the Sierras 
Will be dry and dead, home of the scorpion.   
Ice-scratched slabs and bent trees. 
No paradise, no fall, 
Only the weathering land 
The wheeling sky, 
Man, with his Satan 
Scouring the chaos of the mind. 
Oh Hell! 

Fire down 
Too dark to read, miles from a road   
The bell-mare clangs in the meadow   
That packed dirt for a fill-in   
Scrambling through loose rocks   
On an old trail 
All of a summer’s day.

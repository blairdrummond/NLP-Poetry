title : The Painter

Sitting between the sea and the buildings 
He enjoyed painting the sea’s portrait. 
But just as children imagine a prayer 
Is merely silence, he expected his subject 
To rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush, 
Plaster its own portrait on the canvas. 

So there was never any paint on his canvas 
Until the people who lived in the buildings 
Put him to work: “Try using the brush 
As a means to an end. Select, for a portrait, 
Something less angry and large, and more subject 
To a painter’s moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer.” 

How could he explain to them his prayer 
That nature, not art, might usurp the canvas? 
He chose his wife for a new subject, 
Making her vast, like ruined buildings, 
As if, forgetting itself, the portrait 
Had expressed itself without a brush. 

Slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush 
In the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer: 
“My soul, when I paint this next portrait 
Let it be you who wrecks the canvas.” 
The news spread like wildfire through the buildings: 
He had gone back to the sea for his subject. 

Imagine a painter crucified by his subject! 
Too exhausted even to lift his brush, 
He provoked some artists leaning from the buildings 
To malicious mirth: “We haven’t a prayer 
Now, of putting ourselves on canvas, 
Or getting the sea to sit for a portrait!” 

Others declared it a self-portrait. 
Finally all indications of a subject 
Began to fade, leaving the canvas 
Perfectly white. He put down the brush. 
At once a howl, that was also a prayer, 
Arose from the overcrowded buildings. 

They tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings; 
And the sea devoured the canvas and the brush 
As though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.

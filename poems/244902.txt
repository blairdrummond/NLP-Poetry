We tell the story every year—
 how we peered from the windows, shades drawn—
 though nothing really happened,
 the charred grass now green again.
  
 We peered from the windows, shades drawn,
 at the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
 the charred grass still green. Then
 we darkened our rooms, lit the hurricane lamps.
  
 At the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
 a few men gathered, white as angels in their gowns.
 We darkened our rooms and lit hurricane lamps,
 the wicks trembling in their fonts of oil.
  
 It seemed the angels had gathered, white men in their gowns.
 When they were done, they left quietly. No one came.
 The wicks trembled all night in their fonts of oil;
 by morning the flames had all dimmed.
  
 When they were done, the men left quietly. No one came.
 Nothing really happened.
 By morning all the flames had dimmed.
 We tell the story every year.

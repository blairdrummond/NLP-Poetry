The trees are in their autumn beauty,   
The woodland paths are dry, 
Under the October twilight the water   
Mirrors a still sky; 
Upon the brimming water among the stones   
Are nine-and-fifty swans. 

The nineteenth autumn has come upon me   
Since I first made my count; 
I saw, before I had well finished, 
All suddenly mount 
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings   
Upon their clamorous wings. 

I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,   
And now my heart is sore. 
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,   
The first time on this shore, 
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,   
Trod with a lighter tread. 

Unwearied still, lover by lover, 
They paddle in the cold 
Companionable streams or climb the air;   
Their hearts have not grown old; 
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,   
Attend upon them still. 

But now they drift on the still water,   
Mysterious, beautiful;   
Among what rushes will they build, 
By what lake's edge or pool 
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day   
To find they have flown away?

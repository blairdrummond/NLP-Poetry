I hate the phrase “inner life.” My attic hurts,
 and I’d like to quit the committee
 for naming tornadoes. Do you remember
 how easy and sad it was to be young
 and defined by our bicycles? My first
 was yellow, and though it was no Black
 Phantom or Sting-Ray but merely a Varsity
 I loved the afternoon it was suddenly gone,
 chasing its apian flash through the neighborhoods
 with my father in vain. Like being a nuclear
 family in a television show totally unaffected
 by a distant war. Then we returned
 to the green living room to watch the No Names
 hold our Over the Hill Gang under
 the monotinted chromatic defeated Super
 Bowl waters. 1973, year of the Black Fly
 caught in my Jell-O. Year of the Suffrage Building
 on K Street NW where a few minor law firms
 mingle proudly with the Union of Butchers
 and Meat Cutters. A black hand
 already visits my father in sleep, moving
 up his spine to touch his amygdala. I will
 never know a single thing anyone feels,
 just how they say it, which is why I am standing
 here exactly, covered in shame and lightning,
 doing what I’m supposed to do.

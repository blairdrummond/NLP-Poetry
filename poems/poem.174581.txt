Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

WELL, what's the matter ? there's a face
      What ! has it cut a vein ?
And is it quite a shocking place ?
      Come, let us look again.

I see it bleeds, but never mind
      That tiny little drop ;
I don't believe you'll ever find
      That crying makes it stop.

'Tis sad indeed to cry at pain,
      For any but a baby ;
If that should chance to cut a vein,
      We should not wonder, may be.

But such a man as you should try
      To bear a little sorrow :
So run along, and wipe your eye,
      'Twill all be well to-morrow.

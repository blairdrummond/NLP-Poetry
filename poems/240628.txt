When the wind invades the treetops
 and the trees agree, shivering 
 take me, take me, when their
 stealthy perfume drifts down to waft
 among mortals, they come out in droves:
 the boy whose bouncing keys speak a language
 all their own, the novice who gets her tricks
 from magazine molls (their haughtiness, swirl
 of cleats), the gigolo with eyes lowered,
 the better to judge his prey, the woman
 whose hemlines rise as her age does,
 the bad girl whose only remaining option
 is to get worse: despite the string of cheats
 and lukewarm reactions, she still has
 the power to pound, the knack of 
 funneling her frustration into
 the arrogant click of a heel . . .
 at this armada of proud, unyielding soldiers
 I have cast ferocious stones, holding forth
 on barricaded gardens and souls’ communion
 until, heaving my bones from garret to gutter
 I took to the street and saw it, too, was worthy.
 Chasers out for a good time, flirters in
 for a life’s catch, strutters so skilled your
 lurid designs burn holes, kill the cold
 in the pavement, it does not matter
 what fever you feed, so long as
 you feed it freely; I hid my eyes
 but sickness is catching; lovers, permit me entrance.

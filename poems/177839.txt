The laws of science teach us a pound of gold weighs as   
much as a pound of flour though if dropped from any   
undetermined height in their natural state one would 
reach bottom and one would fly away 

Laws of motion tell us an inert object is more difficult to   
propel than an object heading in the wrong direction is to   
turn around. Motion being energy—inertia—apathy.   
Apathy equals hostility. Hostility—violence. Violence   
being energy is its own virtue. Laws of motion teach us 

Black people are no less confused because of our   
Blackness than we are diffused because of our 
powerlessness. Man we are told is the only animal who   
smiles with his lips. The eyes however are the mirror of 
the soul 

The problem with love is not what we feel but what we   
wish we felt when we began to feel we should feel 
something. Just as publicity is not production: seduction 
is not seductive 

If I could make a wish I’d wish for all the knowledge of all   
the world. Black may be beautiful Professor Micheau 
says but knowledge is power. Any desirable object is 
bought and sold—any neglected object declines in value.   
It is against man’s nature to be in either category 

If white defines Black and good defines evil then men 
define women or women scientifically speaking describe 
men. If sweet is the opposite of sour and heat the 
absence of cold then love is the contradiction of pain and 
beauty is in the eye of the beheld 

Sometimes I want to touch you and be touched in   
return. But you think I’m grabbing and I think you’re   
shirking and Mama always said to look out for men like   
you 

So I go to the streets with my lips painted red and my   
eyes carefully shielded to seduce the world my reluctant   
lover 

And you go to your men slapping fives feeling good   
posing as a man because you know as long as you sit   
very very still the laws of motion will be in effect

text : 
april breath 
of  boyish red 
the tongue crushes 
strawberry dreams 

                                  hack away wound 
                                  and wound the fountain 

and on the mouth 
perspiration white 
from someone's neck 

a little tooth   
has bit the finger 
of  the bride the 
                                  tabby yellow and sere 
                                  howls 

the red boy   
from the gable flies 
an animal hearkens 
in his white throat 
                                  his juice runs down 
                                  pigeon thighs 

a pale sweet spike 
still sticks 
in woman white 
lard 

an april breath 
of  boyish red

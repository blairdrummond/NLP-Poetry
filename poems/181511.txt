listen mother, he punched the air:   I am not your son dying 
the day fades and the starlings roost:   a body’s a husk a nest of goodbye 

his wrist colorless and soft was not a stick of chewing gum 
how tell?    well a plastic bracelet with his name for one.    & no mint 
his eyes distinguishable from oysters how?    only when pried open 

she at times felt the needle going in.    felt her own sides cave.    she rasped 
she twitched with a palsy:   tectonic plates grumbled under her feet 

soiled his sheets clogged the yellow BIOHAZARD bin:   later to be burned 
soot clouds billowed out over the city:   a stole.    a pillbox hat    [smart city] 
and wouldn’t the taxis stop now.    and wouldn’t a hush smother us all 

the vascular walls graffitied and scarred.    a clotted rend in the muscle 
wend through the avenues throttled t-cells.    processional staph & thrush   

the scourge the spike a stab a shending bile the grace the quenching 
mother who brought me here, muddler:   open the window.    let birds in

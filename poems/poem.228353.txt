Granny's come to our house, 
    And ho! my lawzy-daisy! 
All the childern round the place 
    Is ist a-runnin' crazy! 
Fetched a cake fer little Jake, 
    And fetched a pie fer Nanny, 
And fetched a pear fer all the pack 
    That runs to kiss their Granny! 

Lucy Ellen's in her lap, 
    And Wade and Silas Walker 
Both's a-ridin' on her foot, 
    And 'Pollos on the rocker; 
And Marthy's twins, from Aunt Marinn's, 
    And little Orphant Annie, 
All's a-eatin' gingerbread 
    And giggle-un at Granny! 

Tells us all the fairy tales 
    Ever thought er wundered-- 
And 'bundance o' other stories-- 
    Bet she knows a hunderd!-- 
Bob's the one fer "Whittington," 
    And "Golden Locks" fer Fanny! 
Hear 'em laugh and clap their hands, 
    Listenin' at Granny! 

"Jack the Giant-Killer" 's good; 
    And "Bean-Stalk" 's another!-- 
So's the one of "Cinderell'" 
    And her old godmother;-- 
That-un's best of all the rest-- 
    Bestest one of any,-- 
Where the mices scampers home 
    Like we runs to Granny! 

Granny's come to our house, 
    Ho! my lawzy-daisy! 
All the childern round the place 
    Is ist a-runnin' crazy! 
Fetched a cake fer little Jake, 
    And fetched a pie fer Nanny, 
And fetched a pear fer all the pack 
    That runs to kiss their Granny!

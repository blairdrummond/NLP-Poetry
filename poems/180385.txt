title : Oh, For a Bowl of Fat Canary

author : John Lyly

text : 
Oh, for a bowl of fat Canary, 
Rich Palermo, sparkling Sherry, 
Some nectar else, from Junoâ€™s dairy; 
Oh, these draughts would make us merry! 

Oh, for a wrench (I deal in faces, 
And in other daintier things); 
Tickled am I with her embraces, 
Fine dancing in such fairy rings. 

Oh, for a plump fat leg of mutton, 
Veal, lamb, capon, pig, and coney; 
None is happy but a glutton, 
None an ass but who wants money. 

Wines indeed and girls are good, 
But brave victuals feast the blood; 
For wenches, wine, and lusty cheer, 
Jove would leap down to surfeit here.

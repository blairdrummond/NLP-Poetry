title : Eighth Sky

author : Michael Palmer

text : 
It is scribbled along the body
Impossible even to say a word
 
An alphabet has been stored beneath the ground
It is a practice alphabet, work of the hand
 
Yet not, not marks inside a box
For example, this is a mirror box
 
Spinoza designed such a box
and called it the Eighth Sky
 
called it the Nevercadabra House
as a joke
 
Yet not, not so much a joke
not Notes for Electronic Harp
 
on a day free of sounds
(but I meant to write “clouds”)
 
At night these same boulevards fill with snow
Lancers and dancers pass a poisoned syringe,
 
as you wrote, writing of death in the snow,
Patroclus and a Pharoah on Rue Ravignan
 
It is scribbled across each body
Impossible even to name a word
 
Look, you would say, how the sky falls
at first gently, then not at all
 
Two chemicals within the firefly are the cause,
twin ships, twin nemeses
 
preparing to metamorphose
into an alphabet in stone

 Make it
 the place
 it was then,
  
 so full it split
 vision to live
 there in winter
  
 so late & wet
 abundance
 toppled toward
  
 awful—birds
 of paradise
 a profusion
  
 the ripe colors
 of anodized
 metal; in gutters
  
 umbrellas
 smashed
 like pigeons,
  
 bent ribs bright
 among black
 slack fluttering;
  
 camellias’
 pink imagoes
 dropping
  
 into water
 & rotting,
 sweet stink—
  
 & did not
 stop :
 the inundated
  
 eye, over-
 populous
 urban eye,
  
 the whole 
 place, to look
 at it, was
  
 a footprint
 in January :
 everywhere
  
 cloudy water
 rising to fill in
 the outlines,
  
 & meanwhile
 indoors differed
 by degree
  
 alone : without
 love, loosed
 from God,
  
 there were
 lovers & touch
 rushing in
  
 to redraw
 your boundaries
 constantly
  
 because
 it was a tune
 you kept
  
 getting wrong,
 the refrain
 of what it meant
  
 to live alone,
 months of that
 and then  
  
 .
  
 sudden summer, sheer release, streets all cigarettes & sashay,
    balls-out tube tops, low-riders & belly fat, the girls on the block
  
 all like Oh no she didn’t, and girl, she did, she was mad skills
    with press-ons & a cell phone telling him where to stick it, a kid
  
 on her hip, just like that, summer, sheer beauty & lip gloss
    that smelled like peaches, & you going to the store for whiskey
  
 & condoms like everyone else on a hot, long afternoon
    so long & hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it weren’t also
  
 a pleasure, thoughtless & shiftless & horny & drunk,
    just someone thinking summer wasn’t up to anything deep, & lo
  
 there he was, his punk ass pink as a Viking in a tight
    wifebeater & lingering by the public pool, drinking beer so sly
  
 it didn’t look illegal, & he wasn’t a good idea but
    did you have a light? & it seemed the whole summer went like that,
  
 taking fire out of your pocket & giving it away, a ditty
    you could whistle it was so cliché, like the numbers they gave you after
  
 & you never called, the number of swollen nodes of the kissing
    colds you got & later the number to call to get tested, the number of the bus
  
 to the clinic, the number they gave you when they asked
    you to wait, the number of questions asked, number of partners, number
  
 of risks, number of previous tests, the number of pricks
    —one—to draw the blood, the number of minutes you waited before
  
 results, & then you decided you had to get the tune right,
    the how to live it so it doesn’t kill you, to take a number & wait in the long line
  
of the city’s bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes
    no matter how long you wait, & the grocery bag breaking, & if you were going
  
 to sing that one, the one that sounds like all I got is bruised
    tomatoes, broken glass & dirty bread & no one waiting at home, would you

.
  
 start with genius,
 as in, the spirit
 of a place?,
  
 & small, as in
 of the back, wet 
 in heat
  
 & the urge
 to touch him
 there, skin
  
 just visible
 between his jeans
 & t-shirt,
  
 to see if
 he’s sweating,
 to see
  
 if he feels
 what you feel?,
 & if he does,
  
 is that all
 the spirit the place
 will give,
  
 a small thing
 shared, just
 a phrase, not
  
 a whole song,
 but something
 to build on?,
  
 & if it isn’t bread
 & if it sure
 ain’t tomatoes
  
 it isn’t empty,
 is it, like the signage
 you walk by
  
 that fronts
 the Lakeside
 Church of Practical
  
 Christianity,
 hawking
 a knowledge of God
  
 so modest
 it seems trivial?,
 & it isn’t ever,
  
 is it, the how
 to live it
 so it doesn’t
  
 kill you,
 the where
 to touch it,
  
 the when 
 will genius
 sing your name
  
 so it sounds
 like a place
 you can live?

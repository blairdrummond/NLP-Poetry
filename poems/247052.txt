title : Happy Trigger

author : Carmen Giménez Smith

text : 
Off-season and in 
the burnt forest 
of my nightgown, a feral 
undergrowth that marks 
me as burial site—
to be still enough or 
just enough.

My arms become fat arms: 
hearth. I eat dirt for doubt, 
a secret bleached 
old as lie. I out-want 
like a spindly 
winged monster.
If I were a bug—
were I—then you'd hope 
for reparation, and paint 
more brown into the plot.

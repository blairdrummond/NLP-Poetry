Blank Verse, Sonnet

Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;
 Thy lovely things must all be laid away;
 And thou, as others, must face the riven day
 Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,
 Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs
 The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,
 Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say
 Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs
 Of praise the little versemen joyed to take
 Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,
 For all our skill in words, equal in might
 And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make
 The name of poet terrible in just war,
 And like a crown of honour upon the fight.

text : 
Read much; the Mind, which never can be still, 
If not intent on Good, is prone to Ill. 
And where bright Thoughts, or Reas’nings just you find, 
Repose them careful in your inmost Mind. 
To deck his Chloe’s Bosom thus the Swain 
With pleasing Toil surveys th’enamel’d Plain, 
With Care selects each fragrant flow’r he meets, 
And forms one Garland of their mingled sweets.

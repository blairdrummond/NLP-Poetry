title : The Transfer

His car rolls up to the curb, you switch 
your mood, which doll to bring and rush 

 out again on the sliding steps
 of your shoes half-on, forgetting to zip 

 your new pink coat in thirty degrees, 
teeth and hair not brushed, already 

 passing the birch, mid-way between us, 
too far to hear my fading voice 

 calling my rope of reminders as I 
lean out in my robe, another Saturday 

 morning you’re pulled toward his smile, his gifts, 
sweeping on two flattened rafts 

 from mine to his, your fleeting wave 
down the rapids of the drive.

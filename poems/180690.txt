title : Insomnia

author : Rynn Williams

text : 
I try tearing paper into tiny, perfect squares—   
they cut my fingers.  Warm milk, perhaps,   
stirred counter-clockwise in a cast iron pan—   
but even then there’s burning at the edges,   
angry foam-hiss.  I’ve been told   
to put trumpet flowers under my pillow,   
I do: stamen up, the old crone said.   
But the pollen stains, and there are bees,   
I swear, in those long yellow chambers, echoing,   
the way the house does, mocking, with its longevity—   
each rib creaking and bending where I’m likely to break—   

I try floating out along the long O of lone,   
to where it flattens to loss, and just stay there   
disconnecting the dots of my night sky   
as one would take apart a house made of sticks,   
carefully, last addition to first,   
like sheep leaping backward into their pens.

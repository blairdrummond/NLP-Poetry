Undesirable you may have been, untouchable   
you were not. Not forgotten   
or passed over at the proper time. 

As estimated, you died. Things marched,   
sufficient, to that end. 
Just so much Zyklon and leather, patented   
terror, so many routine cries. 

(I have made 
an elegy for myself it   
is true) 

September fattens on vines. Roses   
flake from the wall. The smoke   
of harmless fires drifts to my eyes. 

This is plenty. This is more than enough.

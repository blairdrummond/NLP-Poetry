title : A Man Then Suddenly Stops Moving

author : Alberto RÃ­os

text : 
The old Russian spits up a plum 
fruit of the rasping sound 
he has stored in his throat 
all these lonely years

made in fact lonely by his wife 
who left him, God knows
without knowing how to cook for himself.

He examines the plum
notes its purplish consistency
almost the color and shape of her buttocks 
whose circulation was bad

which is why he himself wears a beret: 
black, good wool, certainly warm enough 
the times he remembers.

He shoots the plum
to the ground like a child
whose confidence is a game of marbles

whose flick of a thumb
is a smile inside his mouth
knowing what he knows will happen.

But his wife, Marthe 
does not spill out
when the plum breaks open.

Instead, it is a younger self 
alive and waving
just the size he remembers 
himself to have been.

The old Russian puts him onto his finger 
like a parakeet
and sits him on the shelf
with the pictures.

For the rest of his days
he nags himself constantly
into a half-sleep
surprised by this turn of events.

& sea swell, hiss of   incomprehensible flat: distance: blue long-fingered ocean and its   
                                                                                                 nothing else: nothing in the above visible except   
                                                                                                 water: water and   
always the white self-destroying bloom of   wavebreak &, upclose   
                                                                                                 roil, &   
                                                                                                 here, on what’s left of   land,    
ticking of   stays against empty flagpoles, low tide, free day, nothing   
                                                                                                 being   
                                                                                                 memorialized here today — memories float, yes,   
over the place but not memories any of   us now among the living   
                                                                                                 possess — open your   
hands — let go the scrap metal with the laughter — let go the   
                                                                                                 upstairs neighbor you did not   
                                                                                                 protect — they took him   
                                                                                                 away — let go how frightened you knew he was all   
along while you went on with your   
                                                                                                 day — your day overflowing with time and   
place — they came and got him — there are manners for every kind of   
                                                                                                 event — he stopped reading and looked up   
                                                                                                 when they came in — didn’t anyone tell you   
you would never feel at home — that there is a form of   slavery in everything — and when was it   
                                                                                                 in   your admittedly short   
                                                                                                 life you   
were permitted to believe that this lasted   
                                                                                                 forever — remove   your   hands   
from your pockets — take out that laundry list, that receipt for   
                                                                                                 everything you   
                                                                                                 pawned last night — decide whom to blame —   
                                                                                                 stick to your   
story — exclude expectation of   heavenly   
                                                                                                 reward — exclude   
                                                                                                 the milk of   
human kindness — poisoned from the start — yes — who ever expected that   
to be the mistake — with all the murderers and miracle workers — with the hovering   
                                                                                                 spidery   
                                                                                                 fairy tales — kites, angels, missiles, evening   
papers, yellow stars — clouds — those were houses that are his eyes — those were lives that   
                                                                                                 are his   
eyes — those are families, those are privacies, those are details — those are reparation   
                                                                                                 agreements, summary   
                                                                                                 judgments, those are multiplications   
on the face of   the earth that are — those are the forests, the coal seams, the   
                                                                                                 carbon sinks that are his —   
                                                                                                 as they turn into carbon sources — his — 
and the festering wounds that are — and the granary that burned — and the quick blow   
                                                                                                 administered to make it   
                                                                                                 painless, so-   
                                                                                                 called — his eyes his   yes   his blows his seed’s first   
                                                                                                 insertion into this our only soil —   
                                                                                                 &   the flower, the cut   
                                                                                                 flower in my   
                                                                                                 bouquet here,   
made from the walk we took this morning, aimless, as if   free,   
                                                                                                 where you asked me to   
                                                                                                 marry you, &   the loaf   of   
barley, millet and wheat I was able,   
                                                                                                 as a matter of course, to bring to the table, fresh-   
                                                                                                 baked,   
                                                                                                 in life.

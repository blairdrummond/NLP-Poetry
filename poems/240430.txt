title : Words Written Near a Candle

If I could begin anything
 I’d say stop asking forgiveness, especially
 theirs which was always
 the fault mentioned in your condition.
  
 Nettles could be feathers
 the moment they brush your
 ankle. At the same time: floods, earthquakes,
 the various slaveries
 hunchbacked near the fence
 to catch your glance.
  
 What is it to say that among the hired boats
 we carried our bodies well, cracked
 jokes, left the gaps 
 in our lives and not
 the page? This far to learn
 the boat does not touch the water!
  
 And if this is goodbye,
 it is a light nowhere near believing 
 and I am happy
 and it is all right to make a distance
 of a nearness, to say, ‘Boat, I have left you
 behind. Boat,
 I am with you.’

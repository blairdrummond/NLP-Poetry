text : 
you are falling 
sun shine miracle 
your lips are wet 
                        rain 
to our hearts 
floods in every opening 

on the stoop your skirt rises 
fingers go up your legs 

you are falling in the streets 

the hallways of east harlem 
the dark hallways of east harlem 
the dark hallways with mattresses 
of east harlem 
                     you are falling 

roll with us 
the avenues 
you are falling 
the night 
queen of the earth 
you are falling 
on us with lips 
& thighs 
& big round breasts 
we hold in our hands 
& hear your bomb tick 
your blood get hot 

come out 
crack your eggs 
on stupid american heads 
queen of the earth 
push us to the walls 

fall on us 
kill us 
with your love 
& tongue 

harlem queen 
fine mama 
sprinkle us with it 

there are no bargains 
pure product 
                  you are falling 

bloom bloom 
you got all 
sing 

dark 
& you shine 
grown fat 
for love 

in the dark 
you are like 
a volcano 
with a sea 
of heat 
          explode 
          you are falling 
          explode

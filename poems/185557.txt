title : Minnesota Fats Describes His Youth

author : Elizabeth Alexander

text : 
I’ve been eating 
like a sultan 
since I was two days old. 

I had a mother 
and three sisters 
who worshipped me. 

When I was two years old 
they used to plop me 
in a bed with a jillion 

satin pillows 
and spray me   
with exotic perfumes 

and lilac water, 
and then 
they would shoot me the grapes.

Rhymed Stanza

He rides at their head;
     A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,
 One slung arm is in splints, you see,
     Yet he guides his strong steed--how coldly too.
  
 He brings his regiment home--
     Not as they filed two years before,
 But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn,
 Like castaway sailors, who--stunned
           By the surf's loud roar,
     Their mates dragged back and seen no more--
 Again and again breast the surge,
     And at last crawl, spent, to shore.
  
 A still rigidity and pale--
     An Indian aloofness lones his brow;
 He has lived a thousand years
 Compressed in battle's pains and prayers,
     Marches and watches slow.
 There are welcoming shouts, and flags;
     Old men off hat to the Boy,
 Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,
     But to him--there comes alloy.
  
 It is not that a leg is lost,
     It is not that an arm is maimed,
 It is not that the fever has racked--
     Self he has long disclaimed.
  
 But all through the Seven Days' Fight,
     And deep in the Wilderness grim,
 And in the field-hospital tent,
     And Petersburg crater, and dim
 Lean brooding in Libby, there came--
     Ah heaven!--what truth to him.

text : 
We have a microsopic anatomy of the whale this gives Man assurance William Carlos Williams
We have   
a map of the universe 
for microbes, 
we have 
a map of a microbe 
for the universe. 

we have 
a Grand Master of chess 
made of electronic circuits. 

But above all 
we have 
the ability 
to sort peas, 
to cup water in our hands, 
to seek 
the right screw 
under the sofa 
for hours 

This   
gives us 
wings.

title : Shine, Perishing Republic

author : Robinson Jeffers

text : 
While this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire, 
And protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens, 

I sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth. 
Out of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother. 

You making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly 
A mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic. 

But for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption 
Never has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monster’s feet there are left the mountains. 

And boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master. 
There is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caught—they say—God, when he walked on earth.

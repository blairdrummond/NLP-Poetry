title : Thoughts of a Solitary Farmhouse

author : Franz Wright

text : 
And not to feel bad about dying.   
Not to take it so personally— 

it is only 
the force we exert all our lives 

to exclude death from our thoughts   
that confronts us, when it does arrive, 

as the horror of being excluded— . . . 
something like that, the Canadian wind 

coming in off Lake Erie 
rattling the windows, horizontal snow 

appearing out of nowhere 
across the black highway and fields like billions of white bees.

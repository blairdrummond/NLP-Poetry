title : After That

author : Primus St. John

text : 
Every story has its lean meat 
and its solid church 
so he started to rape her for years. 
However, owls close their eyes 
in the daytime 
because they’re awake all night, 
and she waited for him 
at the handle of his hunting knife 
the bells ringing afterward 
with the kind of lust 
she’s always known. 
After that her flights were silent 
and her voice, of rats and mice. 
I don’t understand sorcery or omens 
even eyes as penetrating as hers, 
but under her feathers 
and all along the tips of her flight 
where she’s let me touch her, 
I’ve kissed her fright.

Prose Poem, Symbolist

					
					One fine morning, in the country of a very gentle people, a magnificent man and woman were shouting in the public square. "My friends, I want her to be queen!" "I want to be queen!" She was laughing and trembling. He spoke to their friends of revelation, of trials completed. They swooned against each other.      In fact they were regents for a whole morning as crimson hangings were raised against the houses, and for the whole afternoon, as they moved toward groves of palm trees.

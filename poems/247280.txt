The teddy bear cholla and the fat fat


• 

Oh buckthorn, devil, whipple, teddy bear


•

Oh beavertail, oh pancake, porcupine


 •

Oh plump saguaro with your hairy arms, I love 
Each of you with a different nerve of heart. 
Especially you, so trim, so pert, your birds 
Cupped in your pits and crotches, little friends


• 

Oh areoles and aureoles, the orioles
With yellow caps are havering and hot
Making themselves a breeze with their cut wings


 •

I ask the docent and he indicates


 •

Oh nation, how you might have been, spread from 
So sure an order, with such tendering love

title : Red Stains

author : Allen Tate

text : 
In a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns
 My love and I plucked poppies breathing tales
 Of crimes now long asleep, whose once–red stains
 Dyed stabbing men, at sea with bloody sails.
 The golden sand drowsed. There a dog yelped loud;
 And in his cry rattled a hollow note
 Of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd
 That loved and bled in winy times remote.
 The poppies fainted when the moon came wide;
 The cur lay still. Our passionate review
 Of red wise folly dreamed on . . . She by my side
 Stared at the Moon; and then I knew he knew.
        And then he smiled at her; to him ’twas funny—
        Her calm steel eyes, her earth–old throat of honey!

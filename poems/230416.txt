title : Kind

author : Josephine Miles

text : 
When I think of my kindness which is tentative and quiet 
And of yours which is intense and free,
I am in elaboration of knowledge impatient
Of even the patientest immobility.

I think of my kind, which is the human fortune
To live in the world and make war among its friends, 
And of my version, which is to be moderately peaceful, 
And of your version; and must make amends

By my slow word to your wish which is mobile, 
Active and moving in its generous sphere. 
This is the natural and the supernatural 
Of humankind of which I grow aware.

author : Carl Rakosi

text : 
The ants came   
to investigate   
the dead 
bull snake,   
nibbled 
at the viscera   
and hurried off   
with full mouths   
waving wild   
antenae. 

Moths alighted,   
beetles swarmed,   
flies buzzed 
in the stomach. 

Three crows   
tugged and tore   
and flew off 
to their oak tree 
with the skin. 

In every house 
men, women and children   
were chewing beef. 

Who was it said 
“The wonder of the world   
is its comprehensibility”?

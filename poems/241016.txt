title : Exodus

author : Taha Muhammad Ali

text : 
The street is empty
 as a monk’s memory,
 and faces explode in the flames
 like acorns—
 and the dead crowd the horizon
 and doorways.
 No vein can bleed
 more than it already has,
 no scream will rise
 higher than it’s already risen.
 We will not leave!
  
 Everyone outside is waiting
 for the trucks and the cars
 loaded with honey and hostages.
 We will not leave!
 The shields of light are breaking apart
 before the rout and the siege;
 outside, everyone wants us to leave.
 But we will not leave!
  
 Ivory white brides
 behind their veils
 slowly walk in captivity’s glare, waiting,
 and everyone outside wants us to leave,
 but we will not leave!
  
 The big guns pound the jujube groves,
 destroying the dreams of the violets,
 extinguishing bread, killing the salt,
 unleashing thirst
 and parching lips and souls.
 And everyone outside is saying:
 “What are we waiting for?
 Warmth we’re denied,
 the air itself has been seized!
 Why aren’t we leaving?”
 Masks fill the pulpits and brothels,
 the places of ablution.
 Masks cross-eyed with utter amazement;
 they do not believe what is now so clear,
 and fall, astonished,
 writhing like worms, or tongues.
 We will not leave!
  
 Are we in the inside only to leave?
 Leaving is just for the masks,
 for pulpits and conventions.
 Leaving is just
 for the siege-that-comes-from-within,
 the siege that comes from the Bedouin’s loins,
 the siege of the brethren
 tarnished by the taste of the blade
 and the stink of crows.
 We will not leave!
  
 Outside they’re blocking the exits
 and offering their blessings to the impostor,
 praying, petitioning
 Almighty God for our deaths.

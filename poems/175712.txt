title : The Argument

author : Jane Kenyon

text : 
On the way to the village store   
I drive through a down-draft   
from the neighbor’s chimney.   
Woodsmoke tumbles from the eaves   
backlit by sun, reminding me 
of the fire and sulfur of Grandmother’s   
vengeful God, the one who disapproves 
of jeans and shorts for girls, 
dancing, strong waters, and adultery. 

A moment later the smoke enters 
the car, although the windows are tight,   
insinuating that I might, like Judas, 
and the foolish virgins, and the rich 
young man, have been made for unquenchable   
fire. God will need something to burn 
if the fire is to be unquenchable. 

“All things work together for the good   
for those who love God,” she said 
to comfort me at Uncle Hazen’s funeral,   
where Father held me up to see 
the maroon gladiolus that trembled 
as we approached the bier, the elaborate   
shirred satin, brass fittings, anything, 

oh, anything but Uncle’s squelched   
and made-up face. 
“No! NO! How is it good to be dead?” 
I cried afterward, wild-eyed and flushed.   
“God’s ways are not our ways,” 
she said then out of pity 
and the wish to forestall the argument.

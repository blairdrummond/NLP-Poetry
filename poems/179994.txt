Older now, he is among us in diminished form,   
clothes sagging, hat large on the fine head 

He likes the largest stores             acres of socks and tuna             where 
                   high girders look down on him also                        who 
                                       pushes his cart and leans on it a little 
      . . . something sacramental about the belittling 
perspective          something 
                   heroic about the high shadows in the niches 
                                       of the corrugated roof 
                                                                               beneath which 
                                                            under spotlights that don't spread far 
he moves with the people who comb through 
the aisles               pulling down unwieldy 
                   batches of single things                   to last them through 
                   cold time 
                                       that can't be trusted 



There he is at the far end of an avenue 
                                                                               of obelisks of paper 
head cunningly mobile like a bird's                         eyes quick like one 
                   beading on flecks that might be the 
                                       morsels that it needs 
                                                            or on grains                           or seeds 

At this its faltering morse of chirrups                     but no long address 
                   only 
                                       the same few wordchains 

                   at my feet 
                                        water water water 

                   millet beak millet crack millet 
                   air down danger aieeeeeeee 

But in their multitudes                                    horrific 
                                       squeals 
                                                          blue golden green their throats and breasts 
                                       all with the herringbone   
                                                          wingcaps that grind like blades   
                                                                              of a thousand ceiling fans in a   
                                                                                                 flaming house 

After the teak forests were hewn down               plagues 
                   of parakeets rippled down on the crops 
                                       themselves a crop             digesting 
                                                          menacing 
                                                                              no longer charming and 
                                                          observable 

but like any swarm or heap or tumulus or   
                   housing project or array of products or uncountable mass   
                                       of faces even rich ones   

                                                          repellant 



You can almost see them in his mind   
                   my father's wordchains as they click against each other   

                                                                              rapidly succeeding in his mind 

I've got to get there                                 got to 
                                        bank today            to get to sleep                         to shave 

                                                             got not to wait 
                                                                              a second longer for what I've earned 
                                                             my whole life through the right to want 
                                                                              without excuse 

and he thinks the people at the other end are 
                   idiots                        or 
                                                          when things are going well 
                                        just helpless 
                                                                           or when they know a little fact 
                                        that he does not 
                                                          (that beating flour too fine will mean the gluten 
                                                                                  cancels out the baking soda and the rolls 
                                                                                                 won't rise 
                   well          then         that they are smart 
                                                                           as whips 

Eyes almost black behind his glasses                         shining 

                   before the freezer cases of brightly packaged 
                                                          dinners with too much 
                                        sodium and fat 
                                                          rounds of chicken                           steaming 
                                                                               like eager faces against the costly frost 

he flies up into the highest branches 
                                                          of the possible air                            and then goes still 
                   at everything spread down there          for sale

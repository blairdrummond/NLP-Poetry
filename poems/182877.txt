title : [What horror to awake at night]

text : 
What horror to awake at night 
and in the dimness see the light. 
               Time is white 
               mosquitoes bite 
I’ve spent my life on nothing. 

The thought that stings. How are you, Nothing, 
sitting around with Something’s wife. 
               Buzz and burn 
               is all I learn 
I’ve spent my life on nothing.   

I’m pillowed and padded, pale and puffing 
lifting household stuffing— 
               carpets, dishes 
               benches, fishes 
I’ve spent my life in nothing.

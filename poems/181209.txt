The unsigned architecture of loneliness 
is becoming taller, finding a way farther 
above the horizontal flowering 
of the Cold War, the peonies 
and star asters of wild partisanship. 
I have a shambling gait and lonely 
hysteria, but no Terror. I am free 
to shamble past the vacant lot of my son’s 
conception, to shamble past the bar where I 
conceived adultery as a Terror 
that would be endless, flowering 
in great waves through air striated like chenille. 
I walk for a long time and try to conjure 
elsewhere in its early isolation. 
I cannot. It is all redestinated 
by the future like the loose balloons 
a janitor recovers at 6 am 
from cold light fixtures. The Cold War is ending. 
Buildings are taller and have no names. 

1. 
The romance of every ideology 
torments the romance of another. How 
beautifully, in the beginning, in 
the gale and embrace of isolation, boys 
capered over a shambles and swore oaths. 
The scent of urine in the hall at home 
was righteousness. The beautiful nude 
obscured by dust in a paperweight 
was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming 
into steep flower just as boys were flowering 
needed the correction of righteousness,   
the horizontal slag of government 
by children. Only the insane allegiances 
endure. The mad counterparts are lovers 
passion cannot explain nor circumstances 
restrict to the dead zones of irony. 
A counterpart of end of the Cold War 
is adultery. A counterpart 
of loving a divided Berlin 
unto death is fatherhood, the doting 
maintenance of sons in vacant lots 
continuing the wars of rubble 
for righteousness’ sake and for the sake 
of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity. 

Romance torments romance. The most beautiful 
moment of the twentieth century 
galed and embraced the acrid smoky air 
as the Red Army entered Berlin 
as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire 
as Red Army flags opened above Berlin 
safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future. 
Townships blackened even as they flowered. 
Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun. 
I walked for a long time and tried to conjure 
the form of kindness. It was a domestic 
animal confused in the tall grass. 
Boys set fire to the grass. History 
that opens flags opened the fire, 
and Berlin, divided from Berlin, 
began to love its children past all reason. 

2. 
My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls. 
He starves the ground 
he walks on, preparing a dead city 
to be worthy of its new flags, to shine 
as exploded windows shine, raining down 
for hours after the wrecking crews have gone. 
I have a lover now who hates children. 
The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless 
sexual pavilion of perfect form 
and perfect emptiness. I thought 
by making love to her I would conceive 
nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage, 
a violence that would last my whole life 
and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon. 

Across the luminous expressway, I see 
the shapes of charred tenements castellated, 
fading into the more tender shapes of night. 
It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow 
pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor, 
and I return to my lover’s bed to float 
in a white condom, no longer my son’s father. 
Tomorrow describes everything in detail. 
It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy 
that tenements are better than the future, 
better that peace, more likely to produce 
brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings 
without end or walls denuded of their wire. 
In the dead zone of irony before dawn, 
only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame. 

3. 
Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great 
Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride 
onto an invisible crescendo 
disappearing into gasoline fires, 
emerging as the new shapes of righteousness 
in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate. 
Oaths are secret because none suspects 
that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us 
unashamedly, like the insane homeless, 
and we do not see them. In our loneliness, 
we see a chance for love in betrayal, 
not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy 
triumph of glassy hands in free elections, 
not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings 
of children in vans reduced by fire 
to black transparencies in the morning shade. 
When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames 
she cried out “Jesus, Jesus.” Some years later, 
a failed magician who had lover her cried out 
“Joan, Joan” as the flames mocked him with a sortilege 
too easy to be unreal or profitable. 

I walk for a long time and try to conjure 
the form of loneliness without Cold War. 
It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro 
aloft and on the ground, completely still. 
Oaths are secret because none suspects 
the desperation of every object, the child 
in every atom of the misused world 
thrust towards us, crying out whatever 
sacred name it witnessed put to death 
on the ascending music of a wall. 
Our buildings are tall and have no names. 
The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers. 

4. 
Afterwards, the calm is piteous 
but insubstantial as a smell of burn 
that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire. 
Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise 
and having to invent air, invent light 
from nothing but untriggered memory. 
All things beloved are recalled to pain. 
Air recollected from the wrists of girls 
braceleted for Confirmation, crossed. 
Light recollected from between the cars 
of night trains in a deep river valley 
where islands in the river glowed like swans. 
Air recollected form a ditch in flower. 
Light recollected from the sex of flowers 
in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes. 
Air recollected from religion. 
Light recollected form the incensed clutch 
of bodies before sunrise in the oaths 
of a great and ignorant lost cause. 

Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise 
having spent the night in bed with a stranger. 
Aloft and on the ground the calm 
unfurls like flags without device or slogan. 
The inconsequence of the day ahead 
stirs airless atmospheres in darkness 
visible as daylight but without shade. 
Without Cold War, without the arbitrary 
demarcation of cause from cause, of light 
and air from the unsexed improvisations 
of memory, I cannot see to walk 
or breathe to breathe. Sex becomes applause. 
Sex becomes television, and the bastard 
avant garde of lonely architecture 
breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city 
that marks the capital of nothing now. 

5. 
A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses 
the alley from one new building into mine. 
The consolations of history are furtive, 
then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar 
of music that might have been obscene or sacred 
once, in another city, in the days 
before today. My son is well. He works 
the public ground and needs no Antigone. 
My lover sits beside him at dinner, 
sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future 
and its unbiased children, reinventing 
the sexual pavilion to accommodate 
plague wards. Romance forgives romance. 

The early isolation of this gorgeous 
century disappears into good works. 
The future is best. To put a final stop 
to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom 
and to the ruinous armies of mad boys 
whose government is rape, whose justice 
is a wall, revoke all partisanship, 
adjourn the Terror. The future is best. 
It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects 
the river islands and their glowing swans. 
But when I need to die, who will light the fire? 
What names shall I cry out and what music 
burn to a black transparency in my heart? 
The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.

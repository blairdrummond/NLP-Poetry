Rhymed Stanza

Is this the river East I heard?--
 Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred
 And the reaching wharves from the inner land
 Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand--
  
 And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud
 Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed
 From the rays of the morning sun
 Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.
  
 But look at the depth of the drippling tide
 The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;
 As the boat turns upon the silvery spread
 It leaves--strange--a shadow dead.
  
 And the very charms from the reflective river
 And from the stacks of the floating boat--
 There seemeth the quality ne'er to dissever
 Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke.

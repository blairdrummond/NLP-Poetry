The Lumieres’ first movies were of ordinary life: 
workers leaving their father’s factory; 
parents at the table while the baby eats. 
The brothers found the man’s hands at work building a wall 
just as beautiful when played backwards, 
the man leaping into the water 
and equal delight when he rose again into the air. 
It’s strange the brothers gave up so quickly on film, but they did. 
People would grow bored, they said, could see the same thing on the street. 
A novelty, they told their father, and returned to manufacturing.

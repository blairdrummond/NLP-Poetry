title : Caelica 83: [You that seek what life is in death]

author : Baron Brooke Fulke Greville

text : 
You that seek what life is in death, 
Now find it air that once was breath. 
New names unknown, old names gone: 
Till time end bodies, but souls none.
            Reader! then make time, while you be,
            But steps to your eternity.

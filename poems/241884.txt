title : Earth Day

author : Jane Yolen

text : 
I am the Earth
 And the Earth is me.
 Each blade of grass,
 Each honey tree,
 Each bit of mud, 
 And stick and stone
 Is blood and muscle, 
 Skin and bone.

 And just as I 
 Need every bit
 Of me to make
 My body fit,
 So Earth needs
 Grass and stone and tree
 And things that grow here
 Naturally.

 That’s why we 
 Celebrate this day.
 That’s why across
 The world we say:
 As long as life,
 As dear, as free,
 I am the Earth
 And the Earth is me. ﻿

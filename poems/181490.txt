title : Blowfly

Half  awake, I was imagining 
a friend’s young lover, her ash blonde hair, the smooth 
taut skin of  twenty. I imagined her 
short legs and dimpled knees. 
                                                                                     The door scraped open, 
but eyes closed, I saw nothing. The mattress sagged. 
She laid her head on my chest, and murmured love 
against my throat, almost humming, approaching song, 
so palpable I could hold her only chastely, 
if  this was chaste. I couldn’t move my hand 
even to caress her freckled shoulder. 
So this is how imagination works, I thought, 
sadly. And when at last she spoke, 
she spoke with the amused voice of my wife, 
my wife who was at work but also here, 
pleased at the confusion she was causing. 
This is a lesson about flesh, isn’t it? 
I asked. Blowfly, she whispered on my throat 
as we made tense, pensive love. Blowfly, blowfly.

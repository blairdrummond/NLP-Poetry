text : 
My mother saw the green tree toad 
on the window sill 
her first one 
since she was young. 
We saw it breathe 

and swell up round. 
My youth is no sure sign 
I’ll find this kind of thing 
tho it does sing. 
Let’s take it in 

I said so grandmother can see 
but she could not 
it changed to brown 
and town 
changed us, too.

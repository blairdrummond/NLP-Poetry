            as the meat 
            within the shell

as the shell before the caw

a bleached weed
            a fig 
dusted to sweet the skin

egg albumen of peacock 
            butterfly

held to the ivory of oxen hoof 
            pulling 
            the space

between sins                    I am

            as I am so

the host                             on the tongue
            God of Bread

complexion of conquest 
            the salt of Lot

as God is
            a crown of thorn 
            diadem of wheat

so am I the echo 
calling fossil back to name

amaranth ash                    spread across the light

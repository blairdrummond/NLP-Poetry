“Against its will, energy is doing something productive, like the devil in medieval history. The principle is that nature does something against its own will and, by self-entanglement, produces beauty.”                                                                                                             Otto Rössler

 gave birth to rocks, trees, rivers, mountains, grass
 and last, a blazing child
           so burned she died.
  
           In the land of darkness
           a mass of pollution.
  
           Ah wash her clear stream
  
           —skinny  little  girl   with   big ears
           we have passed through
                     passed through,     flesh out of flesh.

 “Shining Heavens,” Goddess of the Sun,
          her brother flung
                    mud and shit and a half-skinned pony through
                    the palace,
 so she entered a cave—shut it up with a rock—
          made the world dark.

 Ame-no-uzume, “Outrageous Heavenly Woman,” wrapped
 the numinous club-moss of Mr. Kagu round her hips, made
 a headband from the leaves of nishikigi, bound bamboo
 grass for her wristlets, and put a sounding-board down
 before the cave where the Sun Goddess stayed.
      She danced and she stamped til it echoed around, she
 danced like a goddess possessed, pulled out her nipples,
 pushed her sash down til she showed herself down below,
 and the Plain of High Heaven shook with the laughs and
 the cheers and the whistles of thousands of gods who were
 gathered to watch.

         The whole river. Clear back to each creeklet
          rock-rimmed,
                   all one basin drawing in the threads
          pacing down dry riverbeds the dance,
                mai, stomping, stepping on the gravelly bar
          step, stop, stamp of the foot. Glide and turn,
  
                   headwaters, mountains,
                            breathing icy bliss
  
          diamond-glittered bitty snowcreek
          eating the inorganic granite down.
  
          Trees once cooled the air, and clouds, ah, ghost of
                    water
                    springs gone dry. Hills of Yugoslavia clearcut
                              for the Roman fleet
                    —don’t think all that topsoil’s gone
                            it only waits.
          
          —slept on river sidebars
                   drank from muddy streams
                   grains cooked in rock-flour glacier water,
                   —dirt left on boulders
                   for a sandy heap of years,
  
          and creeks meander                    just because they swing.
  
          Stamp of the masked dancer
                   pacing tangled channels
                            putting salt and gold dust in the sea.

          Ame-no-uzume-no-mikoto bound up her sleeves with
          a cord of heavenly hi-kage vine, tied around her head a
          head-band of the heavenly ma-saki vine, bound to-
          gether bundles of sasa leaves to hold in her hands, and
          overturning a bucket before the heavenly rock-cave
          door, stamped resoundingly upon it. Then she became
          divinely possessed, exposed her breasts, and pushed
          her skirt-band down to her genitals.

          Laughter roared like thunder
                   through the plains of heaven
          and the hidden
                   Goddess of the Sun,
                   Amaterasu,
                   peeked out round the rock.
                   All the little faces of the gods gleamed
                            white                                        in the light!
                                                                                  omoshiri.

 Around her head:           nishikigi leaves        masaki vines
  
 In her hands:                                                   sasa
  
 As wristlets:                   bamboo grass
  
 sleeves tied w/:                                                hi-kage vine
  
 around her hips:             club moss

          Ame no uzume.
          What did she wear?
                   What leaves in her hair?
  
  
          How far did she push her skirt down?

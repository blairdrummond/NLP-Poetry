On the secret map the assassins   
Cloistered, the Moon River was marked   
Near the eighteen peaks and the city 
Of humiliation and defeat—wan ending   
Of the trail among dry, papery leaves   
Gray-brown quills like thoughts 
In the melodious but vast mass of today’s   
Writing through fields and swamps 
Marked, on the map, with little bunches of weeds.   
Certainly squirrels lived in the woods   
But devastation and dull sleep still   
Hung over the land, quelled 
The rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons   
Singing on marble factory walls   
Deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack   
The air with heavy invisible rods   
Pent in some sand valley from 
Which only quiet walking ever instructs.   
The bird flew over and 
Sat—there was nothing else to do. 
Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength 
Or the waterfall for a harbor 
Full of light boats that is there 
Performing for thousands of people   
In clothes some with places to go   
Or games. Sometimes over the pillar   
Of square stones its impact 
Makes a light print. 
So going around cities 
To get to other places you found   
It all on paper but the land 
Was made of paper processed   
To look like ferns, mud or other   
Whose sea unrolled its magic   
Distances and then rolled them up   
Its secret was only a pocket 
After all but some corners are darker 
Than these moonless nights spent as on a raft 
In the seclusion of a melody heard   
As though through trees 
And you can never ignite their touch   
Long but there were homes 
Flung far out near the asperities   
Of a sharp, rocky pinnacle 
And other collective places 
Shadows of vineyards whose wine   
Tasted of the forest floor 
Fisheries and oyster beds 
Tides under the pole 
Seminaries of instruction, public   
Places for electric light 
And the major tax assessment area   
Wrinkled on the plan 
Of election to public office 
Sixty-two years old bath and breakfast   
The formal traffic, shadows 
To make it not worth joining 
After the ox had pulled away the cart. 

Your plan was to separate the enemy into two groups   
With the razor-edged mountains between. 
It worked well on paper 
But their camp had grown 
To be the mountains and the map   
Carefully peeled away and not torn   
Was the light, a tender but tough bark 
On everything. Fortunately the war was solved   
In another way by isolating the two sections   
Of the enemy’s navy so that the mainland   
Warded away the big floating ships.   
Light bounced off the ends   
Of the small gray waves to tell   
Them in the observatory   
About the great drama that was being won 
To turn off the machinery 
And quietly move among the rustic landscape   
Scooping snow off the mountains rinsing 
The coarser ones that love had   
Slowly risen in the night to overflow   
Wetting pillow and petal   
Determined to place the letter 
On the unassassinated president’s desk 
So that a stamp could reproduce all this 
In detail, down to the last autumn leaf 
And the affliction of June ride 
Slowly out into the sun-blackened landscape.

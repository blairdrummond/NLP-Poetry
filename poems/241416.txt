the noun
A disease
 of the peach tree
 —a fungus
  
 distorts leaves.
 The first time
 I was taken 
  
 to see him
 I was five
 or six. A vesicle
  
 on the skin
 containing
 serum, caused
  
 by friction, 
 a burn, or other
 injury. He lived
  
 on Alabama Street
 next to Saint
 Peter’s and wore
  
 a white t-shirt,
 starched and snug.
 A similar swelling
  
 with fluid
 or air
 on the surface
  
 of a plant,
 or metal
 after cooling
  
 or the sunless
 area between
 one’s toes
  
 after a very
 long walk.
 Don’t ask me

 how it is I
 ended up 
 holding it.
  
 An outer 
 covering 
 fitted to a
  
 vessel to protect
 against torpedoes,
 mines, or to improve
  
 stability. My guess
 is that he 
 brought it out
  
 to show me
 thinking, perhaps, 
 I had never
  
 seen one
 up close,
 let alone felt
  
 the blunt weight
 of one
 in my hands.
  
 A rounded
 compartment
 protruding
  
 from the body
 of a plane.
 What came
  
 next: no
 image but
 sensation of
  
 its hammer
(my inexpert
 manipulation)

digging 
 into but not
 breaking
  
 skin—the spot
 at the base
 of my thumb
  
 balloons,
 slowly filling
 with fluid…
  
 In Spanish:
 ampolla
 —an Ampul
  
 of chrystal
 in the Middle
 Ages could be
  
 a relic containing
 the blood
 of someone
  
 holy. I’m fairly
 certain it wasn’t 
 loaded.

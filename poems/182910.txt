text : 
All overgrown by cunning moss, 
All interspersed with weed, 
The little cage of “Currer Bell” 
In quiet “Haworth” laid. 

This Bird – observing others 
When frosts too sharp became 
Retire to other latitudes – 
Quietly did the same – 

But differed in returning – 
Since Yorkshire hills are green – 
Yet not in all the nests I meet – 
Can Nightingale be seen –

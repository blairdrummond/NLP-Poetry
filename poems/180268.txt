Bargain tarts, raspberry, goose, 
he said, don't write about that 
surgery, women who have hacked off write 
all parts and natures of women 
who lose food in the bottom parts 
of refrigerators, onions, scallions, 
sour tomatoes, tiny cocktail weenies 
lost in the airless dark write 
When you give over your breast 
to cancer, for God's sake don't 
write about it. 

Write about silliness, holding hands 
in sandboxes, small girls playing fudge- 
and-find-me-alley-tag at dusk, Rochester, 
state of pubescent, New Yorka roonie. 

...day I learned to drive aimed car 
at horizon and floored it. Got there. 
God in color, no cable, firsthand. 
Going and coming back I thought I'd live. 

Not much for visions, still at sink soaking 
pinkies in sweetalmond suds, I heard Mom. 
Come on home, she said. Scared the witless bejeebies 
out of me. Next day I opted for surgery. 
Cut that mama off and saved my life. 
Big daddy surgeon said right on the mark, sweet honey. 
It was done. 

He's got a girlfriend works at his office, don't you know, 
she thinks he's licorice stick swinger. I caught them 
hugging in the mimeo room. Ain't nothing to it, he said, 
rolling his cup of a palm over the scar. Mmmmmm-mmmmm, 
this hillock is a sweet raisin, roll over baby, pour me out. 
Okeydokey. 

What came next in the woods, woolly dark trees 
don't give a fudge if what's hugging them hard 
dents in two places. I hang on for dear life. 
Filled pockets with seedpods, got bulbs 
I shoehorned into clay pots for life's sake. 
Nevertheless the disc shone hard, or didn't.

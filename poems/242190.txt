title : What to Wear Where

author : J. Patrick Lewis

text : 
When I was a boy
 In Looziana,
 We wore blue jeans
 And a red bandanna.
  
 My folks moved up
 To the state of Maine,
 We wore duck shoes
 In slicker-suit rain.
  
 My folks moved down
 To the state of Texas,
 We wore brand names
 Like Lazy X’s.
  
 Now that we’re living
 It up in Vermont,
 We wear pretty much
 Whatever we want.

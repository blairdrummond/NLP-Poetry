title : George Washingtonâ€™s Birthday:  Wondering

author : Bobbi Katz

text : 
I wonder what I would have said 
if my dad asked me, 
"Son, do you know who cut down 
my pretty cherry tree?" 
I think I might have closed my eyes 
and thought a little bit 
about the herds of elephants 
I'd seen attacking it. 
I would have heard the rat-a-tat 
of woodpeckers, at least, 
or the raging roar of a charging boar 
or some such other beast! 
Perhaps a hippopotamus 
with nothing else to do 
had wandered through our garden 
and stopped to take a chew. 
We all know George said, 
"Father, I cannot tell a lie." 
Yet I can't help but wonder ... 
Did he really try?

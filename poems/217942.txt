title : The Dead

author : Don Paterson

text : 
Our business is with fruit and leaf and bloom;    
though they speak with more than just the season's tongue—    
the colours that they blaze from the dark loam    
all have something of the jealous tang    
    
of the dead about them. What do we know of their part    
in this, those secret brothers of the harrow,    
invigorators of the soil—oiling the dirt    
so liberally with their essence, their black marrow?    
    
But here's the question. Are the flower and fruit    
held out to us in love, or merely thrust    
up at us, their masters, like a fist?    
    
Or are they the lords, asleep amongst the roots,    
granting to us in their great largesse    
this hybrid thing—part brute force, part mute kiss?

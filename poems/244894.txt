title : Talking Back to the Mad World

author : Sarah C. Harwell

text : 
I will not tend. Or water,
 pull, or yank,
 I will not till, uproot,
  
 fill up or spray.
  
 The rain comes.
 Or not. Plants: sun-fed,
 moon-hopped, dirt-stuck.
  
 Watch as flocks
 of wild phlox
  
 appear, disappear. My lazy,
 garbagey magic
 makes this nothing
 happen.
  
 I love
 the tattered
 camisole of
 nothing. The world
 runs its underbrush
 course fed by
 the nothing I give it.
  
 Wars are fought.
 Blood turns.
 Dirt is a wide unruly room.

Sometimes after hours of wine I can almost see 
   the night gliding in low off the harbor 
      down the long avenues of shop windows 

past mannequins, perfect in their gestures. 
   I leave some water steaming on the gas ring 
      and sometimes I can slip from my body, 

almost find the single word to prevent evenings 
   that absolve nothing, a winter lived alone 
      and cold. Rooms where you somehow marry 

the losses of strangers that tremble 
   on the walls like the hands 
      of the dancer next door, luminous 

with Methedrine, she taps walls for hours 
   murmuring about the silver she swears 
      lines the building, the hallways 

where each night drunks stammer their 
   usual rosary until they come to rest 
      beneath the tarnished numbers, the bulbs 

that star each ceiling. 
   I must tell you I am afraid to sit here 
      losing myself to the hour’s slow erasure 

until I know myself only by this cold weight, 
   this hand on my lap, palm up. 
      I want to still the dancer’s hands 

in mine, to talk about forgiveness 
   and what we leave behind—faces 
      and cities, the small emergencies 

of nights. I say nothing, but 
   leaning on the sill, I watch her leave 
      at that moment 

when the first taxis start rolling 
   to the lights of Chinatown, powered 
      by sad and human desire. I watch her fade 

down the street until she’s a smudge, 
   violent in the circle of my breath. A figure 
      so small I could cup her in my hands.

title : And Day Brought Back My Night

author : Geoffrey Brock

text : 
It was so simple: you came back to me 
And I was happy. Nothing seemed to matter 
But that. That you had gone away from me 
And lived for days with him—it didn’t matter. 
That I had been left to care for our old dog 
And house alone—couldn’t have mattered less! 
On all this, you and I and our happy dog 
Agreed. We slept. The world was worriless. 

I woke in the morning, brimming with old joys 
Till the fact-checker showed up, late, for work 
And started in: Item: it’s years, not days. 
Item: you had no dog. Item: she isn’t back, 
In fact, she just remarried. And oh yes, item: you 
Left her, remember? I did? I did. (I do.)

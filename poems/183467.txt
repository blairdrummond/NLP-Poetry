title : Hexameter

text : 
Hold, memory, a vision out of Greece: 
The west wind breathes a ripening breath 
As each pear, pendant and golden, brushes 
Another, where four tilled acres glisten 
Winter and summer: fig, olive, currant, 
And the heavy succulent pomegranate 
—Sunstruck for the plucker’s hand. 
All this a stranger sees, palm on lintel, 
Sees the stately women of the royal rooms 
Murmuring over linen, looms humming; 
Sees boys, on pedestals, shine torches 
Which fire the eyes of Alkinöos’s hounds. 

So much of heroism wondrously found 
(Like a glinting pebble in a child’s hand, 
Borne upward to imagination’s shallows),   
As I’d gaze at snow blanketing West End, 
Hearing the story my father burnished 
Over a month of nights, so that the voyage 
Of the telling faded into the hours lived 
Beside that voice—whiskey rough—again 
Taking up the exile’s lament: hekatomb, 
Distaff, honeyed wine . . . Some bleary god 
Come down from heaven’s height, as snow 
Descends on elms and, beyond our window, 
Odysseus, beggared and unknown, moves 
Toward the great bow of gnarled revenge. 
Father, I stand beside you now, your right arm! 
Pitch pine torches reveal a stranger’s son 
Holding still-thrumming wood in his hand.

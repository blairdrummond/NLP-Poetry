title : The Astronomical Hen

Like hearts marked out but not yet colored in,   
Each of her feathers has a black edge,   
as if an India-ink mantilla stretched 

from uncleaved neck to her fantail. The pen,   
homemade, spilled some darkness now and then.   
She doesn’t lack for suitors. Poor rooster, 

who pours his own loud heart out to her,   
surely his begging does no more than force   
her to peck out a crooked tattoo in the dirt 

of the pen. Is she stumped, sad, anorexic?   
It’s perfectly clear she doesn’t lay eggs.   
Can it be she’s simply in love with herself? 

Her eye obsidian, eye of the world, 
at night she watches the stars drop from shelf   
to shelf, to minor études she unfurls 

in her head. By day she hunts and re-pecks   
the pinprick holes of her intricate sketch.   
If she’s done by dusk the first stars can rise.

Fish 
    always accurately know where to move and when, 
    and likewise 
    birds have an accurate built-in time sense 
    and orientation. 

Humanity, however, 
    lacking such instincts resorts to scientific 
    research. Its nature is illustrated by the following 
    occurrence. 

A certain soldier 
    had to fire a cannon at six o’clock sharp every evening. 
    Being a soldier he did so. When his accuracy was 
    investigated he explained: 

I go by 
    the absolutely accurate chronometer in the window 
    of the clockmaker down in the city. Every day at seventeen 
    forty-five I set my watch by it and 
    climb the hill where my cannon stands ready. 
    At seventeen fifty-nine precisely I step up to the cannon 
    and at eighteen hours sharp I fire. 

And it was clear 
    that this method of firing was absolutely accurate. 
    All that was left was to check that chronometer. So 
    the clockmaker down in the city was questioned about 
    his instrument’s accuracy. 

Oh, said the clockmaker, 
    this is one of the most accurate instruments ever. Just imagine, 
    for many years now a cannon has been fired at six o’clock sharp. 
    And every day I look at this chronometer 
    and always it shows exactly six. 

Chronometers tick and cannon boom.

title : Postmodern Rez Edge Inhalation: Paint Thinner Sublime

author : Gordon Henry Jr.

text : 
Chemical angels ride into this vacant room
as walls and windows drip away
into western fronts, post depression farm
boundaries barely barb-wired together, enclosed
stone pile pastures a gray horse standing still,
facing north, a snort of breath drifting
to a rail car passing horizon
the wind hinting the spirit of ice
nights so long you can only hope
the red blood circling for warmth
in your cells donâ€™t freeze here
with the rest of this lost American dream.

title : N

author : Randall Mann

text : 
has crawled out of the ocean   
to carry us from sleep, like sleep,   

the gray of outer Sunset portending   
the gray of inner Sunset. And so on.   

On the N, one should invent   
intricate fictions for the lives   

of the passengers: time is a game.   
Soon we will be underground.   

But first, the long lush green   
of Duboce Park, the happiness of dogs!   

Good-bye now to their owners   
eyeing one another. Good-bye   

to the park's locked men's room,   
where once a man was found dead,   

his penis shoved into his own mouth.   
The world continues, the engine   

of the world the letter N.

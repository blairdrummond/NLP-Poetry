There Is No Age

Rhymed Stanza

There is no age, this darkness and decay 
Is by a radiant spirit cast aside,
Young with the ageless youth that yesterday 
Bent to the yoke of flesh immortal pride.

What though in time of thunder and black cloud 
The Spirit of the Innermost recedes
Into the depths of Being, stormy browed, 
Obscured by a long life of dreams and deeds?

There is no age?the swiftly passing hour 
That measures out our days of pilgrimage 
And breaks the heart of every summer flower, 
Shall find again the child's soul in the sage.

There is no age, for youth is the divine; 
And the white radiance of the timeless soul 
Burns like a silver lamp in that dark shrine 
That is the tired pilgrim's ultimate goal.

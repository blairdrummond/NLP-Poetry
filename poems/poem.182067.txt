I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night 
The sweep of each sad lost wave 
The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving 
The little cry of a man to a man 
A shadow falling across the greyer night 
And the sinking of the small star. 

Then the waste, the far waste of waters 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness. 

Remember, thou, oh ship of love 
Thou leavest a far waste of waters 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness.

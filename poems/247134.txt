text : 
This is not a book. Otherwise, by now 
We would love each other. 
You would not put me first, 
Out of a kind habit, under your coat 
And clutch—as a sudden rain 
Spate down. For I've seen it done 
For the hardly known.

No, you would know with a book you love: 
How nothing held your eyes 
The way the words did, with archer-focus: 
How each arrow heading toward you 
Was slowed by the dripping beehive 
On its spike—

Nothing else could hold what you are 
Still: I pressed your heart in speech and saw 
What a musical you let rush, nothing 
Else in the eyes. This is not a book, 
But a streak—
Words cross reins— 
The brow splits, veins careen.

pilipinas to petatlán
she whispers desert trees, thorn-ridged, trickling yellow candles; roots spilling snakes’ blood
 virgin of ribboned silk; virgin of gold filigree
 one day’s walk westward, a crucifix of fisherman’s dinghy dimensions washes ashore
 virgin adorned in robe of shark embryo and coconut husk
 she fingers mollusks, wraps herself in sea vines 
 virgin of ocean voyage peril
 she will herself born
 virgin of mud brick ruins; virgin of sandstorm echoes
 she is saint of commonplaces; saint of badlands
 virgin of jade, camphor, porcelain; virgin of barter for ghosts
 penitents, earthdivers of forgotten names praying skyward
 virgin of scars blossomed from open veins of fire
 she slips across the pacific’s rivers of pearldiving children
 virgin of copper coins
 she is bloodletting words, painting unlikeness
 virgin of anachronism
 children stained with berries and rust, their skeletons bend, arrow-tipped; smoke blurs eyes’ edges
 virgin of mineral depletion; virgin of mercury
 at other altitudes she remembers to breathe; a monument scraping cloud
 virgin of tin deposits extracted from mountains
 these are not divinations; there is goldleaf about her skin
 virgin of naming and renaming places in between

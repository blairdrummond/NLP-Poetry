title : Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow

author : Robert Duncan

text : 
as if it were a scene made-up by the mind,   
that is not mine, but is a made place, 

that is mine, it is so near to the heart,   
an eternal pasture folded in all thought   
so that there is a hall therein 

that is a made place, created by light   
wherefrom the shadows that are forms fall. 

Wherefrom fall all architectures I am 
I say are likenesses of the First Beloved   
whose flowers are flames lit to the Lady. 

She it is Queen Under The Hill 
whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words   
that is a field folded. 

It is only a dream of the grass blowing   
east against the source of the sun 
in an hour before the sun’s going down 

whose secret we see in a children’s game   
of ring a round of roses told. 

Often I am permitted to return to a meadow   
as if it were a given property of the mind   
that certain bounds hold against chaos, 

that is a place of first permission,   
everlasting omen of what is.

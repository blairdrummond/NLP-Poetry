Sonnet

Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape, 
    Might not compare with his pure ivorie white, 
    On whose faire front a poet's pen may write, 
Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape, 
His love-enticing delicate soft limbs, 
    Are rarely fram'd t'intrap poore gazine eies: 
    His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies, 
With lovely tincture which Apollo's dims. 
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet, 
    His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe, 
    Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion. 
His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set. 
    Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring, 
    Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring?

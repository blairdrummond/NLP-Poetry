MAY 3, 1863
When Clifford wasn’t back to camp by nine,   
I went to look among the fields of dead   
before we lost him to a common grave.   
But I kept tripping over living men   
and had to stop and carry them to help   
or carry them until they died, 
which happened more than once upon my back.   
And I got angry with those men because   
they kept me from my search and I was out 
still stumbling through the churned-up earth at dawn,   
stopping to stare into each corpse’s face,   
and all the while I was writing in my head   
the letter I would have to send our father,   
saying Clifford was lost and I had lost him. 

I found him bent above a dying squirrel   
while trying to revive the little thing.   
A battlefield is full of trash like that —   
dead birds and squirrels, bits of uniform.   
Its belly racked for air. It couldn’t live.   
Cliff knew it couldn’t live without a jaw.   
When in relief I called his name, he stared,   
jumped back, and hissed at me like a startled cat. 
I edged up slowly, murmuring “Clifford, Cliff,”   
as you might talk to calm a skittery mare,   
and then I helped him kill and bury all 
the wounded squirrels he’d gathered from the field. 
It seemed a game we might have played as boys.   
We didn’t bury them all at once, with lime,   
the way they do on burial detail,   
but scooped a dozen, tiny, separate graves. 
When we were done he fell across the graves 
and sobbed as though they’d been his unborn sons.   
His chest was large — it covered most of them.   
I wiped his tears and stroked his matted hair,   
and as I hugged him to my chest I saw 
he’d wet his pants. We called it Yankee tea.

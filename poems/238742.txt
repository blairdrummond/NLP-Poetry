title : Nests in Elms

author : Michael Field

text : 
The rooks are cawing  up and down the trees! 
Among their nests they caw. O sound I treasure, 
Ripe as old music is, the summer's measure, 
Sleep at her gossip, sylvan mysteries, 
With prate and clamour to give zest of these— 
In rune I trace the ancient law of pleasure, 
Of love, of all the busy-ness of leisure, 
With dream on dream of never-thwarted ease. 
O homely birds, whose cry is harbinger 
Of nothing sad, who know not anything 
Of sea-birds' loneliness, of Procne's strife, 
Rock round me when I die! So sweet it were 
To die by open doors, with you on wing 
Humming the deep security of life.

The instructor said, 

      Go home and write 
      a page tonight. 
      And let that page come out of you— 
      Then, it will be true. 

I wonder if it’s that simple? 
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.   
I went to school there, then Durham, then here   
to this college on the hill above Harlem.   
I am the only colored student in my class.   
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,   
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,   
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,   
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator   
up to my room, sit down, and write this page: 

It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me   
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what 
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you. 
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.   
(I hear New York, too.) Me—who? 

Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.   
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.   
I like a pipe for a Christmas present, 
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach. 
I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like 
the same things other folks like who are other races.   
So will my page be colored that I write?   
Being me, it will not be white. 
But it will be 
a part of you, instructor. 
You are white— 
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you. 
That’s American. 
Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me.   
Nor do I often want to be a part of you. 
But we are, that’s true! 
As I learn from you, 
I guess you learn from me— 
although you’re older—and white— 
and somewhat more free. 

This is my page for English B.

title : On A Diet

author : William Matthews

text : 
Eat all you want  but don’t swallow it.  —Archie Moore 
The ruth of soups and balm of sauces 
I renounce equally. What Rorschach saw 
in ink I find in the buttery frizzle 
in the sauté pan, and I leave it behind,   
and the sweet peat-smoke tang of bananas,   
and cream in clots, and chocolate. I give 
away the satisfactions of food and take 
desire for food: I’ll be travelling light 

to the heaven of revisions. Why be   
adipose: an expense, etc., 
in a waste, etc.? Something like 
the body of the poet’s work, with its 
pale shadows, begins to pare and replace 
the poet’s body, and isn’t it time?

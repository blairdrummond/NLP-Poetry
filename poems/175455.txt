title : Uninvited Reader

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
She notes in the poem she's reading where the disembodied 
voice speaking encounters "an ugly old woman" 
just momentarily, in part of a single line, in one 
of the many long corridors and sharp turnings of the poem, 
so that she's quickly lost to view. That's me, she thinks, 
I'm an ugly old woman, I who sit here reading this poem 
and its ugly old woman phrase and the poet, when he stumbled 
over her splayed, swollen legs, registered her presence, 
her inheritance, her baggage of limitations-ugly, old, 
woman-but never knew, couldn't, because who could 
know, who can stop and know her ... And this reader keeps 
thinking, loving, understanding, trapped in her eye 
following the voice on and on while somewhere back in the poem 
in a blank passage an ugly old woman sits against a wall.

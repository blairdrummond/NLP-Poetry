title : December 31st

author : Richard Hoffman

text : 
All my undone actions wander
 naked across the calendar,
 
a band of skinny hunter-gatherers,
 blown snow scattered here and there,
 
stumbling toward a future
 folded in the New Year I secure
 
with a pushpin: January’s picture
 a painting from the 17th century,
 
a still life: Skull and mirror,
 spilled coin purse and a flower.

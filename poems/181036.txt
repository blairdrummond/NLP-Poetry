title : “Though I am young, and cannot tell”

author : Ben Jonson

text : 
Though I am young, and cannot tell 
    Either what Death or Love is well, 
Yet I have heard they both bear darts, 
    And both do aim at human hearts. 
And then again, I have been told 
    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold; 
So that I fear they do but bring 
    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing. 

As in a ruin we it call 
    One thing to be blown up, or fall; 
Or to our end like way may have 
    By a flash of lightning, or a wave; 
So Love’s inflamèd shaft or brand 
    May kill as soon as Death’s cold hand; 
Except Love’s fires the virtue have 
    To fight the frost out of the grave.

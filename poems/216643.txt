title : The Snow Leopard

author : Jason Gray

text : 
 In the Metro Toronto Zoo
He pads on grassy banks behind a fence,
          with measured paces slow and tense.

          Beyond his cage his thoughts are sharp and white;
                  he lives a compelled anchorite.

                  A solid ghost gone blind with all the green,
                              he waits and waits to be unseen.

                                                         -For Paul Strong

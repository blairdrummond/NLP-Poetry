The Troop Ship 
Isaac Rosenberg 
1890-1918
Georgian
England




Grotesque and queerly huddled 
 Contortionists to twist 
 The sleepy soul to a sleep, 
 We lie all sorts of ways 
 And cannot sleep. 
 The wet wind is so cold, 
 And the lurching men so careless, 
 That, should you drop to a doze, 
 Wind's fumble or men's feet 
 Is on your face.

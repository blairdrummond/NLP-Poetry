title : What to Count On

author : Peggy Shumaker

text : 
Not one star, not even the half moon          
       on the night you were born
 Not the flash of salmon
        nor ridges on blue snow
 Not the flicker of raven’s
        never-still eye
 Not breath frozen in fine hairs
        beading the bull moose’s nostril
 Not one hand under flannel
        warming before reaching
 Not burbot at home under Tanana ice
        not burbot pulled up into failing light
 Not the knife blade honed, not the leather sheath
 Not raw bawling in the dog yard
        when the musher barks gee
 Not the gnawed ends of wrist-thick sticks
        mounded over beaver dens
 Not solar flares scouring the earth over China
 Not rime crystals bearding a sleek cheek of snow
 Not six minutes more of darkness each day
 Not air water food words touch
 Not art
 Not anything we expect
 Not anything we expect to keep
 Not anything we expect to keep us alive

 Not the center of the sea
 Not the birthplace of the waves
 Not the compass too close to true north to guide us 

 Then with no warning
        flukes of three orcas
                  rise, arc clear of sea water

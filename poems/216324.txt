title : Tea-Strainer

author : Joyelle McSweeney

text : 
Leaf-keep, un-sibyl; if the soul
 Has the weight of a swallow, what less
 Has the weight of a sip? You equal
 This riddle, unposed in your dish
 As a hand at rest in a lap. Held to,
 You hold back what can't be
 Prevented, what's no more palatable
 For that: the unfine; formerly, our future.

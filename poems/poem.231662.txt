Rhymed Stanza

Dark frost was in the air without,
   The dusk was still with cold and gloom, 
When less than even a shadow came 
      And stood within the room.

But of the three around the fire,
   None turned a questioning head to look, 
Still read a clear voice, on and on,
      Still stooped they o'er their book.

The children watched their mother's eyes
   Moving on softly line to line;
It seemed to listen too--that shade,
      Yet made no outward sign.

The fire-flames crooned a tiny song,
   No cold wind stirred the wintry tree; 
The children both in Faerie dreamed
      Beside their mother's knee.

And nearer yet that spirit drew
   Above that heedless one, intent 
Only on what the simple words
      Of her small story meant.

No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind,
   No memory her bosom stirred, 
Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,
      'Twas surely three who heard.

Yet when, the story done, she smiled
   From face to face, serene and clear, 
A love, half dread, sprang up, as she
      Leaned close and drew them near.

In three directions 
are two storms. 
I instruct the edges 
of my hands to become 
irises, to shatter 
in that way, 
in three directions. 
There's nothing behind me. 

Viols 
claw beneath our fences 
at the elevation 
of sound to pure 
unsanctity, the moment 
of simultaneity: 
airplanes seeming to collide and not colliding, the crow alighting 
in the manner of a seabird, the carbomb a more than momentary poppy. 

The bad total 
of death points one 
direction. 
It moves 
at the edge of my hand 
at the memorial service, 
viols useless now 
laid across their breasts, 
the attitude of submission.   

I was eating dinner in a tall room. I was the third guest. 
I felt a tightening in my asshole, and the yellow wine turned 
to red, turned to your hand on another's woven onto tapestry. 
How the month of June became our sons, so many bridges for one 
river, was the story always delighted you. 

The carbomb was faster. 
Simultaneous with the iris the viol 
shatters in three directions. 
Everything I have taken 
claws helplessly at sunlight 
that won't defend itself. 
The red one is the poppy.

title : House of Shadows. Home of Simile

One afternoon of summer rain   
my hand skimmed a shelf and I found   
an old florin. Ireland, 1950. 

We say like or as and the world is   
a fish minted in silver and alloy, 

an outing for all the children,   
an evening in the Sandford cinema,   
a paper cone of lemonade crystals and 

say it again so we can see   
androgyny of angels, edges to a circle,   
the way the body works against the possible— 

and no one to tell us, now or ever,   
why it ends, why   
it always ends. 

I am holding   
two whole shillings of nothing,   
observing its heaviness, its uselessness. 

And how in the cool shadow of nowhere   
a salmon leaps up to find a weir   
it could not even know   
was never there.

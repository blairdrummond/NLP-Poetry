title : Requiem for the Plantagenet Kings

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
For whom the possessed sea littered, on both shores,   
Ruinous arms; being fired, and for good, 
To sound the constitution of just wars, 
Men, in their eloquent fashion, understood. 

Relieved of soul, the dropping-back of dust,   
Their usage, pride, admitted within doors; 
At home, under caved chantries, set in trust,   
With well-dressed alabaster and proved spurs   
They lie; they lie; secure in the decay 
Of blood, blood-marks, crowns hacked and coveted,   
Before the scouring fires of trial-day 
Alight on men; before sleeked groin, gored head,   
Budge through the clay and gravel, and the sea   
Across daubed rock evacuates its dead.

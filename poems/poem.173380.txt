When my grave is broke up again 
       Some second guest to entertain, 
       (For graves have learn'd that woman head, 
       To be to more than one a bed) 
                And he that digs it, spies 
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone, 
                Will he not let'us alone, 
And think that there a loving couple lies, 
Who thought that this device might be some way 
To make their souls, at the last busy day, 
Meet at this grave, and make a little stay? 

         If this fall in a time, or land, 
         Where mis-devotion doth command, 
         Then he, that digs us up, will bring 
         Us to the bishop, and the king, 
                To make us relics; then 
Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I 
                A something else thereby; 
All women shall adore us, and some men; 
And since at such time miracles are sought, 
I would have that age by this paper taught 
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought. 

         First, we lov'd well and faithfully, 
         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why; 
         Difference of sex no more we knew 
         Than our guardian angels do; 
                Coming and going, we 
Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals; 
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals 
Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free; 
These miracles we did, but now alas, 
All measure, and all language, I should pass, 
Should I tell what a miracle she was.

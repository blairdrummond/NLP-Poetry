title : sweet reader, flanneled and tulled

author : Olena Kalytiak Davis

text : 
Reader unmov’d and Reader unshaken, Reader unseduc’d   
and unterrified, through the long-loud and the sweet-still   
I creep toward you. Toward you, I thistle and I climb. 

I crawl, Reader, servile and cervine, through this blank   
season, counting—I sleep and I sleep. I sleep, 
Reader, toward you, loud as a cloud and deaf, Reader, deaf 

as a leaf. Reader: Why don’t you turn 
pale? and, Why don’t you tremble? Jaded, staid   
Reader, You—who can read this and not even 

flinch. Bare-faced, flint-hearted, recoilless   
Reader, dare you—Rare Reader, listen   
and be convinced: Soon, Reader, 

soon you will leave me, for an italian mistress:   
for her dark hair, and her moon-lit   
teeth. For her leopardi and her cavalcanti, 

for her lips and clavicles; for what you want   
to eat, eat, eat. Art-lover, rector, docent!   
Do I smile? I, too, once had a brash artless 

feeder: his eye set firm on my slackening 
sky. He was true! He was thief! In the celestial sense   
he provided some, some, some 

(much-needed) relief. Reader much-slept with, and Reader I will die 
without touching, You, Reader, You: mr. small- 
weed, mr. broad-cloth, mr. long-dark-day. And the italian mis- 

fortune you will heave me for, for 
her dark hair and her moonlit-teeth. You will love her well in- 
to three-or-four cities, and then, you will slowly 

sink. Reader, I will never forgive you, but not, poor   
cock-sure Reader, not, for what you think. O, Reader   
Sweet! and Reader Strange! Reader Deaf and Reader 

Dear, I understand youyourself may be hard- 
pressed to bare this small and un-necessary burden   
having only just recently gotten over the clean clean heart- 

break of spring. And I, Reader, I am but the daughter   
of a tinker. I am not above the use of bucktail spinners,   
white grubs, minnow tails. Reader, worms 

and sinkers. Thisandthese curtail me   
to be brief: Reader, our sex gone 
to wildweather. YesReaderYes—that feels much-much 

better. (And my new Reader will come to me empty- 
handed, with a countenance that roses, lavenders, and cakes.   
And my new Reader will be only mildly disappointed. 

My new Reader can wait, can wait, can wait.) Light- 
minded, snow-blind, nervous, Reader, Reader, troubled, Reader, 
what’d ye lack? Importunate, unfortunate, Reader: 

You are cold. You are sick. You are silly. 
Forgive me, kind Reader, forgive me, I had not intended to step this quickly this far 
back. Reader, we had a quiet wedding: he&I, theparson 

&theclerk. Would I could, stead-fast, gracilefacile Reader! Last,   
good Reader, tarry with me, jessa-mine Reader. Dar- 
(jee)ling, bide! Bide, Reader, tired, and stay, stay, stray Reader, 

true. R.: I had been secretly hoping this would turn into a love 
poem. Disconsolate. Illiterate. Reader,   
I have cleared this space for you, for you, for you.

title : Night Flight

author : George Bilgere

I am doing laps at night, alone 
In the indoor pool. Outside 
It is snowing, but I am warm 
And weightless, suspended and out 
Of time like a fly in amber. 
 
She is thousands of miles 
From here, and miles above me, 
Ghosting the stratosphere, 
Heading from New York to London. 
Though it is late, even 
At that height, I know her light 
Is on, her window a square 
Of gold as she reads mysteries 
Above the Atlantic. I watch 
 
The line of black tile on the pool’s 
Floor, leading me down the lane. 
If she looks down by moonlight, 
Under a clear sky, she will see 
Black water. She will see me 
Swimming distantly, moving far 
From shore, suspended with her 
In flight through the wide gulf 
As we swim toward land together.

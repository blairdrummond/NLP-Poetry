title : That Magnificent Part the Chorus Does about Tragedy

There is a theory of crying that tears are the body’s way of 
releasing excess elements from the brain. There is a theory of 
dreaming that each one serves to mend something torn, like 
cells of new skin lining up to cover a hole. I’m not one to have 
dreams about flying, but last week we were thirty feet above the 
bay—this was where we went to discuss things, so that no matter 
what we decided it was only we two out there, and we’d have 
to fly back together. I’m not one to have dreams where animals 
can speak, but last night a weeping mare I’d been told to bridle 
wanted me to save her. We discussed what was left of her ability 
to take children for rides—how much trot, how much canter— 
but I wasn't sure I could do it, having already bridled her and 
all. I was once very brave. Once I was very brave. I was very 
brave once. I boarded a plane before dawn. I carried all those 
heavy bags. I stayed up the whole night before folding the house 
into duffel bags. I took a curl from the base of your skull and 
opened the door to the rusty orange wagon and weighed those 
heavy duffel bags and smiles at the airport official. I boarded 
a tiny propeller plane and from a tiny window I watched you walk 
back to the rusty orange station wagon. They say the whole world 
is warming by imperceptible degrees. I watched the rusty orange 
wagon go whizzing by.

Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

No one can tell me,
    Nobody knows,
 Where the wind comes from,
    Where the wind goes.
  
 It's flying from somewhere
    As fast as it can,
 I couldn't keep up with it,
    Not if I ran.
  
 But if I stopped holding
    The string of my kite,
 It would blow with the wind
    For a day and a night.
  
 And then when I found it,
    Wherever it blew,
 I should know that the wind
    Had been going there too.
  
 So then I could tell them
    Where the wind goes . . . 
 But where the wind comes from
    Nobody knows.

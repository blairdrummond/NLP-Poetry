Sonnet

December 1789
When infant Reason first exerts her sway, 
And new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display; 
Then let the growing race employ your care 
Then guard their opening minds from Folly's snare; 
Correct the rising passions of their youth, 
Teach them each serious, each important truth; 
Plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast, 
Destroy each vice that might its growth molest; 
Point out betimes the course they should pursue; 
Then with redoubled pleasure shall you view 
Their reason strengthen as their years increase, 
Their virtue ripen and their follies cease; 
Like corn sown early in the fertile soil, 
The richest harvest shall repay your toil.

title : The Invention of Cuisine

author : Carol Muske-Dukes

text : 
Imagine for a moment 
the still life of our meals, 
meat followed by yellow cheese, 
grapes pale against the blue armor of fish. 

Imagine a thin woman 
before bread was invented, 
playing a harp of wheat in the field.   
There is a stone, and behind her 
the bones of the last killed, 
the black bird on her shoulder 
that a century later 
will fly with trained and murderous intent. 

They are not very hungry 
because cuisine has not yet been invented.   
Nor has falconry, 
nor the science of imagination. 

All they have is the pure impulse to eat,   
which is not enough to keep them alive   
and this little moment 
before the woman redeems 
the sprouted seeds at her feet 
and gathers the olives falling from the trees   
for her recipes. 

Imagine. Out in the fields 
this very moment 
they are rolling the apples to press, 
the lamb turns in a regular aura of smoke. 

See, the woman looks once behind her   
before picking up the stone, 
looks back once at the beasts, 
the trees,   
that sky 
above the white stream 
where small creatures live and die   
looking upon each other 
as food.

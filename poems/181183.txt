title : From the Towers

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
Insanity is not a want of reason. 
It is reason's overgrowth, a calculating kudzu. 

Explaining why, in two-ton manifesti, thinkers sally forth 
with testaments and pipe bombs. Heaven help us: 

spare us all your meaningful designs. Shine down or 
shower forth, but (for the earthling's sake) ignore 
all prayers followed by against, or for. Teach us to bear 

life's senselessness, our insignificance, and more; 
let's call that sanity. The terrifying prospect isn't some 
escapist with a novel, fond of comfort, munching sweetsâ€” 

it is the busy hermeneut, so serious he's sour, intent on making 
meaning of us all, and bursting from the towers to the streets.

a love supreme, a love supreme  a love supreme, a love supreme
Sex fingers toes 
in the marketplace 
near your father's church 
in Hamlet, North Carolina— 
witness to this love 
in this calm fallow 
of these minds, 
there is no substitute for pain:   
genitals gone or going, 
seed burned out, 
you tuck the roots in the earth,   
turn back, and move 
by river through the swamps, 
singing: a love supreme, a love supreme; 
what does it all mean? 
Loss, so great each black 
woman expects your failure 
in mute change, the seed gone. 
You plod up into the electric city— 
your song now crystal and   
the blues. You pick up the horn   
with some will and blow 
into the freezing night: 
a love supreme, a love supreme— 

Dawn comes and you cook   
up the thick sin 'tween   
impotence and death, fuel 
the tenor sax cannibal 
heart, genitals, and sweat 
that makes you clean— 
a love supreme, a love supreme— 

Why you so black? 
cause I am 
why you so funky? 
cause I am 
why you so black? 
cause I am 
why you so sweet? 
cause I am 
why you so black? 
cause I am 
a love supreme, a love supreme: 

So sick 
you couldn't play Naima, 
so flat we ached 
for song you'd concealed 
with your own blood, 
your diseased liver gave 
out its purity, 
the inflated heart 
pumps out, the tenor kiss, 
tenor love: 
a love supreme, a love supreme— 
a love supreme, a love supreme—

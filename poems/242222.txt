Love Song for the Newly Divorced
One day, you will awake from your covering 
and that heart of yours will be totally mended, 
and there will be no more burning within. 
The owl, calling in the setting of the sun
and the deer path, all erased. 
And there will be no more need for love 
or lovers or fears of losing lovers 
and there will be no more burning timbers 
with which to light a new fire, 
and there will be no more husbands or people 
related to husbands, and there will be no more 
tears or reason to shed your tears. 
You will be as mended as the bridge 
the working crew has just reopened. 
The thick air will be vanquished with the tide 
and the river that was corrupted by lies 
will be cleansed and totally free. 
And the rooster will call in the setting sun 
and the sun will beckon homeward, 
hiding behind your one tree that was not felled.

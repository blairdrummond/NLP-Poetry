Humps of shell emerge from dark water. 
Believers toss hunks of bread,   
hoping the fat reptilian heads   
will loom forth from the murk   
and eat. Meaning: you have been   
heard. 

I stood, breathing the stench of mud   
and rotten dough, and could not feel   
encouraged. Climbed the pilgrim hill   
where prayers in tissue radiant tubes   
were looped to a tree. Caught in 
their light, a hope washed over me   
small as the hope of stumbling feet   
but did not hold long enough 
to get me down. 

Rickshas crowded the field, 
announced by tinny bells. 
The friend beside me, whose bread   
floated and bobbed, 
grew grim. They’re full, I told him.   
But they always eat mine. 

That night I told the man I love most   
he came from hell. It was also 
his birthday. We gulped lobster   
over a white tablecloth in a country 
where waves erase whole villages, annually,   
and don’t even make our front page.   
Waiters forded the lulling currents   
of heat. Later, my mosquito net   
had holes. 

All night, I was pitching something,   
crumbs or crusts, into that bottomless pool   
where the spaces between our worlds take root.   
He would forgive me tomorrow.   
But I wanted a mouth to rise up   
from the dark, a hand, 
any declarable body part, to swallow   
or say, This is water, that is land.

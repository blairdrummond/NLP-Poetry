The one cashier is dozing— 
head nodding, slack mouth open, 
above the cover girl spread out before her on the counter 
smiling up   
with indiscriminate forgiveness 
and compassion for everyone 
who isn’t her.   

Only the edge   
is visible of the tightly spooled   
white miles   
of what is soon   
to be the torn off 
inch by inch receipts,   
and the beam of green light in the black glass 
of the self scanner   
drifts free in the space that is the sum 
of the cost of all the items that tonight 
won’t cross its path. 

Registers of feeling too precise   
too intricate to feel   
except in the disintegrating 
traces of a dream— 
panopticon of cameras   
cutting in timed procession 
from aisle to aisle 
to aisle on the overhead screens 
above the carts asleep inside each other— 
above the darkened   
service desk, the pharmacy, the nursery, 
so everywhere inside the store 
is everywhere at once   
no matter where— 
eternal reruns   
of stray wisps of steam   
that rise   
from the brightly frozen, 
of the canned goods and food stuffs 
stacked in columns onto columns 
under columns pushed together 
into walls of shelves   
of aisles all celestially effacing 
any trace   
of bodies that have picked   
packed unpacked and placed   
them just so   
so as to draw bodies to the 
pyramid of plums,   
the ziggurats   
of apples and peaches and 
in the bins the nearly infinite   
gradations and degrees of greens   
misted and sparkling. 

A paradise of absence, 
the dreamed of freed 
from the dreamer, bodiless 
quenchings and consummations   
that tomorrow will draw the dreamer 
the way it draws the night tonight   
to press the giant black moth 
of itself against the windows 
of fluorescent blazing.

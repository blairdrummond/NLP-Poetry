text : 
I wanted it: arc of red and blue   
strobing my skin, sirens singing   
my praises, the cinching embrace   
of the cot as the ambulance   
slammed shut and steered away.   
More than needle-pierce   
or dragging blade, I wanted the swab   
of alcohol and cotton, the promise   
of gauze-covered cure.   
My mother saved anyone    
who asked, but never me,   
never the way I wanted:   
her palms skimming my limbs   
for injury, her fingers finding   
what hurt, her lips whispering,   
I got here just in time.

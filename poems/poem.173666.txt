Sonnet, Assonance

Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies! 
   O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air! 
   The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there! 
Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves'-eyes! 
The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies! 
   Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare! 
   Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare!  
Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize. 

Buy then! bid then! -- What? -- Prayer, patience, alms, vows. 
Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard boughs! 
   Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows! 
These are indeed the barn; withindoors house 
The shocks. This piece-bright paling shuts the spouse 
   Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his hallows.

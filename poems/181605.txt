title : Pompeii

author : Charles Bernstein

text : 
The rich men, they know about suffering 
That comes from natural things, the fate that 
Rich men say they can't control, the swell of   
The tides, the erosion of polar caps 
And the eruption of a terrible 
Greed among those who cease to be content 
With what they lack when faced with wealth they are   
Too ignorant to understand. Such wealth   
Is the price of progress. The fishmonger   
Sees the dread on the faces of the trout 
And mackerel laid out at the market   
Stall on quickly melting ice. In Pompeii 
The lava flowed and buried the people 
So poems such as this could be born.

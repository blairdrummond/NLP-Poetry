My sister and I went out to them with sugar
 cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down
 to eat from our palms. We led them over
 to the long white fence on which we climbed
 to the topmost rail, then threw our legs
 across their backs, clutching the reins to steady
 ourselves against their girth, steering them out
 into the hills until we were lost, or thought
 we were, only to find ourselves at Judith
 Creek or Holcomb Rock where weâ€™d turn back
 in the early dark, gripping their manes, crouching
 low, galloping hard on the high soft
 road across the fields to the open barn.

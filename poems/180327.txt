My mother died one summer— 
the wettest in the records of the state. 
Crops rotted in the west. 
Checked tablecloths dissolved in back gardens. 
Empty deck chairs collected rain. 
As I took my way to her 
through traffic, through lilacs dripping blackly 
behind houses 
and on curbsides, to pay her 
the last tribute of a daughter, I thought of something 
I remembered 
I heard once, that the body is, or is 
said to be, almost all 
water and as I turned southward, that ours is 
a city of it, 
one in which 
every single day the elements begin 
a journey towards each other that will never, 
given our weather, 
fail— 
       the ocean visible in the edges cut by it, 
cloud color reaching into air, 
the Liffey storing one and summoning the other, 
salt greeting the lack of it at the North Wall and, 
as if that wasn't enough, all of it 
ending up almost every evening 
inside our speech— 
coast canal ocean river stream and now 
mother and I drove on and although 
the mind is unreliable in grief, at 
the next cloudburst it almost seemed 
they could be shades of each other, 
the way the body is 
of every one of them and now 
they were on the move again—fog into mist, 
mist into sea spray and both into the oily glaze 
that lay on the railings of 
the house she was dying in 
as I went inside.

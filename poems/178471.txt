title : Waiting There

author : Michael Anania

text : 
As others or ourselves   
let’s say—furtive, then, 

inconsequent and sad— 
or on the edge of thought, 

perhaps, or into some   
predictable meandering, 

the outward accelerations   
of water against its shore 

dissipating into erosions,   
cuts and counter-cuts, 

remembered as landscape,   
the convenient certainties 

of an abandoned past.   
Is it tree or treeline 

or the massing of leaves   
against the sky or color 

freed from shadow or something   
of color deepening against shade, 

the sensible bluff that heaves   
above the bluff’s presumed 

insensible marl? River,   
again, always enclosed 

by its own turnings, its   
own turnings overgrown.

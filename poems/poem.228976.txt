Rhymed Stanza

There is a change?and I am poor;
Your love hath been, nor long ago,
A fountain at my fond heart's door,
Whose only business was to flow;
And flow it did; not taking heed
Of its own bounty, or my need.

What happy moments did I count!
Blest was I then all bliss above!
Now, for that consecrated fount
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,
What have I? shall I dare to tell?
A comfortless and hidden well.

A well of love?it may be deep?
I trust it is,?and never dry:
What matter? if the waters sleep
In silence and obscurity.
?Such change, and at the very door
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.

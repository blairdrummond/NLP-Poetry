text : 
for Shanshan
The wave of that year 
flooded the sands on the mirror 
to be lost is a kind of leaving 
and the meaning of leaving 
the instant when all languages 
are like shadows cast from the west 

life's only a promise 
don't grieve for it 
before the garden was destroyed 
we had too much time 
debating the implications of a bird flying 
as we knocked down midnight's door 

alone like a match polished into light 
when childhood's tunnel 
led to a vein of dubious ore 
to be lost is a kind of leaving 
and poetry rectifying life 
rectifies poetry's echo

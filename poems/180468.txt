title : The Truth

I’m not going to lie 
Through my teeth to you 
Like the poets from Minnesota, 
The South, and the West, 
And New York City. 

Most of all in life 
I would like to fuck a thirteen-year-old again, 
And I don’t have any hesitations 
About saying I’d rather be Marlon Brando 
Than I would T. S. Eliot, etc. 

I have more respect for Muhammad Ali 
Than any other living man. 
Of course I’ve tried Esquire, 
But my shoes aren’t platforms 
And I don’t know shit about canoes. 

Although I can’t prove it, 
Most poets work for the highway dept. 
There are more of them than there are 
Flies and engineers. 
And I stink like a dead mule under an overpass.

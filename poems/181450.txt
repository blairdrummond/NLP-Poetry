title : Then

text : 
For the first time, I listen to a lost 
and secret recording of us 
making love near-on ten years ago. 

I recognize your voice, your sounds, 
though if I knew no better, 
I could be any man in any room. 

After, the rising sounds of rising 
and of dressing and once 
as you step up close to the deck, 

perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing 
the chorus of Sunday Morning. 
I call on you to hurry and we leave. 

It does not end then; the tape rolls on. 
A few late cars which sigh by 
might have passed us walking away 

triumphant, unaware weâ€™ve left behind 
this mop and mow mechanism 
of silence to which we may never return.

title : from Chloe and Myra

author : Sophia Burrell

text : 
Blindfold I should to Myra run,
And swear to love her ever;
Yet when the bandage was undone,
Should only think her clever.

With the full usage of my eyes,
I Chloe should decide for;
But when she talks, I her despise,
Whom, dumb, I could have died for!

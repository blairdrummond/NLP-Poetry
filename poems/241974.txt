title : Les É﻿ventails, Portraits of Passion

author : Nathalie Handal

text : 
The shadows of birds fading on a fighter’s back
  
 The undressing of words on an unstamped postcard
  
 The wet swings in the distant park
  
 The jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers
  
 The laughter of a boy before a bird
  
 The song of two flutes, two swords, two bracelets, two fingers
  
 The stare of a wave before a pearl
  
 The yearning between the legs of a farmer’s wife
  
 The opening of doors             closing midday
  
 The sudden howling of our muse—and 
  
 les éventails—disturbing the guest inside of us

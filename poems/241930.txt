title : Aunt

author : Al Young

text : 
She talks too loud, her face
 a blur of wrinkles & sunshine
 where her hard hair shivers
 from laughter like a pine tree
 stiff with oil & hotcombing
  
 O & her anger realer than gasoline
 slung into fire or lighted mohair
 She’s a clothes lover from way back
 but her body’s too big to be chic
 or on cue so she wear what she want
 People just gotta stand back &
 take it like they do Easter Sunday when
 the rainbow she travels is dry-cleaned
  
 She laughs more than ever in spring
 stomping the downtowns, Saturday past
 work, looking into JC Penney’s checking
 out Sears & bragging about how when she
 feel like it she gon lose weight &
 give up smoking one of these sorry days
  
 Her eyes are diamonds of pure dark space
 & the air flying out of them as you look
 close is only the essence of living
 to tell, a full-length woman, an aunt
 brown & red with stalking the years

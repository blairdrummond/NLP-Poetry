Rhymed Stanza

Oh, what a lantern, what a lamp of light
        Is thy pure word to me
 To clear my paths and guide my goings right!
                  I swore and swear again,
        I of the statues will observer be,
                  Thou justly dost ordain.
  
 The heavy weights of grief oppress me sore:
        Lord, raise me by the word,
 As thou to me didst promise heretofore.
                  And this unforced praise
        I for an off'ring bring, accept, O Lord,
                  And show to me thy ways.
  
 What if my life lie naked in my hand,
        To every chance exposed!
 Should I forget what thou dost me command?
                  No, no, I will not stray
        From thy edicts though round about enclosed
                  With snares the wicked lay.
  
 Thy testimonies as mine heritage,
        I have retained still:
 And unto them my heart's delight engage,
                  My heart which still doth bend,
        And only bend to do what thou dost will,
                  And do it to the end.

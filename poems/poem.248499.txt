Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

(For Holy Cross Day, 1914)

Clouds is under clouds and rain


For there will not come again


Two, the beloved sire and son


Whom all gifts were rained upon.

 

Kindness is all done, alas,


Courtesy and grace must pass,


Beauty, wit and charm lie dead,


Love no more may wreathe the head.


 
Now the branch that waved so high


No wind tosses to the sky;


There's no flowering time to come,


No sweet leafage and no bloom.


 
Percy, golden-hearted boy,


In the heyday of his joy


Left his new-made bride and chose


The steep way that Honour goes.

 

Took for his the deathless song


Of the love that knows no wrong:


Could I love thee, dear, so true


Were not Honour more than you?


 
(Oh, forgive, dear Lovelace, laid


In this mean Procrustean bed!)


Dear, I love thee best of all


When I go, at England's call.


 
In our magnificent sky aglow


How shall we this Percy know


Where he shines among the suns


And the planets and the moons?


 
Percy died for England, why,


Here's a sign to know him by!


There's one dear and fixed star,


There's a youngling never far.

 

Percy and his father keep


The old loved companionship,


And shine downward in one ray


Where at Clouds they wait for day.

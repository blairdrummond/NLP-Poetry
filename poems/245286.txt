As phantoms direct life from the shadows,
  
                                                                              I feel
 I leaned on something,
                                          and it broke.
  
 My father on the porch with his crosswords said,
 this must be what it feels like to be dead;
  
 When I returned from the dead there was no one to greet me,
 but still you are glad—
  
 I wander the ruins the way my tongue
 wanders my missing teeth,
 the bricks and mortar of Deep Deuce
 rotted like molars in an ancient mouth;
  
 Here Charlie Christian might have walked—
  
 The astrologer counseled patience
 and creative imaging:
  
                                  Step One: Visualize
 an object that symbolizes the accursed influence. Picture yourself throwing 
 it into a furnace.
  
                                  Step two: Visualize
 the person who is responsible for the curse. Imagine one end of a rope
 is tied around your waist and the other around that person. Picture yourself cutting
 the rope with a chainsaw as you call out, “You have no power over me!”
  
                                  Step three: Repeat
 twice a day for eleven days . . .
  
 You visualize her green boots inside the furnace . . .
  
—No. You are in a crematorium and you see
 her perfect and corruptible body on a tray sliding into fire;
  
 Then you see yourself cutting the rope that ties you together with a saw;
  
 And then at last your own imperfect and corruptible body—I mean, me—calls out
  
 and I jump in after her.

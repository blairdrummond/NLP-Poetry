title : Enough

author : Suzanne Buffam

text : 
I am wearing dark glasses inside the house 
 To match my dark mood.
  
 I have left all the sugar out of the pie.
 My rage is a kind of domestic rage.
  
 I learned it from my mother
 Who learned it from her mother before her
  
 And so on.
 Surely the Greeks had a word for this.
  
 Now surely the Germans do. 
 The more words a person knows
  
 To describe her private sufferings
 The more distantly she can perceive them.
  
 I repeat the names of all the cities I’ve known
 And watch an ant drag its crooked shadow home.
  
 What does it mean to love the life we’ve been given?
 To act well the part that’s been cast for us?
  
 Wind. Light. Fire. Time.  
 A train whistles through the far hills.
  
 One day I plan to be riding it.

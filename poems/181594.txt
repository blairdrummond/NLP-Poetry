title : On Marriage

author : Meghan O'Rourke

text : 
Stone by stone, body by body in the grass: 
For this we trade our lone compass, 

Become swans instead, adrift in glaze- 
Light, kilned in the arms of each other 

Into vessel-vassal new. Or shrew, 
As the case may be. What would you do?   

Listen to the footsteps in the thistles. 
Put the kettle on for tea, and whisper it to me.

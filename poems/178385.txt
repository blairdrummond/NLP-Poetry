title : Reaching Yellow River

“It isn’t a game for girls,”   
he said, grabbing a fifth   
with his right hand, 
the wind with his left. 

“For six days 
I raced Jack Daniels. 
He cheated, told jokes.   
Some weren’t even funny. 

That’s how come he won.   
It took a long time 
to reach this Yellow River.   
I’m not yet thirty, 

or is it thirty-one? 
Figured all my years 
carried the same hard thaw.   
Out here, houselights hid 

deep inside the trees. 
For awhile I believed this road   
cut across to Spring Creek   
and I was trucking home. 

I could kid you now,   
say I ran it clean, 
gasping on one lung,   
loaded by a knapsack 

of distrust and hesitation.   
I never got the tone 
in all the talk of cure. 
I sang Honor Songs, crawled 

the railroad bridge to Canada.   
Dizzy from the ties, 
I hung between both worlds.   
Clans of blackbirds circled 

the nearby maple trees. 
The dark heart of me said 
no days more than these. 
As sundown kindled the sumacs, 

stunned by the river’s smile,   
I had no need for heat, 
no need to feel ashamed.   
Inside me then the sound 

of burning leaves. Tell them 
I tumbled through a gap on the horizon.   
No, say I stumbled through a hummock   
and fell in a pit of stars. 

When rain weakened my stride,   
I heard them singing 
in a burl of white ash, 
took a few more days to rave 

at them in this wood. 
Then their appaloosas nickered   
in the dawn and they came   
riding down a close ravine. 

Though the bottle was empty,   
I still hung on. Foxtails beat   
the grimace from my brow   
until I took off my pain 

like a pair of old boots. 
I became a hollow horn filled   
with rain, reflecting everything.   
The wind in my hand 

burned cold as hoarfrost 
when my grandfather nudged me   
and called out 
my Lakota name.”

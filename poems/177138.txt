title : Hammer

Every Wednesday when I went to the shared office   
before the class on the comma, etc.,   
there was on the desk, among 
the notes from students aggrieved and belly-up   
and memos about lack of funding 
and the quixotic feasibility memos   
and labyrinthine parking memos 
and quizzes pecked by red ink 
and once orange peels, 
a claw hammer. 
There when I came and there when I left,   
it didn’t seem in anyone’s employ. 
There was no room left to hang anything. 
It already knew how to structure an argument.   
It already knew that it was all an illusion   
that everything hadn’t blown apart   
because of its proximity to oblivion,   
having so recently come from oblivion itself.   
Its epiphyses were already closed. 
It wasn’t my future that was about to break its wrist   
or my past that was god knows where.   
It looked used a number of times 
not entirely appropriately 
but its wing was clearly healed. 
Down the hall was someone with a glove   
instead of a right hand. 
A student came by looking for who?   
Hard to understand 
then hard to do. 
I didn’t think much of stealing it, 
having so many hammers at home. 
There when I came, there when I left. 
Ball peen, roofing, framing, sledge, one 
so small of probably only ornamental use. 
That was one of my gifts, 
finding hammers by sides of roads, in snow, inheriting,   
one given by a stranger for a jump in the rain.   
It cannot be refused, the hammer. 
You take the handle, test its balance 
then lift it over your head.

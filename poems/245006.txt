title : Voiced Stops

author : Forrest Gander

text : 
Summer’s sweet theatrum! The boy lunges through
 The kitchen without comment, slams the door. An
 Elaborate evening drama. I lug his forlorn weight
 From floor to bed. Beatific lips and gap-
  
 Toothed. Who stayed late to mope and swim, then
 Breach chimneys of lake like a hooked gar
 Pressing his wet totality against me. Iridescent
 Laughter and depraved. Chromatic his constant state. At
  
 Ten, childhood took off like a scorched dog. Turned
 His head to see my hand wave from a window, and I too saw
 The hand untouching, distant from. What fathering-
 Fear slaked the impulse to embrace him? Duration!
  
 An indefinite continuation of life. I whirled out wings. Going
 Toward. And Lord Child claimed now, climbing loose.

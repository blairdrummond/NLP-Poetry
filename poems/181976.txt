title : Feuilleton 5: The Buskers

text : 
Four buskers almost balkanized, tonight, 
August 4th, the Place de la Contrescarpe. 

Every one of them in wind and limb complete, 
The accordionist all but a hunchback-- 

After the first melodious flourishes were done, 
The clarinet began to take his instrument apart, 

Blowing shorter tunes, to show the way it worked; 
But on a keyboard hanging from his neck 

The carpenter pianist banged out routine chords 
And the violin a beanpole man was fingering 

Sliced through the edges of catalpa leaves 
With long shrieks, rat trills, and all in fun. 

Cars now orbiting the quadrangle of trees 
Turned into tubes filled with human meat, 

Notes took the scent of carnage from their lager 
(Even so, the buzz of talk, no way to stop it) 

And cherry red the track suit of its rider, 

The sliced leaves, iron chains that link 
Old mooring posts around the beds of flowers. 

Fogged the eye with fright, and meaning trouble 
Identical white camper caravans 


Rolled into view, the one behind the other, 
For things to jump from, us to be flung into. 

Rohmahniyah! he shouts, shaking his money pot, 
The clarinettist, Ceausescu, fini! Whereupon, 

Classic features, stepping light and fresh 
From reeds that told secrets of a beauty parlour. 

A nice Missouri girl, in gree, with pearls 
To plug each earlobe, pushed her wicker chair aside; 

Showing a dainty midriff, on steady legs 
She strolled across the street, as if to depollute 

With every breath, every stride, the air 
Our music for a moment had iunhabited. 

Then the white, lost caravans came back again, 
Carnation milk inside, stringbags of potatoes, 

Family snug inside, in each a Belgian grandpa, 
Peering every which way, at the wheel.

One hand slops suds on, one 
hustles them down like a blind. 
Brusque noon glare, filtered thus, 
loosens and glows. For five or 
six minutes he owns the place, 
dismal coffee bar, and us, its 
huddled underemployed. A blade, 
black line against the topmost glass, 

begins, slices off the outer lather, 
flings it away, works inward, 
corrals the frothy middle, and carves, 
with quick cuts, the stuff down, 
not looking for anything, beneath 
or inside. Homes to the last, 
cleans its edges, grooms it for 
the end, then shaves it off 

and flings it away. Which is 
splendid, and merciless. And all 
in the wrist. Then, he looks at us. 
We makers of filth, we splashers 
and spitters. We sitters and watchers. 
Who like to see him work. 
Who love it when he leaves 
and gives it back: our grim hideout, 
half spoiled by clarity.

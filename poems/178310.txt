title : The Ditch

In the ditch, half-ton sections of cast-iron molds   
hand-greased at the seams with pale petroleum waste   
and screw-clamped into five-hundred-gallon cylinders   
drummed with rubber-headed sledges inside and out   
to settle tight the wet concrete 
that, dried and caulked, became Monarch Septic Tanks;   
and, across the ditch, my high school football coach,   
Don Compo, spunky pug of a man, 
bronze and bald, all biceps and pecs, 
raging at some “attitude” of mine 
he snipped from our argument about Vietnam— 
I mean raging, scarlet, veins bulging from his neck,   
he looked like a hard-on stalking back and forth— 
but I had started college, this was a summer job, 
I no longer had to take his self-righteous, hectoring shit,   
so I was chuckling merrily, saying he was ludicrous,   
and he was calling me “College Man Ryan” 
and, with his steel-toed workboot, kicking dirt 
that clattered against the molds and puffed up between us. 

It’s probably not like this anymore, but every coach 
in my hometown was a lunatic. Each had different quirks 
we mimicked, beloved bromides whose parodies we intoned,   
but they all conducted practice like boot camp, 
the same tirades and abuse, no matter the sport, 
the next game the next battle in a neverending war.   
Ex-paratroopers and -frogmen, at least three 
finally convicted child molesters, genuine sadists 
fixated on the Commie menace and our American softness 
that was personally bringing the country to the brink of collapse— 
in this company, Don Compo didn’t even seem crazy. 
He had never touched any of us; 
his violence was verbal, which we were used to, 
having gotten it from our fathers 
and given it back to our brothers and one another 
since we had been old enough to button our own pants.   
Any minute—no guessing what might trigger it— 
he could be butting your face mask and barking up your nostrils,   
but generally he favored an unruffled, moralistic carping,   
in which I, happy to spot phoniness, 
saw pride and bitterness masquerading as teaching. 
In the locker room, I’d sit where I could roll my eyeballs   
as he droned, but, across the ditch, 
he wasn’t lecturing, but fuming, flaring 
as I had never seen in four years of football, 
and it scared and thrilled me to defy him and mock him 
when he couldn’t make me handwash jockstraps after practice   
or do pushups on my fingertips in a mud puddle. 

But it was myself I was taunting. I could see my retorts   
snowballing toward his threat to leap the ditch   
and beat me to a puddle of piss (“you craphead, 
you wiseass”), and my unspading a shovel from a dirt pile   
and grasping its balance deliberately down the handle   
and inviting him to try it. 
Had he come I would have hit him, 
There’s no question about that. 
For a moment, it ripped through our bewilderment,   
which then closed over again 
like the ocean 
if an immense cast-iron mold were dropped in.   
I was fired when the boss broke the tableau.   
“The rest of you,” he said, “have work to do,”   
and, grabbing a hammer and chisel, Don Compo   
mounted the mold between us in the ditch 
and with one short punch split it down the seam.

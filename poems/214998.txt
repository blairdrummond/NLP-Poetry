The tortures of lumbago consumed Aunt Madge, 
And Leah Vest, once resigned from schoolmarming, 
Could not be convinced to leave the house, 
And Mrs. Mary Hogan, after birthing her fifth son, 

Lay bedfast for the last fifty-two years of her life, 
Reporting shooting pains that would begin 
High in her back and shear downward to the feet, 
As though, she said, she had been glazed in lightning; 

And also, men, broken on bridges and mills, 
Shell-shocked veterans, religious alcoholics— 
Leldon Kilpatrick, Johnson Suggs, Whitey Carlyle: 
They came and sat there too, leafing through 

Yellowing Pageants and Progressive Farmers; 
And, one by one, all entered in and talked 
While the good doctor gargled a dark chaff 
In his pipe and took down symptoms, 

Annotating them on his hidden chart— 
Numbness, neuralgia, the knotted lymph, 
The clammy palms—and then he’d scratch 
His temple’s meaningful patch of white 

And scrawl out his unfailing barbiturate prescription 
To be filled by his pharmacist brother-in-law 
Until half the county had gathered as in a lap— 
The quantum ache, the mutiny in every house. 

How much pain, how many diseases 
Consigned to the mythological, the dropped 
Ovaries, the torn-up nerves, what women 
Said, what men wanted to believe? Part of it 

Laughable, I know. Still I want someone 
To see, now that they lie safe in graves 
Beyond the vacant stores, that someone 
Listened and, hearing the wrong at the heart, 

Named it something that sounded real, whatever 
They lived through and died of. I remember 
Mrs. Lyle who called it a thorn in the flesh, 
And Mr. Appleton, who had no roof in his mouth.

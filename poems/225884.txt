title : The Lifeguard

text : 
In a stable of boats I lie still, 
From all sleeping children hidden.   
The leap of a fish from its shadow   
Makes the whole lake instantly tremble.   
With my foot on the water, I feel   
The moon outside 

Take on the utmost of its power. 
I rise and go out through the boats.   
I set my broad sole upon silver, 
On the skin of the sky, on the moonlight,   
Stepping outward from earth onto water   
In quest of the miracle 

This village of children believed   
That I could perform as I dived 
For one who had sunk from my sight.   
I saw his cropped haircut go under.   
I leapt, and my steep body flashed   
Once, in the sun. 

Dark drew all the light from my eyes.   
Like a man who explores his death 
By the pull of his slow-moving shoulders,   
I hung head down in the cold, 
Wide-eyed, contained, and alone 
Among the weeds, 

And my fingertips turned into stone   
From clutching immovable blackness.   
Time after time I leapt upward 
Exploding in breath, and fell back   
From the change in the children’s faces   
At my defeat. 

Beneath them I swam to the boathouse   
With only my life in my arms 
To wait for the lake to shine back 
At the risen moon with such power   
That my steps on the light of the ripples   
Might be sustained. 

Beneath me is nothing but brightness   
Like the ghost of a snowfield in summer.   
As I move toward the center of the lake,   
Which is also the center of the moon,   
I am thinking of how I may be 
The savior of one 

Who has already died in my care.   
The dark trees fade from around me.   
The moon’s dust hovers together.   
I call softly out, and the child’s 
Voice answers through blinding water.   
Patiently, slowly, 

He rises, dilating to break 
The surface of stone with his forehead.   
He is one I do not remember 
Having ever seen in his life. 
The ground I stand on is trembling   
Upon his smile. 

I wash the black mud from my hands.   
On a light given off by the grave   
I kneel in the quick of the moon   
At the heart of a distant forest   
And hold in my arms a child   
Of water, water, water.

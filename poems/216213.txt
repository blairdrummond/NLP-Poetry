text : 
Where does such sadness in wood come 
 from? How could longing live in these 
 wires? The box looks like the most fragile 
 coffin tuned for sound. And laid 
 across the knees of this woman 
 it looks less like a baby nursed 
 than some symbolic Piet√†, 
 and the stretched body on her lap 
 yields modalities of lament 
 and blood, yields sacrifice and sliding 
 chants of grief that dance and dance toward 
 a new measure, a new threshold, 
 a new instant and new year which 
 we always celebrate by 
 remembering the old and by 
 recalling the lost and honoring 
 those no longer here to strike these 
 strings like secrets of the most 
 satisfying harmonies, as 
 voices join in sadness and joy 
 and tell again what we already 
 know, have always known but forget, 
 from way back in the farthest cove, 
 from highest on the peaks of love.

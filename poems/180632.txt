title : Echo

author : Christina Rossetti

text : 
Come to me in the silence of the night; 
   Come in the speaking silence of a dream; 
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright 
   As sunlight on a stream; 
      Come back in tears, 
O memory, hope, love of finished years. 

Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet, 
   Whose wakening should have been in Paradise, 
Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet; 
   Where thirsting longing eyes 
      Watch the slow door 
That opening, letting in, lets out no more. 

Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live 
   My very life again tho’ cold in death: 
Come back to me in dreams, that I may give 
   Pulse for pulse, breath for breath: 
      Speak low, lean low, 
As long ago, my love, how long ago.

title : Through these Pale Cold Days

author : Isaac Rosenberg

text : 
Through these pale cold days 
What dark faces burn 
Out of three thousand years, 
And their wild eyes yearn, 

While underneath their brows 
Like waifs their spirits grope 
For the pools of Hebron againâ€” 
For Lebanon's summer slope. 

They leave these blond still days 
In dust behind their tread 
They see with living eyes 
How long they have been dead.

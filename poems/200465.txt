title : The Nuns Assist at Childbirth

author : Barbara Howes

text : 
Robed in dungeon black, in mourning   
For themselves they pass, repace   
The dark linoleum corridors 
Of humid wards, sure in the grace 

Of self-denial. Blown by duty,   
Jet sails borne by a high wind, 
Only the face and hands creep through   
The shapeless clothing, to remind 

One that a woman lives within 
The wrappings of this strange cocoon.   
Her hands reach from these veils of death   
To harvest a child from the raw womb. 

The metal scales of paradox 
Tip here then there. What can the nun   
Think of the butchery of birth, 
Mastery of the flesh, this one 

Vigorous mystery? Rude life 
From the volcano rolls and pours,   
Tragic, regenerate, wild. Sad, 
The unborn wait behind closed doors.

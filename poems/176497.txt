“If you open the brain 
                                  from whence sprang Solomon and Aristotle   
and separate the lips 
                                 in the fissure of Sylvius 
a triangle of cortex 
                               will appear. 
This is the Island of Reil.” 

Well put, anatomist. 
                               We are all careful, men of earth   
(a blind man can sense a post). 

Thus Newton pondered on falling apples 
and a Mixtec carved a humanist in jaguar bone. 

“How happy I was,” 
                            wrote the scientist after a long illness,   
“when once again 
                         I had something to investigate.”

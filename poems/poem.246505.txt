The stems of  the sun bent over the eye
             The sleeping man
The whole of  the earth
             And this head heavy with fear
In the night
This complete hole
                         Vast
And even so streaming with water
The noise
           The peals of  little bells mingled with the
               Clinking of glasses
                    And bursts of laughter
The head moves
On the carpet the body shifts
And turns over the warm spot
                At the slipping feet of  the animal
It's that they're waiting 
                           For the summons of the shock
And the signal of  the eyelid
The ray relaxes
                           Sleep
                                       Light
And what is left shines at the edge of  the white rock

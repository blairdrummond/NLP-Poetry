Blank Verse

MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act 
Of Satan done in Paradise, and how 
Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, 
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, 
Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye 
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart 
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, 
Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde 
Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd, 
Complete to have discover'd and repulst 
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. 
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd 
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, 
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, 
Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, 
And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. 
Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste 
Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad 
For Man, for of his state by this they knew, 
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln 
Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news 
From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd 
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare 
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt 
With pitie, violated not thir bliss. 
About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes 
Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know 
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream 
Accountable made haste to make appear 
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, 
And easily approv'd; when the most High 
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, 
Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. 

Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd 
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, 
Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, 
Which your sincerest care could not prevent, 
Foretold so lately what would come to pass, 
When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. 
I told ye then he should prevail and speed 
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't 
And flatter'd out of all, believing lies 
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine 
Concurring to necessitate his Fall, 
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse 
His free Will, to her own inclining left 
In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now 
What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass 
On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, 
Which he presumes already vain and void, 
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, 
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find 
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. 
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. 
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee 
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd 
All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell. 
Easie it might be seen that I intend 
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee 
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd 
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, 
And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. 

So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright 
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son 
Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full 
Resplendent all his Father manifest 
Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. 

Father Eternal, thine is to decree, 
Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will 
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd 
Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge 
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, 
Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, 
When time shall be, for so I undertook 
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine 
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom 
On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so 
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most 
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. 
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none 
Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg'd, 
Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, 
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law 
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. 

Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose 
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, 
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant 
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence 
Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. 
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods 
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. 
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low 
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour 
To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in 
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole 
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both 
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard 
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes 
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard, 
And from his presence hid themselves among 
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God 
Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. 

Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet 
My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, 
Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, 
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: 
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change 
Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. 
He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first 
To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; 
Love was not in thir looks, either to God 
Or to each other, but apparent guilt, 
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, 
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. 
Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. 

I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice 
Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom 
The gracious judge without revile repli'd. 

My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, 
But still rejoyc't, how is it now become 
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who 
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree 
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? 

To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. 
O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand 
Before my judge, either to undergoe 
My self the total Crime, or to accuse 
My other self, the partner of my life; 
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, 
I should conceal, and not expose to blame 
By my complaint; but strict necessitie 
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint 
Least on my head both sin and punishment, 
However insupportable, be all 
Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou 
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. 
This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, 
And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, 
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, 
That from her hand I could suspect no ill, 
And what she did, whatever in it self, 
Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; 
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. 

To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. 
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey 
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, 
Superior, or but equal, that to her 
Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place 
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, 
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd 
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd 
Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract 
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts 
Were such as under Government well seem'd, 
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part 
And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. 

So having said, he thus to Eve in few: 
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? 

To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, 
Confessing soon, yet not before her judge 
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. 

The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. 

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay 
To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd 
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre 
The Guilt on him who made him instrument 
Of mischief, and polluted from the end 
Of his Creation; justly then accurst, 
As vitiated in Nature: more to know 
Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) 
Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last 
To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, 
Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: 
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. 

Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst 
Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; 
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, 
And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. 
Between Thee and the Woman I will put 
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; 
Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. 

So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd 
When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, 
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, 
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave 
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht 
In open shew, and with ascention bright 
Captivity led captive through the Aire, 
The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, 
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; 
Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, 
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. 

Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie 
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring 
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will 
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. 

On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. 
Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, 
And eaten of the Tree concerning which 
I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, 
Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow 
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; 
Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth 
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, 
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, 
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou 
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, 
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. 

So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, 
And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day 
Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood 
Before him naked to the aire, that now 
Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin 
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, 
As when he wash'd his servants feet so now 
As Father of his Familie he clad 
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, 
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; 
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: 
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins 
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more 
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, 
Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. 
To him with swift ascent he up returnd, 
Into his blissful bosom reassum'd 
In glory as of old, to him appeas'd 
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man 
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. 
Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, 
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, 
In counterview within the Gates, that now 
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame 
Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, 
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. 

O Son, why sit we here each other viewing 
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives 
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides 
For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be 
But that success attends him; if mishap, 
Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n 
By his Avenger, since no place like this 
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. 
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, 
Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large 
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, 
Or sympathie, or som connatural force 
Powerful at greatest distance to unite 
With secret amity things of like kinde 
By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade 
Inseparable must with mee along: 
For Death from Sin no power can separate. 
But least the difficultie of passing back 
Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe 
Impassable, Impervious, let us try 
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine 
Not unagreeable, to found a path 
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World 
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument 
Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, 
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, 
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. 
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn 
By this new felt attraction and instinct. 

Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. 
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong 
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre 
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw 
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste 
The savour of Death from all things there that live: 
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. 

So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell 
Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock 
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, 
Against the day of Battel, to a Field, 
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd 
With sent of living Carcasses design'd 
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. 
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd 
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, 
Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. 
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste 
Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark 
Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) 
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met 
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea 
Tost up and down, together crowded drove 
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. 
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse 
Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive 
Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way 
Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich 
Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle 
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, 
As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm 
As Delos floating once; the rest his look 
Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, 
And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, 
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach 
They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on 
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge 
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall 
Immovable of this now fenceless world 
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, 
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. 
So, if great things to small may be compar'd, 
Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, 
From Susa his Memnonian Palace high 
Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont 
Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, 
And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. 
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art 
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock 
Over the vext Abyss, following the track 
Of Satan, to the self same place where hee 
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe 
From out of Chaos to the out side bare 
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant 
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made 
And durable; and now in little space 
The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n 
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell 
With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes 
In sight, to each of these three places led. 
And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, 
To Paradise first tending, when behold 
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright 
Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing 
His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: 
Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear 
Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. 
Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk 
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape 
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act 
By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded 
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought 
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend 
The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd 
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun 
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth 
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd 
By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire 
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, 
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood 
Not instant, but of future time. With joy 
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, 
And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot 
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't 
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. 
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight 
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. 
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire 
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. 

O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, 
Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, 
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: 
For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, 
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie 
Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, 
That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks 
Now also evidence, but straight I felt 
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt 
That I must after thee with this thy Son; 
Such fatal consequence unites us three: 
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, 
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure 
Detain from following thy illustrious track. 
Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd 
Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow'rd 
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay 
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. 
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won 
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd 
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd 
Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, 
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, 
As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World 
Retiring, by his own doom alienated, 
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide 
Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds, 
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, 
Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. 

Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. 
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, 
High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race 
Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, 
Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) 
Amply have merited of me, of all 
Th' infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore 
Triumphal with triumphal act have met, 
Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm 
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent 
Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I 
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease 
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint 
With these successes, and with them rejoyce, 
You two this way, among these numerous Orbs 
All yours, right down to Paradise descend; 
There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth 
Dominion exercise and in the Aire, 
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, 
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. 
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create 
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might 
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now 
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, 
Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. 
If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell 
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. 

So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed 
Thir course through thickest Constellations held 
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, 
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips 
Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down 
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side 
Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, 
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, 
That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, 
Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, 
And all about found desolate; for those 
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, 
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all 
Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls 
Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate 
Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, 
Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. 
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand 
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance 
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee 
Departing gave command, and they observ'd. 
As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe 
By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines 
Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes 
Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond 
The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate 
To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late 
Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell 
Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch 
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting 
Each hour their great adventurer from the search 
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, 
In shew Plebeian Angel militant 
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore 
Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible 
Ascended his high Throne, which under state 
Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end 
Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while 
He sate, and round about him saw unseen: 
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head 
And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad 
With what permissive glory since his fall 
Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd 
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng 
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, 
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: 
Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, 
Rais'd from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy 
Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand 
Silence, and with these words attention won. 

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, 
For in possession such, not onely of right, 
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd 
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth 
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit 
Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, 
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, 
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven 
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard 
With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell 
What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine 
Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep 
Of horrible confusion, over which 
By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd 
To expedite your glorious march; but I 
Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride 
Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb 
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, 
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd 
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare 
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found 
The new created World, which fame in Heav'n 
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful 
Of absolute perfection, therein Man 
Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile 
Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc'd 
From his Creator, and the more to increase 
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat 
Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up 
Both his beloved Man and all his World, 
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, 
Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, 
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man 
To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. 
True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather 
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape 
Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, 
Is enmity, which he will put between 
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; 
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: 
A World who would not purchase with a bruise, 
Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account 
Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, 
But up and enter now into full bliss. 

So having said, a while he stood, expecting 
Thir universal shout and high applause 
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears 
On all sides, from innumerable tongues 
A dismal universal hiss, the sound 
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long 
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; 
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, 
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining 
Each other, till supplanted down he fell 
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, 
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power 
Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, 
According to his doom: he would have spoke, 
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue 
To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd 
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories 
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din 
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now 
With complicated monsters head and taile, 
Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, 
Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, 
And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil 
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle 
Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, 
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun 
Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, 
Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd 
Above the rest still to retain; they all 
Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, 
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout 
Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, 
Sublime with expectation when to see 
ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; 
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd 
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, 
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, 
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, 
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, 
And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form 
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, 
As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, 
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame 
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood 
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, 
His will who reigns above, to aggravate 
Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that 
Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve 
Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange 
Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining 
For one forbidden Tree a multitude 
Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; 
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, 
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, 
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees 
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks 
That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd 
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew 
Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; 
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste 
Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay 
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit 
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste 
With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, 
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, 
With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws 
With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell 
Into the same illusion, not as Man 
Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd 
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, 
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, 
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo 
This annual humbling certain number'd days, 
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. 
However some tradition they dispers'd 
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, 
And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld 
Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- 
Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule 
Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n 
And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. 
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair 
Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, 
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell 
Habitual habitant; behind her Death 
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet 
On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. 

Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, 
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd 
With travail difficult, not better farr 
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, 
Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? 

Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. 
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, 
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, 
There best, where most with ravin I may meet; 
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems 
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. 

To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. 
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours 
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, 
No homely morsels, and whatever thing 
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, 
Till I in Man residing through the Race, 
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, 
And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 

This said, they both betook them several wayes, 
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make 
All kinds, and for destruction to mature 
Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, 
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, 
To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. 

See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance 
To waste and havoc yonder World, which I 
So fair and good created, and had still 
Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man 
Let in these wastful Furies, who impute 
Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell 
And his Adherents, that with so much ease 
I suffer them to enter and possess 
A place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem 
To gratifie my scornful Enemies, 
That laugh, as if transported with some fit 
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, 
At random yielded up to their misrule; 
And know not that I call'd and drew them thither 
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth 
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed 
On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst 
With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling 
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, 
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last 
Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell 
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. 
Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure 
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: 
Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. 

He ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud 
Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, 
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, 
Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; 
Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, 
Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom 
New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, 
Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, 
While the Creator calling forth by name 
His mightie Angels gave them several charge, 
As sorted best with present things. The Sun 
Had first his precept so to move, so shine, 
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat 
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call 
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring 
Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone 
Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five 
Thir planetarie motions and aspects 
In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, 
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne 
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt 
Thir influence malignant when to showre, 
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, 
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set 
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound 
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle 
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. 
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse 
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more 
From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd 
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun 
Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode 
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n 
Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins 
Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine 
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, 
As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change 
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring 
Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, 
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those 
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day 
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun 
To recompence his distance, in thir sight 
Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known 
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow 
From cold Estotiland, and South as farr 
Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit 
The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd 
His course intended; else how had the World 
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, 
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? 
These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd 
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, 
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, 
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North 
Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar 
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice 
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, 
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud 
And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; 
With adverse blast upturns them from the South 
Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds 
From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce 
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes 
Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, 
Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began 
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first 
Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, 
Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: 
Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, 
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, 
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe 
Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim 
Glar'd on him passing: these were from without 
The growing miseries, which Adam saw 
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, 
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, 
And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, 
Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. 

O miserable of happie! is this the end 
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late 
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom 
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face 
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth 
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end 
The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare 
My own deservings; but this will not serve; 
All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, 
Is propagated curse. O voice once heard 
Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, 
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease 
Or multiplie, but curses on my head? 
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling 
The evil on him brought by me, will curse 
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, 
For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks 
Shall be the execration; so besides 
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee 
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, 
On mee as on thir natural center light 
Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes 
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! 
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay 
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee 
From darkness to promote me, or here place 
In this delicious Garden? as my Will 
Concurd not to my being, it were but right 
And equal to reduce me to my dust, 
Desirous to resigne, and render back 
All I receav'd, unable to performe 
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold 
The good I sought not. To the loss of that, 
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added 
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable 
Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, 
I thus contest; then should have been refusd 
Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: 
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, 
Then cavil the conditions? and though God 
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son 
Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, 
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: 
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee 
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, 
But Natural necessity begot. 
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own 
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, 
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. 
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, 
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: 
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes 
His hand to execute what his Decree 
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, 
Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out 
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet 
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth 
Insensible, how glad would lay me down 
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest 
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more 
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse 
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me 
With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt 
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, 
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man 
Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish 
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, 
Or in some other dismal place who knows 
But I shall die a living Death? O thought 
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath 
Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life 
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. 
All of me then shall die: let this appease 
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. 
For though the Lord of all be infinite, 
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, 
But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise 
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? 
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make 
Strange contradiction, which to God himself 
Impossible is held, as Argument 
Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, 
For angers sake, finite to infinite 
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour 
Satisfi'd never; that were to extend 
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, 
By which all Causes else according still 
To the reception of thir matter act, 
Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say 
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, 
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie 
From this day onward, which 1 feel begun 
Both in me, and without me, and so last 
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear 
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution 
On my defensless head; both Death and I 
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, 
Nor I on my part single, in mee all 
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie 
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able 
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! 
So disinherited how would ye bless 
Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind 
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, 
If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, 
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, 
Not to do onely, but to will the same 
With me? how can they then acquitted stand 
In sight of God? Him after all Disputes 
Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain, 
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still 
But to my own conviction: first and last 
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring 
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; 
So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support 
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear 
Then all the World much heavier, though divided 
With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st 
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope 
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable 
Beyond all past example and future, 
To Satan only like both crime and doom. 
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears 
And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which 
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! 

Thus Adam to himself lamented loud 
Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, 
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air 
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, 
Which to his evil Conscience represented 
All things with double terror: On the Ground 
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft 
Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd 
Of tardie execution, since denounc't 
The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, 
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke 
To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, 
Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? 
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine 
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. 
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, 
With other echo late I taught your Shades 
To answer, and resound farr other Song. 
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, 
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, 
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: 
But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. 

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best 
Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false 
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, 
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew 
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee 
Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended 
To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee 
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride 
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, 
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd 
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen 
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening 
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting 
Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, 
To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, 
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, 
And understood not all was but a shew 
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib 
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, 
More to the part sinister from me drawn, 
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie 
To my just number found. O why did God, 
Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n 
With Spirits Masculine, create at last 
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect 
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once 
With Men as Angels without Feminine, 
Or find some other way to generate 
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, 
And more that shall befall, innumerable 
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, 
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either 
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such 
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, 
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain 
Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind 
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld 
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late 
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound 
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: 
Which infinite calamitie shall cause 
To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. 

He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve 
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, 
And tresses all disorderd, at his feet 
Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught 
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 

Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n 
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart 
I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, 
Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant 
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, 
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, 
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, 
My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, 
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? 
While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, 
Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, 
As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie 
Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, 
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not 
Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, 
On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self 
More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou 
Against God onely, I against God and thee, 
And to the place of judgment will return, 
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all 
The sentence from thy head remov'd may light 
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, 
Mee mee onely just object of his ire. 

She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, 
Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault 
Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught 
Commiseration; soon his heart relented 
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, 
Now at his feet submissive in distress, 
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, 
His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; 
As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, 
And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. 

Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, 
So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st 
The punishment all on thy self; alas, 
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine 
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, 
And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers 
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place 
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, 
That on my head all might be visited, 
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, 
To me committed and by me expos'd. 
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame 
Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive 
In offices of Love, how we may light'n 
Each others burden in our share of woe; 
Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, 
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, 
A long days dying to augment our paine, 
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. 

To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. 
Adam, by sad experiment I know 
How little weight my words with thee can finde, 
Found so erroneous, thence by just event 
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, 
Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place 
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine 
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart 
Living or dying, from thee I will not hide 
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, 
Tending to some relief of our extremes, 
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, 
As in our evils, and of easier choice. 
If care of our descent perplex us most, 
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd 
By Death at last, and miserable it is 
To be to others cause of misery, 
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring 
Into this cursed World a woful Race, 
That after wretched Life must be at last 
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power 
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent 
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. 
Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death 
Shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two 
Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. 
But if thou judge it hard and difficult, 
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain 
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, 
And with desire to languish without hope, 
Before the present object languishing 
With like desire, which would be meserie 
And torment less then none of what we dread, 
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free 
From what we fear for both, let us make short, 
Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply 
With our own hands his Office on our selves; 
Why stand we longer shivering under feares, 
That shew no end but Death, and have the power, 
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, 
Destruction with destruction to destroy. 

She ended heer, or vehement despaire 
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts 
Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. 
But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, 
To better hopes his more attentive minde 
Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. 

Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems 
To argue in thee somthing more sublime 
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; 
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes 
That excellence thought in thee, and implies, 
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret 
For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. 
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end 
Of miserie, so thinking to evade 
The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God 
Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so 
To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death 
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine 
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts 
Of contumacie will provoke the highest 
To make death in us live: Then let us seek 
Some safer resolution, which methinks 
I have in view, calling to minde with heed 
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise 
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless 
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe 
Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd 
Against us this deceit: to crush his head 
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost 
By death brought on our selves, or childless days 
Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe 
Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee 
Instead shall double ours upon our heads. 
No more be mention'd then of violence 
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, 
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely 
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, 
Reluctance against God and his just yoke 
Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild 
And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd 
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected 
Immediate dissolution, which we thought 
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee 
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, 
And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, 
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope 
Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne 
My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; 
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold 
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care 
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands 
Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; 
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear 
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, 
And teach us further by what means to shun 
Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, 
Which now the Skie with various Face begins 
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds 
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks 
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek 
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish 
Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr 
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams 
Reflected, may with matter sere foment, 
Or by collision of two bodies grinde 
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds 
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock 
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down 
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, 
And sends a comfortable heat from farr, 
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, 
And what may else be remedie or cure 
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, 
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace 
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear 
To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd 
By him with many comforts, till we end 
In dust, our final rest and native home. 
What better can we do, then to the place 
Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall 
Before him reverent, and there confess 
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears 
Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air 
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. 
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn 
From his displeasure; in whose look serene, 
When angry most he seem'd and most severe, 
What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? 

So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve 
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place 
Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell 
Before him reverent, and both confess'd 
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears 
Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air 
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.

Sonnet 12: When I do count the clock that tells the time 
William Shakespeare 
1564-1616
Renaissance
England
Love, Heartache & Loss, Realistic & Complicated



When I do count the clock that tells the time, 
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; 
When I behold the violet past prime, 
And sable curls ensilvered o'er with white; 
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, 
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, 
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves 
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: 
Then of thy beauty do I question make 
That thou among the wastes of time must go, 
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, 
And die as fast as they see others grow; 
And nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence 
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.

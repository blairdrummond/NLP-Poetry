The crowd at the ball game 
is moved uniformly 

by a spirit of uselessness 
which delights them-- 

all the exciting detail 
of the chase 

and the escape, the error 
the flash of genius-- 

all to no end save beauty 
the eternal-- 

So in detail they, the crowd, 
are beautiful 

for this 
to be warned against 

saluted and defied-- 
It is alive, venomous 

it smiles grimly 
its words cut-- 

The flashy female with her 
mother, gets it-- 

The Jew gets it straight-- it 
is deadly, terrifying-- 

It is the Inquisition, the 
Revolution 

It is beauty itself 
that lives 

day by day in them 
idly-- 

This is 
the power of their faces 

It is summer, it is the solstice 
the crowd is 

cheering, the crowd is laughing 
in detail 

permanently, seriously 
without thought

At times they will fly under. The dome
 contains jungles. Invent a sky under the dome.

 Creatures awake, asleep, at play, aglow:
 they float – unbottled genii – under the dome.

 Southern Belle, a splash of black, dusted with gold,
dissembles, assembling, acts shy under the dome.

 Cattleheart, Giant Swallowtail, Clipper:
 sail, navigate sky high under the dome.

 Like confetti – a wedding – bits of Rice
Paper: sheer mimicry under the dome.

 Magnificent Owl, in air, a pansy,
 it feeds, wings up, eye to eye, under the dome.
 
Name them: Monarch, then Queen, last Viceroy.
What will scientists deify under the dome?
 
Basking against a leaf: a Banded Orange,
displayed like a bowtie under the dome.

A living museum. Exist to be observed:
never migrate, but live, then die, under the dome.

Lips, lashes, eyes. From outside in,
do beings magnify under the dome?

Lepidoptera. From the Greek: Scale-wing.
Chrysalis. Stay, butterfly, under the dome.

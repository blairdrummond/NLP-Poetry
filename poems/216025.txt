title : Sometimes Never

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
Talking, we begin to find the way into 
our hearts, we who knew no words, 
words being a rare commodity 
in those countries we left behind. 

Both refugees and similarly deprived, 
we marvel at the many things there 
are to say: so many variations 
and colors of the same thought, so 

many different lengths in the words 
that line up together on our tongues. 
No scarcity, no rationing, no 
waiting in line in order to buy 

the same answer we heard each time 
we asked, that one word, owned by 
the state, manufactured by the state, 
serving all purposes equally alike: 
No, No, No, and sometimes Never.

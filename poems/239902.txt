title : Early Sunday Morning

author : Edward Hirsch

text : 
I used to mock my father and his chums 
 for getting up early on Sunday morning 
 and drinking coffee at a local spot 
 but now I’m one of those chumps.

 No one cares about my old humiliations 
 but they go on dragging through my sleep 
 like a string of empty tin cans rattling 
 behind an abandoned car.

 It’s like this: just when you think 
 you have forgotten that red-haired girl 
 who left you stranded in a parking lot 
 forty years ago, you wake up

 early enough to see her disappearing 
 around the corner of your dream 
 on someone else’s motorcycle 
 roaring onto the highway at sunrise.

 And so now I’m sitting in a dimly lit 
 café﻿ full of early morning risers 
 where the windows are covered with soot 
 and the coffee is warm and bitter.

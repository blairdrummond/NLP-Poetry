title : The Tunnel

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
Tonight, nothing is long enough—
 time isn’﻿t.
 Were there a fire,
 it would burn now.
  
 Were there a heaven,
 I would have gone long ago.
 I think that light
 is the final image.
  
 But time reoccurs,
 love—and an echo.
 A time passes
 love in the dark.

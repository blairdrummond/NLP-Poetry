Persona

They got me into the Sunday-school 
In Spoon River 
And tried to get me to drop Confucius for Jesus. 
I could have been no worse off 
If I had tried to get them to drop Jesus for Confucius. 
For, without any warning, as if it were a prank, 
And sneaking up behind me, Harry Wiley, 
The minister's son, caved my ribs into my lungs, 
With a blow of his fist. 
Now I shall never sleep with my ancestors in Pekin, 
And no children shall worship at my grave.

text : 
I’ve often wondered why she laughed
 On thinking why I wondered so;
 It seemed such waste that long white hands
 Should touch my hands and let them go.
  
 And once when we were parting there,
 Unseen of anything but trees,
 I touched her fingers, thoughtfully,
 For more than simple niceties.
  
 But for some futile things unsaid
 I should say all is done for us;
 Yet I have wondered how she smiled
 Beholding what was cavernous.

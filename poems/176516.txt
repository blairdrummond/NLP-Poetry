title : The Guru

Here comes the wise man in the story of sick times, 
telling you how to find the passage of satisfaction. 
He is many million years old and has been walking 
many thousand miles, more miles, more lengths of road 
than the shrunk-up earth of these days possesses, 
to find you. He has a veda from before creation 
to sing you and, lo and behold, it is about you, 
it means everything to you. Though they’ve made a rope 
out of rough, heavy smoke, like a whale-thick hawser 
for a steamer of dead star, and pulled it through you 
from throat to crotch, from ear to ear, and hag-tied 
your hands and feet with the ends, though each of them 
has your own face molten with leprosy, 
though your brain makes the sound of crowded trains 
colliding in Kashmir and a stadium that roars hosanna, 
it is still possible now, in the next moment, to know God. 
That is, not die in confusion. But maybe, then, this guru 
is too soon. Maybe he hasn’t come from far enough. 
Maybe he’s still much too young. Maybe he’s never 
asked himself clearly what happens when someone like you 
hears that a lightning-opened living fig tree or a mountain 
and a blue sky can be lived in and sets out 
on the long road never moving from his realm in pain.

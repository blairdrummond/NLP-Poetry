                                           XI
 A hundred generations, yes, a hundred and twenty-five,
 had the strength each day
 not to eat this and that (unclean!)
 not to say this and that,
 not to do this and that (unjust!),
 and with all this and all that
 to go about
 as men and Jews
 among their enemies
 (these are the Pharisees you mocked at, Jesus).
 Whatever my grandfathers did or said
 for all of their brief lives
 still was theirs,
 as all of it drops at a moment make the fountain
 and all of its leaves a palm.
 Each word they spoke and every thought
 was heard, each step and every gesture seen,
 by God;
 their past was still the present and the present
 a dread future’s.
 But I am private as an animal.
  
 I have eaten whatever I liked,
 I have slept as long as I wished,
 I have left the highway like a dog
 to run into every alley;
 now I must learn to fast and to watch.
 I shall walk better in these heavy boots
 than barefoot.
 I will fast for you, Judah,
 and be silent for you
 and wake in the night because of you;
 I will speak for you
 in psalms,
 and feast because of you
 on unleavened bread and herbs.

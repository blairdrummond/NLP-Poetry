Up stand 
             six 
yellow 
          jonquils 
in a 
       glass/ 
the stems 
               dark green, 
paling 
          as they descend   
into the water/ 
                      seen through 
a thicket 
               of baby’s breath, “a tall herb 
bearing numerous small, 
                                    fragrant white flowers.” 
I have seen 
                  snow-drops larger. 
I bent my face down. 
                               To my delight 
they were convoluted 
                               like a rose. 
They had no smell, 
                            their white 
the grain of Biblical dust, 
                                        which like the orchid itself 
is as common as hayseed. 
                                     Their stems were thin and woody   
but as tightly compacted 
                                     as a tree trunk, 
greenish rubbings showing in spots 
                                                    through the brown;   
wiry, forked twigs so close, 
                                           they made an impassable bush   
which from a distance 
                                 looked like mist. 

I could barely escape 
                                 from that wood of particulars ... 
the jonquils whose air within 
                                             was irradiated topaz,   
silent as in an ear, 
                               the stems leaning lightly   
against the glass, 
                            trisecting its inner circle   
in the water, 
                     crossed like reverent hands   
(ah, the imagination! 
                                 Benedicite.   
Enter monks. 
                   Oops, sorry! 
Trespassing 
                  on Japanese space.   
Exit monks 
                and all their lore   
from grace). 

I was moved by all this 
                                    and murmured   
to my eyes, “Oh, Master!” 
                                       and became engrossed again   
in that wood of particulars 
                                          until I found myself   
out of character, singing 
         “Tell me why you’ve settled here.” 

         “Because my element is near.” 
and reflecting, 
                        “The eye of man cares. Yes!” 

But a familiar voice 
                               broke into the wood,   
a shade of mockery in it, 
                                       and in her smile   
a fore-knowledge 
                         of something playful,   
something forbidden, 
                               something make-believe 
something saucy, 
                         something delicious   
about to pull me 
                         off guard: 
“Do you want to be my Cupid-o?” 

In fairness to her 
                            it must be said 
that her freckles 
                           are always friendly   
and that the anticipation 
                                       of a prank   
makes them radiate 
                            across her face   
the way dandelions 
                            sprout in a field   
after a summer shower. 

“What makes you so fresh, 
                                       my Wife of Bath?   
What makes you so silly, 
                                     o bright hen?” 

“That’s for you to find out, 
                                           old shoe, old shoe.   
That’s for you to find out 
                                        if you can.” 

“Oh yeah!” 
                (a mock chase and capture).   
“Commit her 
                  into jonquil’s custody.   
She’ll see a phallus 
                               in the pistil. 
Let her work it off there.” 

But I was now myself 
                                  under this stringent force   
which ended, 
                   as real pastorals in time must, 
in bed, with the great 
                                  eye of man, rolling.

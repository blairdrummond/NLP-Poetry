text : 
Boston, 1973—Years had passed and I assumed a 
Different life when one night, while resting from 
Books on Marlborough Street (where things like 
This can happen), there came into my room images

In black-and-white with a flow of light that 
Would not die. It all came back to me in different 
Terms: characters were born again, met up with 
Each other in adult life, drifted across the

Screen to discover cattle and oil, traveled miles 
On horseback in dust and heat, characters whose 
Names emerged as if they mattered in a history 
Book. Some were swept up by power and prejudice

Toward neighbors different from themselves, 
Because that is what the picture is about, with 
Class distinctions moving the plot along. A few 
Could distinguish right from wrong; those who

Could not you condemned from the beginning when 
You noticed them at all. Still others married or 
Backed off from the ranch with poignant flair, 
Like James Dean, who in the middle of grazing land

Unearthed the treasures of oil, buried his soul in 
Money and went incoherent with alcohol. When the 40's 
Came, two young men were drafted, the one called Angel 
Dying at war. It's a generational tale, so everybody

Aged once more and said what they had to say along the 
Way according to the script. And then the end: the 
Hamburger joint brought into existence to the beat of 
"The Yellow Rose of Texas," Juana and her child the

Color of dark amber, foreshadowing the Mexican-looking 
Couple and their daughter, all in muteness, wanting 
To be served. I climbed out of bed and in my head 
Was a roaring of light—words spoken and unspoken

Had brought the obliterated back. Not again (I said, 
From my second-floor room)...let this not be happening. 
Three and-a-half hours had flicked by. As the sound 
Trailed off into nothing, memory would not dissolve.

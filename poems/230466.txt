The extraordinary patience of things! 
This beautiful place defaced with a crop of suburban houses— 
How beautiful when we first beheld it, 
Unbroken field of poppy and lupin walled with clean cliffs;   
No intrusion but two or three horses pasturing, 
Or a few milch cows rubbing their flanks on the outcrop rock-heads— 
Now the spoiler has come: does it care? 
Not faintly. It has all time. It knows the people are a tide   
That swells and in time will ebb, and all 
Their works dissolve. Meanwhile the image of the pristine beauty   
Lives in the very grain of the granite, 
Safe as the endless ocean that climbs our cliff.—As for us:   
We must uncenter our minds from ourselves; 
We must unhumanize our views a little, and become confident 
As the rock and ocean that we were made from.

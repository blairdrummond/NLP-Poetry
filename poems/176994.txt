title : Dream Song 14

author : John Berryman

text : 
Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.   
After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,   
we ourselves flash and yearn, 
and moreover my mother told me as a boy   
(repeatingly) ‘Ever to confess you’re bored   
means you have no 

Inner Resources.’ I conclude now I have no   
inner resources, because I am heavy bored. 
Peoples bore me, 
literature bores me, especially great literature,   
Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes   
as bad as achilles, 

who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.   
And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag   
and somehow a dog 
has taken itself & its tail considerably away 
into mountains or sea or sky, leaving            
behind: me, wag.

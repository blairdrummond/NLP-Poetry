title : Explication of an Imaginary Text

author : James Galvin

text : 
Salt is pity, brooms are fury, 
The waterclock stands for primordial harmony. 

The spruce forest, which is said to be 
Like a cathedral 
Indicates proliferation of desire. 

The real meaning of the beginning 
Will not become clear until later, if ever. 

Things no longer being what they were, 
Artifice poses as process, 
The voice is tinged with melancholy. 

The teacup, the brass knuckles, and the pearl-handled razor 
Resist interpretation 

As if to say 
That half the wind is in the mind 
And half in the mind of the wind. 

Speaking through the character 
Who comes to faith on his deathbed, 

The author makes apology 
For saying things he didnâ€™t mean. 
Little girl-cousins with ribbons in their hair 

Confuse him with their names and are carried away 
By laughter. Thus, 

The force of love comes from belief, 
Hate is from lack of doubt. 
Paradox by paradox the narrative proceeds 

Until half the stars are absolute tears. 
The other half are mirrors.

Potuia, potuia   
White grave goddess,   
Pity my sadness,   
O silence of Paros. 

I am not of these about thy feet,   
These garments and decorum;   
I am thy brother,   
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,   
And thou hearest me not. 

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes   
Of our loves in Phrygia,   
The far ecstasy of burning noons   
When the fragile pipes   
Ceased in the cypress shade,   
And the brown fingers of the shepherd   
Moved over slim shoulders;   
And only the cicada sang. 

I have told thee of the hills 
And the lisp of reeds 
And the sun upon thy breasts, 

And thou hearest me not,   
Potuia, potuia 
Thou hearest me not.

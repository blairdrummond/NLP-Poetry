title : Eve Considers the Possibility of Pardon

author : John Engels

text : 
In one dream I am made watchful. 
In this dream the name we never clearly have heard   
is spoken, which name, if we knew 

and could speak it, would call back to us   
those whom in time we will have come to love   
and who will die; would bring them back to us 

like us abandoned again 
to his terrible consequence,   
the silence between us 

forever affirmed. And in whatever   
might constitute the pardon   
would come down in a fragile rain 

the whole matter of all 
we will ever love, the whole 
fiery blade of space, ten billions of suns 

suddenly blossoming small and cool   
as snowdrops over the opening graves,   
the world shimmering with the blue 

delicate membrane of the fallen sky, 
while above us the forsaken voice calls out   
come back come back 

as if calling the name 
each of us had long forgotten 
until that very instant not remembered 

as proper to our hearts.

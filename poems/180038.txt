title : Snip Your Hair

author : Regina DeSalva

text : 
I’ll snip your hair   
Cut it all off until you look like a man   
I will replace your weight loss bars with bars to make you gain   
I will cut your credit cards in half   
I will shrink all your clothes   
Every trick in the book I will try   
I will give all your shoes to the dog   
I will do it all   
Crazy is where you will be driven   
Off a cliff you will want to jump   
Then when I am all done   
I will look at you with big doughy eyes   
And I will say I am sorry   
But I have my fingers crossed

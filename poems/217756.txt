title : The Sun

author : Dan Chiasson

text : 
There is one mind in all of us, one soul, 
    who parches the soil in some nations 

but in others hides perpetually behind a veil; 
    he spills light everywhere, here he spilled 

some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended. 
    He is in charge of darkness also, also 

in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination. 
    People fucking do so by flicking him 

off and on, off and on, with their eyelids 
    as they ascertain their love's sincerity. 

He makes the stars disappear, but he makes 
    small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars, 

in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes 
    of sighing lovers bored with one another. 

Onto the surface of the world he stamps 
    all plants and animals. They are not gods 

but it is he who made us worshippers of every   
    bramble toad, black chive we find. 

In Idaho there is a desert cricket that makes 
    a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he 

is not a god. The only god is the sun, 
    our mind, master of all crickets and clocks.

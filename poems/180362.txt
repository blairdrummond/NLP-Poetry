title : Drowning in Wheat

author : John Kinsella

text : 
They’d been warned 
on every farm 
that playing 
in the silos 
would lead to death. 
You sink in wheat. 
Slowly. And the more 
you struggle the worse it gets. 
‘You’ll see a rat sail past 
your face, nimble on its turf, 
and then you’ll disappear.’ 
In there, hard work 
has no reward. 
So it became a kind of test 
to see how far they could sink 
without needing a rope 
to help them out. 
But in the midst of play 
rituals miss a beat—like both 
leaping in to resolve 
an argument 
as to who’d go first 
and forgetting 
to attach the rope. 
Up to the waist 
and afraid to move. 
That even a call for help 
would see the wheat 
trickle down. 
The painful consolidation 
of time. The grains 
in the hourglass 
grotesquely swollen. 
And that acrid 
chemical smell 
of treated wheat 
coaxing them into 
a near-dead sleep.

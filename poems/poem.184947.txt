Sonnet

I have no Brother,a??they who meet me now
Offer a hand with their own wills defiled,
And, while they wear a smooth unwrinkled brow,
Know not that Truth can never be beguiled;
Go wash the hand that still betrays thy guilt;
Before the spirita??s gaze what stain can hide?
Abela??s red blood upon the earth is spilt,
And by thy tongue it cannot be denied;
I hear not with my ear,a??the heart doth tell
Its secret deeds to me untold before;
Go, all its hidden plunder quickly sell,
Then shalt thou cleanse thee from thy brothera??s gore,
Then will I take thy gift; that bloody stain
Shall not be seen upon thy hand again.

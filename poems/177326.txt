Bottles on the closet floor,   
       bottles underneath the bed. 
               Of course he thinks he’s caused 

it all. The hiding places   
       unimaginative, the vodka’s 
               glass sides clear when empty, 

clear when full, like the cellophane   
       -transparent plastic skin 
               of the model he glued together 

thirty years ago, The Visible   
       Man, the tiny organs in 
               “authentic colors,” kelly green lungs 

and scarlet heart. But he’s trying, 
       as they say, to reside in the moment,   
               stuffing the duffel bag 

to bring her where she’s trembling 
       on the ward, where she’s hating both    
               herself and him, passing four 

locked doors to reach her, as if each   
       were some frontier checkpoint   
               to a country even farther 

distant than the one he’s trapped 
       in now. The zebra-striped gate, 
               the guards who hold his documents 

against the light, peering through 
       the watermarks and faded passport stamps.   
               And he knows his skin is glass, 

his mission shame, and shame 
       the lingua franca of these lands,   
               the sign language of fingers 

unzipping compartments 
       with a nylon hiss, to probe 
               her sweaters, jeans, and stockings, 

(the toothpaste tube uncapped 
       and sniffed) and shame the notebook   
               and the novels he’s brought her, 

riffled and shut with a strange 
       and final delicacy, and shame 
               the signal that motions him on.

title : Connubial

author : Stephen Dunn

text : 
Because with alarming accuracy   
she’d been identifying patterns   
I was unaware of—this tic, that   
tendency, like the way I’ve mastered   
the language of intimacy   
in order to conceal how I felt—   

I knew I was in danger   
of being terribly understood.

title : My New Job

I am      Invested in
 by a      Huge Fund
 Heavy                    highquality
 furniture
 Sense of heavy
 Addiction glossy pleasance
  
 I was lying  Down on a yoga mat
  My bones
 basketing air     Barely draped in 
 skin
 the basket             Effulged by local
 Air      Highquality        scented
 humid air
 to support          My orchid        Skin
  
 Suffuged in this Air
 expense I nearly
 floated  Who was my  Body
  
 I am comfortable I am
 comfortable     Flying my spirit
  
 On a long leash
 She is            in the wind
    I am in the     belle
 belle jar
 shellacked and        brittle
   begins to      ding
  
  
 How can I      From inside this comfort
  
 Represent      Hope to
  
 No no
  
 I am                 Too tempted
  
 To think I            Deserve it
                      Rigidly and with effort
  
 know my privilege
  
  
  
 I know my fluorescent doorway
  
 A rectangle   Among the ceiling tiles
  
 Ordinary flecked coated  1) foam rectangles
  
 and one hard white light regularly rubbled
  2) glass rectangle
  
 these are my choices
 the
  
      ceiling tile                      I would tear
 in                         behind the
        Ugly lattice to the   Duct area
    Unscrew the grille    Smallen myself
 Into the dark cold  Square pipe
     To share  My cold  What is in
        My basket    Bone-basket
               With the other      breathers/Workers
  
 Or through the fluorescent door
  
  Means giving up   On going   behind
 the lattice.
  
  
 All that’s allowed   Through the flow light
  
 Is what   Is shined upon
  
 The light bends looking at my   Skin
 and hair   and   green blouse
  
        When I concentrate  The light bending
 All at once         Hooks my outsides
  
 Hooks them into itself
  
              Now I am 
      absent that
  
 I am not / shined upon
  
      very small        dusty
  
      lizardlike   a  toad    a  turd
  
    on a tabletop     corner

 And the outside of that is hooked away
  
          wow my parents
  
 hooked away           People
  
 on the street   skin and clothing
  
     hung on hangers
  
  from    electric wires
  
 blooming and twisting    swells of breeze
  
 leave behind             on the street
 a fair       weather
  
 an easy            weather
 walk-through
  
  
 I think I’m better    than the walk-throughs
     because something is left of me
  
 that’s what I     think I must
   be wrong to     think so
  
  
  
                Would you like to    Eat at my house
  
 Fill up your              Walk-through
  
 You drive through               Fill it up with
  
 tea and sheets
   water from the toilet
  
 These could    be your eyebrows
                                        [crayons]
  
 these could be your knees, these coasters
  
                   What could                be your inside?
  
    Paper       wadded paper
       It says something
  
 What about              Something sticky
        For your mouth             Honey
  
 Then we will read you      For dinner
  
  
  
 In my  transitional housing    [dirt ball toad]
  
    I picked myself apart   With a fork
   Connected a wire      Where my belly was
                                          Coiled up   the plug
            The prongs poke hurt
  
 This is the part        Light plugs
         into           My/The outside plugs
 into             To light up
  
 The    shine    is    from    unshiny
  
  
  sewn in place with the little
      Light hooks     Made a case for me
 Visible
  
  
    so I retaliated
 Against the hooks
  
 I was    trying       My lizard turd
    was trying    to    join the other
  
 Mud
  
  
 my thrashing         harnessed
 motored
 made the light
  
  
  
 Meanwhile       My toad
 absorbed
 pollution
  
 from the walkthroughs       High empty
 thoughts      Funneled   backchannel
  
 Won’t you be mine [mind]         Be my thought
 softening                   the rockmud
  
  
  
 I will reorient  now          I will claymation
 That is a scary    Gingerbready
  
  
     mud man
  walking          You can’t catch me       hole for
                         Your thoughts
    tunneled invisible     Unreflecting
 unrepresenter
 Not wrapped
  
  
  
 The Sun is here    Also   later and at
   the same time   the sun burned
     up and we revolved
   
 around it dirt rock
  
     warm   dirt rock
   
     in the dark                     of coursing
     around the dark
  
 I have made myself the center of
  
      the galaxy
 I am very important to myself
  
  must lose this
  
 visibility
  
 The shine is off
  
 perspect while kicking
  

 Where do you      think they get the lights from?
   
    Burn it up, burn up all the fuel
 into furious dirt
  
      Nematodes
 don’t need light
  
 When I am in a room with forest
 It is not that myself comes home to myself
  
    Selva oscura,  ya
  
     Obsecurity of self
  
      I considered long and seriously before
  
            I was bornt
  
      I stood on the street
  
    With the hookers
  
 Who were selling
  
 Disappear into a hole
  
 Into Mama
  
     but come back out.
  
    Go in, boys.
  
   Go in and stay there.

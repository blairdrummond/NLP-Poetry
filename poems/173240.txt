title : Fragment 10: The Three Sorts of Friends

author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge

text : 
Though friendships differ endless in degree , 
The sorts , methinks, may be reduced to three. 
Ac quaintance many, and Con quaintance few; 
But for In quaintance I know only twoâ€” 
The friend I've mourned with, and the maid I woo!

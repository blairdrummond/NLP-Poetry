text : 
Before the break of day the minister was awakened 
by the sound of hatchets 
breaking open the door and windows. 
He ran towards the door: 
about twenty Indians with painted faces 
were coming into the house 
howling. 

Three Indians took hold of him, 
and bound him as he stood in his night-shirt, 
and began to rifle the house going into every room. 
As he lay, bound and helpless, he thought of his wife and 
    children— 
his wife had given birth only a few weeks before— 
and he remembered the passage in Isaiah: 
“I shall go to the gates of the grave 
deprived of the rest of my years. . .” 

The Indians had taken two of his children to the door 
and killed them, 
as well as the Negro woman 
who helped take care of them; 
keeping him bound with the cord about one arm, 
they let him put on his clothes with the other; 
and let his wife dress herself, too, 
as well as their children left alive. 

When the sun was an hour high 
all were led out of the house 
for the journey of three hundred miles to Quebec— 
snow up to their knees. 
Many of the houses were now on fire; 
and, as they left the town, 
he saw his house and barn burning. 

At first the minister was not allowed to speak to any of his 
    fellow captives 
as they marched, 
but on the second day he had another Indian to watch him 
and was allowed to speak with his wife when he overtook her 
and could walk with her and help her along. 
She told him that she was losing her strength 
and they must expect to part 
and she hoped that God would keep him alive and their children 
    still among the living— 
but not a word of complaint 
saying that it was the will of God. 

When they came to a small river 
the captives had to wade it; 
the water knee-deep 
and the current swift. 
After that they had to climb a hill, 
almost a mountain, 
and the minister’s strength was almost gone when he came to   
    the top; 
but he was not allowed to sit down 
and even unburdened of his pack. 

He begged the Indian in charge of him 
to let him go down and help his wife 
but the man would not let him; 
and he asked each of the captives as they passed 
about her; 
and heard at last that in going through the river 
she fell 
and plunged headfirst into the water; 
and, after that, at the foot of the hill 
the Indian who held her captive 
killed her 
with one stroke of his hatchet 
and left the body   
as meat for the fowls and beasts.

text : 
Catullus is my master and I mix   
a little acid and a bit of honey   
      in his bowl love 

is my subject & the lack of love   
which lack is what makes evil a   
      poet must strike 

Catullus could rub words so hard   
together their friction burned a   
      heat that warms 

us now 2000 years away I roll the   
words around my mouth & count the   
      letters in each 

line thus eye and ear contend in- 
side the poem and draw its move- 
      ment tight Milton 

thought rhyme was vulgar I agree   
yet sometimes if it’s hidden in   
      the line a rhyme 

will richen tone the thing I most   
despise is quote poetic unquote   
      diction I prefer 

to build with plain brown bricks 
of common talk American talk then   
      set 1 Roman stone 

among them for a key I know Ca- 
tullus knew a poem is like a blow   
      an impact strik- 

ing where you least expect this I   
believe and yet with me a poem   
      is finally just 
      a natural thing.

title : The Deathwatch Beetle

1. 
A cardinal hurls itself 
at my window all morning long,   
trying so hard to penetrate 
its own reflection 
I almost let it in myself, 
though once I saw   
another red bird, crazed 
by the walls of a room,   
spatter its feathers   
all over the house. 


2. 
My whole childhood is coming apart,   
the last stitches 
about to be ripped out 
with your death, 
and I will be left—ridiculous, 
to write 
condolence letters 
to myself. 


3. 
The deathwatch beetle 
earned its name 
not from its ugliness 
or our terror 
of insects 
but simply because of the sound   
it makes, ticking. 


4. 
When your spirit 
perfects itself, 
will it escape 
out of a nostril, 
or through the spiral 
passage of an ear? 
Or is it even now battering   
against your thin skull, wild   
to get through, blood brother   
to this crimson bird?

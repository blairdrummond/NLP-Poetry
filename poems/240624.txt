text : 
My name mocks me
 for I was born at the cost
 of my mother’s life,
 earning my father’s hatred
 with my first breath.
 All my life
 I have scoured a house soiled
 with the thick soot of his resentment.
 It has left its mark on the walls,
 in his eyes, and on me.
 All of it I have tried to wipe away.
 In my hands I hold a broom,
 in my heart—
 ashes, ashes.

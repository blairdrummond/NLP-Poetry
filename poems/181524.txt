title : Hunger for Something

author : Chase Twichell

text : 
Sometimes I long to be in the woodpile, 
cut-apart trees soon to be smoke, 
or even the smoke itself, 

sinewy ghost of ash and air, going 
wherever I want to, at least for a while. 

Neither inside nor out, 
neither lost nor home, no longer 
a shape or a name, I’d pass through 

all the broken windows of the world. 
It’s not a wish for consciousness to end. 

It’s not the appetite an army has 
for its own emptying heart, 
but a hunger to stand now and then 

alone on the death-grounds, 
where the dogs of the self are feeding.

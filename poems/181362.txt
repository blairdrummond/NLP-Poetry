title : Vestibule

author : Chase Twichell

text : 
What etiquette holds us back 
from more intimate speech, 
especially now, at the end of the world? 
Can’t we begin a conversation 
here in the vestibule, 
then gradually move it inside? 
What holds us back 
from saying things outright? 
We’ve killed the earth. 
Yet we speak of other things. 
Our words should cauterize 
all wounds to the truth.

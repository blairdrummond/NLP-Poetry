title : We were Two Rooms of One Timber, But I Left that Place Alone

author : Camille T. Dungy

Sara, widow, 31
Henry pulled our heartwood along the rutted street   
that town stood beside, built two rooms   
and called them home.   My Henry did that.   
There.   And I lived all those days inside his love.   

But there is a kind of hunger that feeds   
on flesh.   Only, let it be yearning, heaving,   
rising flesh.   Only, let it be flesh living   
and loving.   Alive.   Let it be life.   

There is a kind of hunger that feeds on life.   
They carved into him with banquet knives,   
made stew of his skin and stirred it   
with his own bones.   My Henry served: the meat   
and the pot to cook it in.   And there was no charge   
against the men who made that meal.

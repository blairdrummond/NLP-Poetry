title : He was touched or he touched or

author : Marianne Boruch

text : 
He was touched or he touched or   
she did and was, or they were   
and would. Or the room could, its   
three doors, two windows or   

the house on a slant touching,   
touched by the drift down street, cars   
pressing quick or slowing. All along   
the town touched a river, the river   

the filth falling through it. What was clean—   
a source pure as rumor—a shore   
touching lake touched by wind above,   
and below, a spring. All touch blindly 

further water. That blue touching   
blacker regions in the sea so weirdly   
solitary, each to under, to every   
sideways past deeper, where nowhere.

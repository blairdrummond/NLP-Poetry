title : On Inhabiting an Orange

author : Josephine Miles

text : 
All our roads go nowhere.
Maps are curled
To keep the pavement definitely 
On the world.

All our footsteps, set to make 
Metric advance,
Lapse into arcs in deference 
To circumstance.

All our journeys nearing Space 
Skirt it with care,
Shying at the distances
Present in air.

Blithely travel-stained and worn, 
Erect and sure,
All our travels go forth,
Making down the roads of Earth 
Endless detour.

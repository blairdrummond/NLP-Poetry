title : Careless Perfection

author : Daniel Halpern

text : 
According to Lin Yutang,
 both Po Chuyi and Su Tungpo
 "desperately admired" Tao Yuanming,

 a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem,
 a poem thought by Chinese dilettantes to be
 the one "blemish in a white jade."

 Can a poet be faulted for calling a woman
 carelessly perfect in beauty?
 He chose to long for her by envying

 the candle that glowed upon her
 beautiful face, the shadow
 that followed in her every move.

 Yet the nature poet Tao Yuanming, at home
 with the sudden turning of seasons,
 now feared the shadow in darkness,

 a discarded fan that once stirred her hair,
 feared the candle at dawn. At last believed
 that for beauty he had lived in vain.

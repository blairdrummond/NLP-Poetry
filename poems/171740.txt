title : How Things Work

Today it’s going to cost us twenty dollars 
To live. Five for a softball. Four for a book,
A handful of ones for coffee and two sweet rolls, 
Bus fare, rosin for your mother’s violin. 
We’re completing our task. The tip I left 
For the waitress filters down
Like rain, wetting the new roots of a child 
Perhaps, a belligerent cat that won’t let go 
Of a balled sock until there’s chicken to eat.
As far as I can tell, daughter, it works like this: 
You buy bread from a grocery, a bag of apples 
From a fruit stand, and what coins
Are passed on helps others buy pencils, glue, 
Tickets to a movie in which laughter 
Is thrown into their faces.
If we buy a goldfish, someone tries on a hat.
If we buy crayons, someone walks home with a broom. 
A tip, a small purchase here and there, 
And things just keep going. I guess.

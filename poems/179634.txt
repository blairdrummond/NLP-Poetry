title : Visitation

text : 
Walking past the open window, she is surprised 
by the song of the white-throated sparrow 
and stops to listen. She has been thinking of 
the dead ones she loves--her father who lived 
over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone 
at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking 
she has called them back, that they are calling her 
in the voices of these birds passing through Ohio 
on their spring migration. . . because, after years 
of summers in upstate New York, the white-throat 
has become something like the family bird. 
Her father used to stop whatever he was doing 
and point out its clear, whistling song. She hears it 
again: "Poor Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody." 
She tries not to think, "Poor Andy," but she 
has already thought it, and now she is weeping. 
But then she hears another, so clear, it's as if 
the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, 
telling her that everything will be all right. 
She cannot see them from her second-story window-- 
they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, 
or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- 
but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay 
for only a few days before moving on.

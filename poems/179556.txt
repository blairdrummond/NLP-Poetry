title : Summer Downpour on Campus

author : Juliana Gray

text : 
When clouds turn heavy, rich 
and mottled as an oyster bed, 

when the temperature drops so fast 
that fog conjures itself inside the cars, 
as if the parking lots were filled 
with row upon row of lovers, 

when my umbrella veils my face 
and threatens to reverse itself 
at every gust of wind, and rain 
lashes my legs and the hem of my skirt, 

but I am walking to meet a man 
who’ll buy me coffee and kiss my fingers— 

what can be more beautiful, then, 
than these boys sprinting through the storm, 
laughing, shouldering the rain aside, 
running to their dorms, perhaps to class, 
carrying, like torches, their useless shoes?

I Was Made Erect and Lone

I was made erect and lone, 
And within me is the bone; 
Still my vision will be clear, 
Still my life will not be drear, 
To the center all is near. 
Where I sit there is my throne. 
If age choose to sit apart, 
If age choose, give me the start, 
Take the sap and leave the heart.

 Tripartite schemes were all very well
 for the builders who held their blueprints firmly
 in hand beforehand. What did it matter
 if the two vertical poles didn’t touch, seemed so
 far apart, in fact, that no one who visited the site
 could believe the architect’s arrogant babble?
 Before they knew it, he’d bridged the two poles with a plank.
  
 I have hidden under these structures of
 synthetic comfort when the sky was
 overcast. I have even hired a claque of
 unemployed actors  to stand there with me. But speaking
 for myself, I find their tentlike charm diminishing.
 Over on the next hill is a line of poker-faced upright slabs,
 their bases deep in the dirt, their function something else entirely.
  
  
     II.
  
 I keep seeking this pleasure-giving eye mote;
 you fill your pew and my view with
 golden uncontrollable emanation
 and the music surges in response,
 a coded story of hope and disappointment
 decipherable to the few. Is it wrong
 to be overheated here, or not to have left my coat at the entrance?
  
 The only crime would be not to swoon,
 to see and ignore you, or brand you a brother
 in spotless devotion. Beneath the bleeding windows
 hearts must have heft, masses of skin become
 human tremors, to feel the force of the organ.
 On its own the rite is a starchy obligation;
 add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples.
  
  
     III.
  
 Over the hub of the hill, a solid wall of
 silver leaves. Underfoot, soil without
 burrows. Blanketing soil and leaves, a scrim of
 hushed and unpunctured blue. Then all of a sudden,
 rumors of something about to happen; the night
 restless with its own unkeepable secrets,
 the very air strained and achingly electric.
  
 Because you are not here, nighttime behaves
 this way, calling for terms I’d long since put away:
 susurration, intrigue, reverberant. It is only
 in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings
 can sing your praises so; I curse even as I gape
 to know that their raving requires your being
 anywhere else. The evening hums in compensation.
  
  
     IV.
  
 His beak is open as if in mid-worm or
 mid-sentence, his feet impressively sturdy as they
 straddle the street. What gives him away,
 though, is the magenta pool spreading rapidly
 under this otherwise unruffled stomach.
 Something ended this bird so suddenly that
 he never had time to strike a normal death pose.
  
 It would be overdone and untrue
 to say I am the bird, to paint myself in similar terms
 as stunted, irretrievably downed, forever rooted
 to unkind ground. It would smack of self-pity.
 We are partners instead beneath a general rubric
 of doom: an arrow descended and brought 
 him, startled, to death, me screamingly to life.
  
  
     V.
  
 I loved a statue and watered it daily.
 Sooner or later it softened and let me
 break a vital part of it off;
 with my hard-won prize in my pocket
 I explored the streets with a secret,
 but before long the plundered piece was 
 dust in my hands, and painful to look at.
  
 Now another effigy makes me
 shudder at its criminal threshold.
 More than ever I entertain a 
 shameless urge to steal or caress it,
 but the facts of history tell me
 otherwise: you get what you pray for
 and the statue dwindles to rubble.
  
  
     VI.
  
 Although others lack the sharpened knives
 to be villains, they do what they can with 
 blunter instruments. Sparring to kill time, 
 falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them,
 they get their day’s entertainment from
 instruction manuals bought at auctions; when one
 utters his bored “Touché,” a gaggle of fans surround him.
  
 How much deadlier is your collection of
 swords with a history, scimitars that glint
 even when strung up and inactive. Although I would gladly
 lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of
 thrust-and-parry, you have no need of
 anything resembling aid: one twist of your weapon
 outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers.
  
  
     VII.
  
 The avuncular figure with grizzled beard,
 the bearer of balm for the stricken and
 abandoned, the craggy but spirited sickle-carrier
 paces the page of a long-forgotten book of days
 and never once frowns. There is no need to:
 our days may be numbered, but . . . (and here his eyes
 mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows).
  
 His evil twin wants none of this waiting,
 this starry-eyed torpor. Hoping to scare eternity
 into submission, he too brandishes a sickle, but
 everything goes wrong: he pierces his own leg and must go
 on crutches. Before long, he falls into childish fits
 of self-pity, proffering sickle and leg to hirelings,
 saying “Lop it off, boys, and be quick.”
  
  
     VIII.
  
 During the first stages of frenzy, a glut of
 meaning descends on nature. As if to spite cynics
 who call dirt nothing but dirt, terrific breezes
 mere conveyors of pollen, something in the 
 sufferer’s mind seeks out and finds corroboration
 in vast planets and puny insects; all are as prone to 
 nervous tics, all whirring with badly kept secrets.
  
 Time passes, and the system turn on you. When
 all is sacred, nothing is safe: silent lampposts suddenly
 pipe up in irresistible  colloquy a tone too high, the sky
 calls you but does not want your replies, and
 water-bound birds decline pronouns in Latin. It is a hotbed
 that cannot stand the addition of an offending
 presence; it whispers until you are well on your way.
  
  
     IX.
  
 Before you came on the scene and blasted
 the image to bits, I thought of love as a 
 spacious courtroom where evidence was presented
 graphically and up front, where deserving plaintiffs
 got what they wanted legally, and where
 judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw
 happy verdicts amicably arrived at.
  
 These days, law is something to be left at the door
 along with galoshes; I spend my nights in sinister
 mock-trial, playing all the parts. “Guilty or not?”
 booms our pot-bellied, exquisitely bored judge. I answer
 for you: “Not, your holiness; this harridan framed me.”
 And then I object. And then, hunched over in a corner
 of the courtroom, a juror suggests we all go out to lunch.
  
  
     X.
  
 It was a run of the mill journey until the windows
 seemed to have melted; outside the train,
 the foliage of early summer received an
 instantaneous drenching. Startled, I thought of you
 like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance:
 “Holding her heart, agawp at nature’s rages,
 she would watch the storm from inside, and secretly like it.”
  
 No longer dainty hand-to-the-head, the tragic
 meaningful stare out the window. No storm buffets
 alone; however stunningly leaves may shudder and
 press against the pane, it is a wasted downpour if
 nobody comes out soggy. Reaching my stop, I
 left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker
 and headed for the wet jungle, hot on your heels.
  
  
     XI.
  
 Our meeting is as stiff as a long-dead thoroughbred.
 Like its former coat, we too are glossy and brief;
 no frizzy wire springs up that is not
 dutifully cropped; our every neigh is strictly
 by the book; place us in a lineup of 
 similarly frozen stallions, and you will not know
 one rigor mortis from another and another. 
  
 I could endure a salvo of kicking, a brutish uprearing
 nag, or a vicious race to the finish, over this
 wingless duo of moribund mares. I could even
 stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes
 in my horse metaphor. Anything other than the way
 our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth:
 gorgeous stillborns, cynical has-beens. This is no time for pleasantry!
  
  
     XII.
  
 I have been dreaming you into the picture
 when you bound, unseeing, past me. I tingle
 onward with knees of jelly, glad
 to be confirmed in my scheming: this walk
 is no hopeless ramble, but a perfect way
 of seeing and being seen. Fate, sensing
 my hopes, obligingly guides you outdoors.
  
 What rankles is the time it takes me
 to realize that you are truly, tangibly here.
 I have been holding so many secret meetings with you
 that this brief encounter, this perfect opportunity
 passes, doesn’t register. I see you in retrospect:
 you were here, jacket flapping in the noon breeze,
 and gone by the time I had presence of mind to grasp it.
  
  
     XIII.
  
 Explaining camouflage: a useful way 
 of suiting yourself to your habitat so that
 you steal its features more than it steals yours; in war,
 a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes;
 in love, a vanishing act that lets you watch the object
 of your affection, in whose vagrant eyes
 you might as well be a pebble, a flaw on the leaf.
  
 Or, a ruinous self-effacement, brainchild
 of the timid, deserving to be trounced
 by the rustle in the trees which announces
 a vital presence, the force which, storming a fortress,
 subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most
 cherished beliefs, the stunning hybrid
 you look at once and cannot get out of your mind.
  
  
     XIV.
  
 Hearing you praised is enough to make my
 overbaked brain a warpath for feuding
 goddesses. Only instead of swords,
 their messages clash, each one a model of
 what I might do. On one side, Silence,
 stately in black, shows no sign of unrest:
 her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod.
  
 On the other side in see-through red, a goddess
 named Outrage deafens her rival with laudatory
 overdrive; next to her encomia both clean
 and unclean, the excesses of the laurel-throwers
 positively began to pale. It is her manner that 
 somehow filters out; the walls start to rumble, the floorboards,
 feeble at keeping secrets, murmur “Swear it.”
  
  
     XV.
  
 In the handed-down inventory of love’s habits
 we find images of lowering: down at the mouth,
 down on the knees, prostrate with the shock of the marvelous.
 Contact more than shame-faced with the elevated figure
 is therefore impossible; hazard more
 than a bow, and a trapdoor opens beneath you;
 offer a hand, and see love disappear.
  
 There is never a mention of the sudden boost
 the run-down ego receives when, flinging a jest
 from toad-high levels, it witnesses more than
 haughty approval. Nor is it told how the jest
 (some minor impromptu line) gets told and retold
 in the prolonged wake of the moment; seraphs laugh at it,
 trees love it; you see your dullness shine in another’s eyes.
  
  
     XVI.
  
 A dream straight out of a textbook: having been
 tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy, hairy-
 faced thug and her henchman, I hear the incredible shouts
 as an old babysitter is disemboweled.
 Severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes,
 but I do not think, “Me next,” fearing instead
 that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess.
  
 What can I do, on waking, but clench my stomach
 in sharp, instinctive need to keep it closed?
 In wars between the hirsute and the nurturing, nobody
 dares to cheer for the former, though her company, being
 moody, is hellishly more alive. Will this day or
 the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of
 spilling over? (Somewhere the babysitter screams your name.)
  
  
     XVII.
  
 Once a day, you report to the resident loony
 for clues leading to the whereabouts of
 the author of a love letter you have received.
 She is mad but useful, delving as she can into
 alternate worlds; and as you grill her from the other 
 side of the bars, a strange bond begins to form
 between you. She seems to have felt as you do.
  
 Little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless
 self-promoter. She ladles out counsel (“You can tell
 she wants to be tracked down”) and misinformation
 (“I think I know where she lives”) like a watery broth
 that keeps you coming back for the meaty pay-off
 at the bottom. All this you realize and tolerate, 
 never suspecting that she’s the one you want.
  
  
     XVIII.
  
 When you are within shouting distance it is
 no matter, or next to none, what you say or
 whether we speak at all. It is enough
 to see, and covertly to love, your bright array of
 colorful traits. They are no sooner parceled out than
 stored up, secret accounts to be gone over until
 the whole single-spaced ledger is memorized.
  
 But when you leave, ledgers cannot contain you;
 time passes and the beloved blurs, the riotous gestures
 faded in substance, though not in force. I cannot hear
 your voice if I try; and what do I do when
 a free-floating affection outraces its
 visible target? From your splendid outpost
 that dazzles merely by being yours, send photos.
  
  
     XIX.
  
 Abroad, you are a mass of extra shadow
 falling on all you see. On its own a square
 is stiff and formidable; walk in it and 
 the arches tremble, the smells from the canal
 soften and linger. The red of the hills
 at evening is fit for a postcard home, until
 you step in the picture—and hand it back to the masters.
  
 It is straight out of a shoddy French novel
 to squeeze the continents into us/them
 categories and chapters—mold here, fruit there,
 stubble in places and wheat in others. Think me less
 a philistine when I say how little the steps
 of the journey frame you. It is you, torchbearer to 
 shrouded lands, who flood them with living color.
  
  
     XX.
  
 When I call you to mind, you respond sluggishly
 if at all. It is as if, being busy, you send
 a very expensive mannequin in your stead,
 a robot who dresses and walks like you but
 cannot capture your puzzling essence. Memory
 loves paradox: the more I require a stand-in,
 the looser the seams, the phonier the puppet.
  
 But I do not know this until the unexpected happens.
 Sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut,
 I come upon a diamond that puts them to shame;
 catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color
 in the street, I realize the cheapness of the household dolls
 I have been thinking about, relieved that even now,
 surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture.
  
  
     XXI.
  
 It will be objected that in missing you I forfeit
 a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers.
 There, an air of resolute calm prevails: it is always
 “Our minds are as one, and that is enough,”
 or “I saw him last night in the shape of a cloud,”
 or, harder still to believe, “Look at the
 useful machine I built instead of grieving.”
  
 They may brace themselves and speak of the 
 salubrious sublime; they may grit their teeth and
 bear it; their tourniqueted hearts are as
 undone as mine. Away, you are no
 homing compass or dove, but a roving, ceaselessly
 altering scoundrel. To miss you is to miss
 the loot you add to your repository of noises.
  
  
     XXII.
  
 Horses, birds, babysitters and jails,
 shadows, churches and trains; one would think
 you’d sat up with me all night, filling out forms
 on what images you preferred, or at least been
 consulted in the matter. Failing that, one might suppose you
 to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror
 as, one by one, strange pictures of you took flight.
  
 But you stumbled into this mess of blocks
 like the bumbling idiot in a screwball
 comedy. Center stage contained in cardboard boxes
 you tripped over before smiling and
 wandering on, in your madcap way, to new scrapes.
 Meanwhile, the whirligig thrives in your absence: booted cubes 
 swoon for their muse, a poltergeist in a bowtie.
  
  
     XXIII.
  
 A spider loved a bee and, knowing that to trap him
 would be to kill him, devised webs just flashy enough
 to keep the insect guessing. And soon,
 seeing in the spider’s handiwork traces
 of his own flower-hopping, the bee came
 closer. Arachnid vapors wafted over them as
 the bee proposed to die in the spider’s service.
  
 “No!” screamed the latter, tightening up her floss,
 and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed
 turf—roses and lilies next to whom (he saw)
 the spider was nothing. But she was not so lucky.
 The web she’d spun for him got tangled
 in her post mortem antenna-flailing, and finally wound
 around her neck and choked her. It was the end of the fable.
  
  
     XXIV.
  
 The more love grows, the bigger its sealed-off
 palace becomes, and the more pinched and dark its
 stoical keeper. Inside, sun breeds space: a ray
 that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it—
 only now there is not one room but many.
 Beams bright as lasers but gentler give away
 the safe behind the painting, the corridor under the rug.
  
 If only the keeper, hardened by circumstance,
 could learn from this endless illumination
 and turn the room inside out. Light would then
 seep through leathery skin, giving its secrets away
 in a gradually spreading glow, turning skin the orange
 of pure beatitude. But there are only two options for the keeper:
 to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent.
  
  
     XXV.
  
 Then, any enterprise requiring new clothes
 was privately hissed, if openly hailed;
 too close to a floral militia thinking as one
 were the standard frills, the required rustles,
 and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies,
 I called the clothes by their hidden agendas:
 ethical corsets, trusses of the spirit.
  
 Now I cry out for the colorful front
 of fancy dress, bow down in belated awe
 before silk and organza. It is not the delusion
 of being at my best, but the promise of further
 secrecy that thrills me; these veils only make
 unveiling all the stranger and wilder,
 and under my gown claw ghosts you’ll never see.
  
  
     XXVI.
  
 This sideshow of outlandish images
 is nothing like the main attractions of
 another time. Just after one picture clicks on
 and the eyes have adjusted, another, altogether
 different one takes its place, and another, and another.
 What in the world is going on? Did the projector
 gather together the uppermost slides on the pile?
  
 Nothing could be falser. It is only that 
 the replacement of the reel calls for as many 
 tricks and turns as possible to be an even
 passable substitute. Everything is its field;
 its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for
 things encyclopedic. This is the only way 
 it can capture your many angles—small comfort, yet comfort still.
  
  
     XXVII.
  
 The next time our paths cross there will be
 none of this shilly-shallying, this bondage,
 like it or not, to fickle time, brute locale.
 The crossing itself will slow down the march
 of the passing moment with its own
 unstoppable steam, its tenebrous and sultry
 collection of vapors. It will be love in a bottle.
  
 But there is always a screw loose somewhere,
 a gap in the glass that lets in a limber
 array of interlopers. From the mutual friend
 who smells a levity and wants in, to the premature bonging
 of the hour, to the false confines of the walls
 of our houses, there is always a damnable flaw
 in the system . . . and incoming elves who taunt “Excuses, excuses.”
  
  
     XXVIII.
  
 What is it about this flame I label passion
 that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp?
 How can I call myself hungry for the facts of one kind
 but wince at another? The lover’s room may be an
 all-white, tiny room with a view of woods, but why,
 if a well-meaning friend slides a special report
 under my door, do I look for tongs and a furnace?
  
 Because the flame is not only self-infatuated,
 given to burning documents for the sake
 of flaunting its own reds, but also in a state
 of permanent warfare; all worldly
 flare-ups, all currencies not its own, remind it
 that amid the worst incendiary horrors, it goes on
 stoking itself for want of a proper spark.
  
  
     XXIX.
  
 The catechism of the far gone: isn’t it too good
 to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that 
 billboard with the same unqualified disgust?
 Can we ignore the fact that you happened
 to witness the accident only minutes after I did?
 Is there more than just a flimsy link in
 a story jointly loved, a pastime avoided?
  
 No, yes, and by no means. These are the very
 traits which, observed in an enemy, get 
 shelved or denied by their once proud possessor.
 I could pillage an igloo, travel to the torrid
 antipodes and produce thousands like you,
 featured like you, like you in raves and complaints.
 I was bedazzled by a ray of fool’s gold.
  
  
     XXX.
  
 Go, tyrant. In your heart will nest
 no more desperate slaves. Come again, days
 of productivity, nights of rest and no nightmares.
 I have spent so much time under the shade
 of your massive umbrella that I will draw it shut
 for a minute to see what I once saw, and what I have
 missed since seeing you. Eyes, look unchained around you.
  
 It is a landscape of moldering stones and bones.
 When the eyes are free to roam, they are not
 so much free as useless—I see a sky of
 fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them, 
 peer into the living record of a severed oak and can
 decipher nothing. Return, dark glasses, come again,
 morbid parasol; only in shade do mountains have features.
  
  
     XXXI.
  
 In the final tally of divine overseers
 who will be ours? Suppose we claim
 the moon, whose bottomless bag of stardust
 enchants a forest of two, softens and 
 shrinks the volume of venomous air
 between us, and lovingly coats all former fears
 with beams of forgetful, nourishing light?
  
 Our watcher is the moon, but only after a brutal
 shake-up is through with her. She has never learned
 the knack of lighting two people at once; instead
 it is always me illumined, you off in the bushes,
 you posed in your halo, me waist-deep in darkness.
 And she is a clumsy goddess for the reason
 that she borrows (poor moon) what light she has from me.
  
  
     XXXII.
  
 Though you are by definition a slippery freedom,
 if forced to freeze you in a single image
 I would call you a beam of light with hidden powers
 to strike and alter forever. Here is a room:
 regard its monotone grimness. Enter your 
 incandescent highness: gladly around you
 objects sparkle, knowing a beam when they see it.
  
 Next to your flawless arc I am a damaged
 bulb in a fleabag hotel, clattering on to reveal
 paintings on velvet and objets trouvés (but where?),
 rattling off to plunge the run-down room into 
 dark desuetude. What if we pooled our forces?
 Would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture
 or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro?
  
  
     XXXIII.
  
 Perfect, you say? It is enough to make me perform
 operations on myself in order to test your love:
 taking in the wreckage, you would be forced to say
 “Yes, gouging out one eye makes the other shine
 all the brighter; the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer;
 your leprous stump is a modish charmer
 since, after all, green is my favorite color.”
  
 And yet, for all our tirades against deception,
 how easily do we succumb to the lover’s flattery,
 and with what treachery. If I am perfect, it is only
 by being perfect that you, myopic, dependable you
 can keep me; so go on, keep on calling me faultless, come on,
 hurry up with my supper, leave me, and come back at midnight,
 but don’t come back if you hear a noise in the room.
  
  
     XXXIV.

 
 Still the inveterate skulker, the ghost
 of chaos past, I have come back to the place
 where it all began, where leaving, you gave me
 leave to see you wherever I went—
 in the home, in the wild, in the sky, in the gutter—
 and where columns, scribbled on and abandoned,
 took one look at my raving, and rose again.
  
 Strangest of all is that, given the chance
 to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last,
 I would flatly refuse. These barren days
 when I heat my room by the fading coals of my goals,
 this ache for an ache is as good as it gets,
 so go on running; I will go on looking for you
 as the willow bends, as the stomach hunts for the ulcer.

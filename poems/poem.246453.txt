Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

I never hear that one is dead
Without the chance of Life
Afresh annihilating me
That mightiest Belief,

Too mighty for the Daily mind
That tilling it's abyss,
Had Madness, had it once or, Twice
The yawning Consciousness,

Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue
When Terror were it told
In any Tone commensurate
Would strike us instant Dead - 

I do not know the man so bold
He dare in lonely Place
That awful stranger - Consciousness
Deliberately face -

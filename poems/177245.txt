title : Irony

author : Louis Untermeyer

text : 
Why are the things that have no death 
The ones with neither sight nor breath! 
Eternity is thrust upon
A bit of earth, a senseless stone.
A grain of dust, a casual clod
Receives the greatest gift of God. 
A pebble in the roadway lies
                           It never dies.

The grass our fathers cut away 
Is growing on their graves today; 
The tiniest brooks that scarcely flow 
Eternally will come and go.
There is no kind of death to kill
The sands that lie so meek and still. . . . 
But Man is great and strong and wise
                           And so he dies.

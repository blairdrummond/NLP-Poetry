1. THE GARDEN Poco sostenuto in A major 
                        The laving tide of inarticulate air. 

                     Vivace in A major 
                        The iris people dance. 

2. THE POOL    Allegretto in A minor 
                        Cool-hearted dim familiar of the dove. 

3. THE BIRDS   Presto in F major 
                        I keep a frequent tryst. 

                     Presto meno assai 
                        The blossom-powdered orangeitree. 

4. TO THE MOON Allegro con brio in A major 
                            Moon that shone on Babylon. 




TO MOZART

What junipers are these, inlaid 
   With flame of the pomegranate tree? 
The god of gardens must have made 
   This still unrumored place for thee 
To rest from immortality, 
   And dream within the splendid shade 
Some more elusive symphony 
   Than orchestra has ever played.

title : Oh! Susanna

author : Stephen C. Foster

text : 
I came from Alabama
wid my ban jo on my knee,
I’m g’wan to Louisiana,
My true love for to see,
It raind all night the day I left
The weather it was dry,
The sun so hot I frose to death
Susanna dont you cry.

Oh! Susanna Oh! dont you cry for me
I’ve come from Alabama wid mi ban jo on my knee.

I jumped aboard de telegraph,
And trabbelled down de riber,
De Lectric fluid magnified,
And Killed five Hundred Nigger
De bullgine buste, de horse run off,
I realy thought I’d die;
I shut my eyes to hold my breath,
Susana, dont you cry.

Oh! Susana Oh! dont you cry for me
I’ve come from Alabama wid mi ban jo on my knee.

I had a dream de odder night,
When ebery ting was still;
I thought I saw Susana,
A coming down de hill.
The buckwheat cake war in her mouth,
The tear was in her eye,
Says I, im coming from de South,
Susana, dont you cry.

Oh! Susana Oh! dont you cry for me
I’ve come from Alabama wid mi ban jo on my knee.

I soon will be in New Orleans,
And den I’ll look all round,
And when I find Susana,
I’ll fall upon the ground.
But if I do not find her,
Dis darkie ’l surely die,
And when I’m dead and buried,
Susana, dont you cry.

Oh! Susana Oh! dont you cry for me
I’ve come from Alabama wid mi ban jo on my knee.

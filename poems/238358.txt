The food is on the table. Turkey tanned 
to a cowboy boot luster, potatoes mashed 
and mounded in a bowl whose lip is lined 
with blue flowers linked by grey vines faded 
from washing. Everyone’s heads have turned 
to elongate the table’s view—a last supper twisted 
toward a horizon where the Christmas tree, crowned 
by a window, sets into itself half inclined.   
Each belly cries. Each pair of eyes admonished 
by Aunt Photographer. Look up. You’re wined 
and dined for the older folks who’ve pined 
to see your faces, your lives, lightly framed 
in this moment’s flash. Parents are moved, 
press their children’s heads up from the table, 
hide their hunger by rubbing lightly wrinkled 
hands atop their laps. They’ll hold the image 
as long as need be, seconds away from grace.

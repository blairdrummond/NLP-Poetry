title : Hinged Double Sonnet for the Luna Moths

—Norton Island, Maine
For ten days now, two luna moths remain 
silk-winged and lavish as a double broach 
pinned beneath the porch light of my cabin. 
Two of them, patinaed that sea-glass green 
of copper weather vanes nosing the wind, 
the sun-lit green of rockweed, the lichen’s 
green scabbing-over of the bouldered shore, 
the plush green peat that carpets the island, 
that hushes, sinks then holds a boot print 
for days, and the sapling-green of new pines 
sprouting through it. The miraculous green 
origami of their wings—false eyed, doomed 
and sensual as the mermaid’s long green fins: 
a green siren calling from the moonlight. 

A green siren calling from the moonlight, 
from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches 
that shed, like tiny white decrees, scrolled bark. 
They emerge from cocoons like greased hinges, 
all pheromone and wing, instinct and flutter. 
They rise, hardwired, driven, through the creaking 
pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog. 
Two luna moths flitting like exotic birds 
towards only each other and light, in these 
their final few days, they mate, then starving 
they wait, inches apart, on my cabin wall 
to die, to share fully each pure and burning 
moment. They are, like desire itself, born 
without mouths. What, if not this, is love?

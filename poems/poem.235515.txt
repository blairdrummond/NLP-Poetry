And then we cowards 
who loved the whispering 
evening, the houses, 
the paths by the river, 
the dirty red lights 
of those places, the sweet 
soundless sorrow-- 
we reached our hands out 
toward the living chain 
in silence, but our heart 
startled us with blood, 
and no more sweetness then, 
no more losing ourselves 
on the path by the river-- 
no longer slaves, we knew 
we were alone and alive.

Rhymed Stanza

Often I had gone this way before:
 But now it seemed I never could be
 And never had been anywhere else;
 'Twas home; one nationality
 We had, I and the birds that sang,
 One memory.
 
They welcomed me. I had come back
 That eve somehow from somewhere far:
 The April mist, the chill, the calm,
 Meant the same thing familiar
 And pleasant to us, and strange too,
 Yet with no bar.
 
The thrush on the oaktop in the lane
 Sang his last song, or last but one;
 And as he ended, on the elm
 Another had but just begun
 His last; they knew no more than I
 The day was done.
 
Then past his dark white cottage front
 A labourer went along, his tread
 Slow, half with weariness, half with ease;
 And, through the silence, from his shed
 The sound of sawing rounded all
 That silence said.

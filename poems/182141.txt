text : 
The moon comes up. 
The moon goes down. 
This is to inform you 
that I didn’t die young. 
Age swept past me 
but I caught up. 
Spring has begun here and each day 
brings new birds up from Mexico. 
Yesterday I got a call from the outside 
world but I said no in thunder. 
I was a dog on a short chain 
and now there’s no chain.

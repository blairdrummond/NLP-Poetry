Metaphor, Rhymed Stanza

   Behold the rocky wall
   That down its sloping sides
Pours the swift rain-drops, blending, as they fall,
   In rushing river-tides!

   Yon stream, whose sources run
   Turned by a pebble's edge,
Is Athabasca, rolling toward the sun
   Through the cleft mountain-ledge.

   The slender rill had strayed,
   But for the slanting stone,
To evening's ocean, with the tangled braid
   Of foam-flecked Oregon.

   So from the heights of Will
   Life's parting stream descends,
And, as a moment turns its slender rill,
   Each widening torrent bends,--

   From the same cradle's side,
   From the same mother's knee,--
One to long darkness and the frozen tide,
   One to the Peaceful Sea!

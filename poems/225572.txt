title : The Potato Eaters

author : Leonard E. Nathan

text : 
Sometimes, the naked taste of potato 
reminds me of being poor. 

The first bites are gratitude, 
the rest, contented boredom. 

The little kitchen still flickers 
like a candle-lit room in a folktale. 

Never again was my father so angry, 
my mother so still as she set the table, 

or I so much at home.

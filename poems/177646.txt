text : 
The mountains carry snow, the season fails.   
Jackstraw clapboard shivers on its nails, 
the freezing air blows maple leaves and dust,   
a thousand nails bleed laceries of rust, 
slates crack and slide away, the gutters sprout.   
I wonder: do a dead man’s bones come out 

like these old lintels and wasp-riddled beams?   
I ask in simple consequence of structure seen   
in this old house, grown sturdy in its fall,   
the brace and bone of it come clear of all   
I took for substance, what I could not prove   
from any measure of design or love. 

Or is it rather that he falls away 
to no articulation but decay, 
however brightly leap the brass-hinged bone,   
beam and rafter, joist and cellar-stone?

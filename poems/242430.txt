title : A poem for vipers

author : John Wieners

text : 
I sit in Lees. At 11:40 PM with
 Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me 
 Ju Ju. Hot on the table before us
 shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
 chow yuke. Up the street under the wheels
 of a strange car is his stash—The ritual.
 We make it. And have made it.
 For months now together after midnight.
 Soon I know the fuzz will
 interrupt, will arrest Jimmy and 
 I shall be placed on probation. The poem
 does not lie to us. We lie under
 its law, alive in the glamour of this hour
 able to enter into the sacred places
 of his dark people, who carry secrets
 glassed in their eyes and hide words
 under the coats of their tongue.

title : Some Sort of Truth

author : Dorothea Lasky

text : 
When my dad first started to die
 All my mom could remember
 Was the time he kicked her out
 After they first started dating
 So that he could go play golf
 It is the sort of thing we all remember
 When we feel death upon us
 I remember he died twice
 And once in my dream
 I just had to see him all nursed and swaddled as if he were sleeping
 But he wasn’t sleeping
 I stood in the white light of the nursing home bathroom
 With the sun spilling everywhere on me
 And tried to talk to him, but never, he’d never listen
 People don’t always listen to you when they are dead
 But that’s not sad
 I get tired
 And I don’t listen to one Goddamn thing you are saying
 But that is because most of the time you bore me
 And when I am finally asleep it is really nice just to dream
 I have seen a lot of things in this life
 But one thing I saw most readily
 Was that despite his eternal heartbreak
 And girlish silliness
 Mike’s face was kind of sweet, a sweet wind
 He is going to think it is weird that I put him in this poem
 But I don’t think it is weird that I put him in this poem

Immersed
 we don’t
 ask
 who entered
 whose stream.
  
 Take
 my hand there
 is no
 line no
 bridge only
 fond
 foolishness—
  
 the bread
 crumbs I
 bring you
 in
 morning—
  
 they float
 on the
 surface
 water with
 two
 violins
  
 un-
 strung like
 the silent
 song
 on your
 lips soft
  
 as the
 same
 hands I
 crushed to
 keep
 you from
 death.

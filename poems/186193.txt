text : 
The cheap dropped ceiling 
         jumped like a pot-lid boiling 
when our upstairs neighbor 
      chased his girl that winter. 
             Falling out of 

summer’s skimpy tops 
    she’d want our phone. Her plush lips 
creased. Not exactly blonde, 
       but luteous, we thought, 
                     pleased the right word 

was there for that shade 
       of slightly slutty mermaid. 
Wincing, we’d hear him punch 
      along the floor on crutch- 
               es, a giant 

bat trying to mince 
         a mayfly. Sex and Violence 
you called them; Blondie with 
         Dagwood on crystal meth, 
               I’d tell our friends 

over dinners stewed 
       in noise. Even his truck cowed. 
Black, smoked glass, outsized wheels 
       flaunted like chrome knuckles 
                we shrank from, ducked, 

afraid we’d find her 
         later, knocking at our door. 
Some nights we waited through 
      like captured prey. To you 
               I’d turn in bed, 

saying the furtive
         words against your back, I love 
... You’d stroke my hair, or hip, 
         all our years the same flip 
                  crack, I do, too.

text : 
You shout my name
from beyond my dreams, 
beyond the picture window
of this Rosarito beach house. 
Rushing from bed to shore
I glimpse their backs—
volcanoes rising out of the sea.
Your back, a blue-black silhouette,
feet wet with the wash of morning waves.
Fountains spring from mammal minds, 
my hands lifting a splash of sand. 
I'm on my knees, 
toes finding a cool prayer
beneath them, fingers pressing
sea foam to my temples, 
while you open arms wide as a generation, 
raise them to a compass point, 
dive.
If you could reach them, 
you would ride their fins
under the horizon, 
then surf the crash of waves 
left in their wake. 
And if I could grasp
my own fear, 
I'd drown it, 
leave it breathless and blue
as this ocean, 
as the brilliant backs
of whales
surfacing 
for air.

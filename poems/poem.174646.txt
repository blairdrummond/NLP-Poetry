Home they brought her warrior dead: 
         She nor swoon'd nor utter'd cry: 
All her maidens, watching, said, 
         "She must weep or she will die." 

Then they praised him, soft and low, 
         Call'd him worthy to be loved, 
Truest friend and noblest foe; 
         Yet she neither spoke nor moved. 

Stole a maiden from her place, 
         Lightly to the warrior stepped, 
Took the face-cloth from the face; 
         Yet she neither moved nor wept. 

Rose a nurse of ninety years, 
         Set his child upon her knee-- 
Like summer tempest came her tears-- 
         "Sweet my child, I live for thee."

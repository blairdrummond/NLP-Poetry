With Usura
  
 With usura hath no man a house of good stone
 each block cut smooth and well fitting
 that design might cover their face,
 with usura 
 hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall
 harpes et luz
 or where virgin receiveth message
 and halo projects from incision,
 with usura
 seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines
 no picture is made to endure nor to live with
 but it is made to sell and sell quickly
 with usura, sin against nature, 
 is thy bread ever more of stale rags
 is thy bread dry as paper,
 with no mountain wheat, no strong flour
 with usura the line grows thick
 with usura is no clear demarcation
 and no man can find site for his dwelling.
 Stonecutter is kept from his tone
 weaver is kept from his loom
 WITH USURA
 wool comes not to market
 sheep bringeth no gain with usura
 Usura is a murrain, usura
 blunteth the needle in the maid’s hand
 and stoppeth the spinner’s cunning. Pietro Lombardo
 came not by usura
 Duccio came not by usura
 nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin’ not by usura
 nor was ‘La Calunnia’ painted.
 Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis,
 Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit.
 Not by usura St. Trophime
 Not by usura Saint Hilaire,
 Usura rusteth the chisel
 It rusteth the craft and the craftsman
 It gnaweth the thread in the loom
 None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;
 Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered
 Emerald findeth no Memling
 Usura slayeth the child in the womb
 It stayeth the young man’s courting
 It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth
 between the young bride and her bridegroom
                                CONTRA NATURAM
 They have brought whores for Eleusis
 Corpses are set to banquet
 at behest of usura. 
  
  
  
 N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the failure of the Medici bank.)

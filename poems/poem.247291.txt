Crumbling is not an instant's Act
A fundamental pause
Dilapidation's processes
Are organized Decays --

'Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul
A Cuticle of Dust
A Borer in the Axis
An Elemental Rust --

Ruin is formal -- Devil's work
Consecutive and slow --
Fail in an instant, no man did
Slipping -- is Crashe's law --

title : Finding the Space in the Heart

author : Gary Snyder

text : 
I first saw it in the sixties,
 driving a Volkswagen camper
 with a fierce gay poet and a
 lovely but dangerous girl with a husky voice,
  
 we came down from Canada
 on the dry east side of the ranges. Grand Coulee, Blue
 Mountains, lava flow caves,
 the Alvord desert—pronghorn ranges—
 and the glittering obsidian-paved
 dirt track toward Vya,
 seldom-seen roads late September and
 thick frost at dawn; then
 follow a canyon and suddenly open to
           silvery flats that curved over the edge
  
           O, ah! The
           awareness of emptiness
           brings forth a heart of compassion!
  
 We followed the rim of the playa
 to a bar where the roads end
 and over a pass into Pyramid Lake
 from the Smoke Creek side,
 by the ranches of wizards
 who follow the tipi path.
 The next day we reached San Francisco
 in a time when it seemed
 the world might head a new way.
  
 And again, in the seventies, back from
 Montana, I recklessly pulled off the highway
 took a dirt track onto the flats,
 got stuck—scared the kids—slept the night,
 and the next day sucked free and went on.
  
 Fifteen years passed. In the eighties
 With my lover I went where the roads end.
 Walked the hills for a day,
 looked out where it all drops away,
 discovered a path
 of carved stone inscriptions tucked into the sagebrush
  
           “Stomp out greed”
           “The best things in life are not things”
  
 words placed by an old desert sage.
  
 Faint shorelines seen high on these slopes,
 long gone Lake Lahontan,
 cutthroat trout spirit in silt—
 Columbian Mammoth bones
 four hundred feet up on the wave-etched
           beach ledge; curly-horned
                     desert sheep outlines pecked into the rock,
  
 and turned the truck onto the playa
 heading for know-not,
 bone-gray dust boiling and billowing,
 mile after mile, trackless and featureless,
 let the car coast to a halt
 on the crazed cracked
 flat hard face where
 winter snow spirals, and
 summer sun bakes like a kiln.
 Off nowhere, to be or not be,
  
           all equal, far reaches, no bounds.
           Sound swallowed away         
           no waters, no mountains, no
           bush no grass and
                     because no grass
           no shade but your shadow.
           No flatness because no not-flatness.
           No loss, no gain. So—
           nothing in the way!
           —the ground is the sky
           the sky is the ground,
           no place between, just
  
           wind-whip breeze,
           tent-mouth leeward,
           time being here.
           We meet heart to heart,
           leg hard-twined to leg,
                     with a kiss that goes to the bone.
           Dawn sun comes straight in the eye. The tooth
           of a far peak called King Lear.
  
 Now in the nineties desert night
           —my lover’s my wife—
 old friends, old trucks, drawn around;
 great arcs of kids on bikes out there in darkness
           no lights—just planet Venus glinting
 by the calyx crescent moon,
 and tasting grasshoppers roasted in a pan.
  
           They all somehow swarm down here—
           sons and daughters in the circle
           eating grasshoppers grimacing,
  
 singing sūtras for the insects in the wilderness,
  
 —the wideness, the
 foolish loving spaces
  
 full of heart.
  
           Walking on walking,
                     under foot   earth turns
  
           Streams and mountains never stay the same.
  
  
  
  
                               The space goes on.
                               But the wet black brush
                               tip drawn to a point,
                                        lifts away.

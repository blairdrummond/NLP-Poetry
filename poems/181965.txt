title : How Beautiful

author : Mary Jo Bang

text : 
A personal lens: glass bending rays 
That gave one that day’s news 
Saying each and every day, 

Just remember you are standing 
On a planet that’s evolving. 
How beautiful, she thought, what distance does 

For water, the view from above or afar. 
In last night’s dream, they were back again 
At the beginning. She was a child 

And he was a child. 
A plane lit down and left her there. 
Cold whitening the white sky whiter. 

Then a scalpel cut her open for all the world 
To be a sea.

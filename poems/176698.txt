title : Discontents in Devon

author : Robert Herrick

text : 
More discontents I never had
         Since I was born, than here;
Where I have been, and still am, sad,
         In this dull Devonshire.
Yet justly too I must confess,
         I ne'er invented such
Ennobled numbers for the press,
         Than where I loath'd so much.

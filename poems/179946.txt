tomorrow we'll see the lightbulb in schenectady, 
go to gems farms in schodack, then on to howe caverns, 
then to see the wayne thiebaud show at the clark 
where we'll stop to notice the melting ice sculpture 
then excellent spinach sap soup at the thai restaurant 
in williamstown, a brief stop at the octagonal museum, 
on to northampton to see the smith college art museum 
& greenhouse where we'll see a green heron 

it would be nice to be able to walk today 
so we could go to opus 40 in saugerties 
followed by a dinner of oysters & mussels at the bear 
then on to check out the sheep at the sheepherding inn 
where we're able to buy riccotta cheese 
which means twice-baked, with which we're able 
to make a pizza with fresh figs gotten from the berry farm 
                           war what is it good for? 
                           absolutely nothing

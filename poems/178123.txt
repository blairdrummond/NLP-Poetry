title : Picture of a Nativity

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
Sea-preserved, heaped with sea-spoils,   
Ribs, keels, coral sores, 
Detached faces, ephemeral oils,   
Discharged on the world’s outer shores, 

A dumb child-king 
Arrives at his right place; rests,   
Undisturbed, among slack serpents; beasts   
With claws flesh-buttered. In the gathering 

Of bestial and common hardship   
Artistic men appear to worship 
And fall down; to recognize 
Familiar tokens; believe their own eyes. 

Above the marvel, each rigid head,   
Angels, their unnatural wings displayed,   
Freeze into an attitude 
Recalling the dead.

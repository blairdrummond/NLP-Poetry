title : Sailing to America

Alexandria, 1956
The rugs had been rolled up and islands of them   
Floated in the centers of every room, 
And now, on the bare wood floors, 
My sister and I were skimming among them   
In the boats we’d made from newspaper,   
Sheets of them pinned to each other, 
Dhows, gondolas, clippers, arks. 
There was a mule outside on the street   
Braying under a load of figs, though mostly   
There was quiet, a wind from the desert   
Was putting the city to sleep, 
But we were too far adrift, the air 
Was scurfy and wet, the currents tricking   
Our bows against reef and coral 
And hulls shearing under the weight of cargo.   
“Ahoy and belay!” I called to my sister, 
“Avast, avast!” she yelled back from her rigging,   
And neither of us knew what we were saying   
But the words came to us as from a movie,   
Cinemascopic, American. “Richard Widmark,”   
I said. “Clark Gable, Bogie,” she said, 
“Yo-ho-ho.” We had passed Cyprus 
And now there was Crete or Sardinia 
Maybe something larger further off. 
The horizon was everywhere I turned, 
The waters were becoming turgid, 
They were roiling, weeks had passed. 
“America, America, land-ho!” I yelled directionless.   
“Gibraltar,” my sister said, “Heave to,”   
And signalling a right, her arm straight out,   
She turned and bravely set our course   
North-by-northwest for the New World. 
Did we arrive? Years later, yes. 
By plane, suddenly. With suitcases   
And something as hazy as a future. 
The November sun was pale and far off,   
The air was colder than we’d ever felt,   
And already these were wonders to us 
As much as snow would be or evergreens,   
And it would take me a long time   
Before I’d ever remember 
Boats made of paper, islands of wool,   
And my sister’s voice, as in a fog,   
Calling out the hazards, 
Leading me on, getting us there.

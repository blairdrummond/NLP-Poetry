title : What the Frost Casts Up

author : Ed Ochester

text : 
A crown of handmade nails, as though   
there were a house here once, burned,   
where we’ve gardened for fifteen years;   
the ceramic top of an ancient fuse;   
this spring the tiny head of a plastic doll—   
not much compared to what they find   
in England, where every now and then   
a coin of the Roman emperors, Severus   
or Constantius, works its way up, but   
something, as though nothing we’ve   
ever touched wants to stay in the earth,   
the patient artifacts waiting, having been lost   
or cast away, as though they couldn’t bear   
the parting, or because they are the only   
messengers from lives that were important once,   
waiting for the power of the frost   
to move them to the mercy of our hands.

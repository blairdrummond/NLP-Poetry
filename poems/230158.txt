text : 
The doll told me   
to exist. 

It said, “Hypnotize yourself.” 

It said time would be   
transfixed. 

                     * 

Now the optimist 

sees an oak   
shiver 

and a girl whiz by   
on a bicycle 

with a sense of pleasurable   
suspense. 

She budgets herself   
with leafy 

prestidigitation. 

I too 
am a segmentalist. 

                     * 

But I’ve dropped   
more than an armful 

of groceries or books 

downstairs 
into a train station. 

An acquaintance says   
she colors her hair 

so people will help her   
when this happens. 

To refute her argument,   
I must wake up 

and remember my hair’s   
already dyed. 

                     * 

As a mentalist,   
I must suffer 

lapses 

then repeat myself   
in a blind trial. 

I must write   
punchlines only I   
can hear 

and only after   
I’ve passed on

title : Rwanda: Where Tears Have No Power

Who has the moral high ground? 

Fifteen blocks from the whitehouse 
on small corners in northwest, d.c. 
boys disguised as me rip each otherâ€™s hearts out 
with weapons made in china. they fight for territory. 

across the planet in a land where civilization was born 
the boys of d.c. know nothing about their distant relatives 
in Rwanda. they have never heard of the hutu or tutsi people. 
their eyes draw blanks at the mention of kigali, byumba 
or butare. all they know are the streets of d.c., and do not 
cry at funerals anymore. numbers and frequency have a way 
of making murder commonplace and not news 
unless it spreads outside of our house, block, territory. 

modern massacres are intraethnic. bosnia, sri lanka, burundi, 
nagorno-karabakh, iraq, laos, angola, liberia, and rwanda are 
small foreign names on a map made in europe. when bodies 
by the tens of thousands float down a river turning the water 
the color of blood, as a quarter of a million people flee barefoot 
into tanzania and zaire, somehow we notice. we do not smile, 
we have no more tears. we hold our thoughts. In deeply 
muted silence looking south and thinking that today 
nelson mandela seems much larger 
than he is.

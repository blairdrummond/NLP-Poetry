title : Writ on the Steps of Puerto Rican Harlem

author : Gregory Corso

text : 
There’s a truth limits man 
A truth prevents his going any farther   
The world is changing 
The world knows it’s changing 
Heavy is the sorrow of the day 
The old have the look of doom 
The young mistake their fate in that look   
That is truth 
But it isn’t all truth 

Life has meaning 
And I do not know the meaning   
Even when I felt it were meaningless 
I hoped and prayed and sought a meaning 
It wasn’t all frolic poesy 
There were dues to pay   
Summoning Death and God   
I’d a wild dare to tackle Them 
Death proved meaningless without Life 
Yes the world is changing   
But Death remains the same   
It takes man away from Life   
The only meaning he knows   
And usually it is a sad business   
This Death 

I’d an innocence I’d a seriousness 
I’d a humor save me from amateur philosophy 
I am able to contradict my beliefs   
I am able able 
Because I want to know the meaning of everything 
Yet sit I like a brokenness   
Moaning: Oh what responsibility   
I put on thee Gregory 
Death and God 
Hard hard it’s hard 

I learned life were no dream 
I learned truth deceived 
Man is not God   
Life is a century   
Death an instant

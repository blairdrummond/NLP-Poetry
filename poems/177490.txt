title : In the Novel

author : Susan Stewart

text : 
He described her mouth as full of ashes.   
So when he kissed her finally   
he was thinking about ashes 

and the blacker rim just below   
the edge of the ashtray, 
and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips, 

and the lips themselves, at the limit   
of another darkness, farther   
and far more interior. 

Then the way the red, 
paling, just outside those lines   
caught fire and the pages caught 

soon after that. Slowly at first,   
but then all at once 
at the scalloped brown corners of each; 

like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird,   
extended, then folded 
in on itself; multiple, 

stiffening, gone.

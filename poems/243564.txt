title : Coming to That

author : Dorothea Tanning

text : 
“If it comes to that,” he said, “there’ll be no
 preventing it.”
 He uttered it as I listened. Had I got it right,
 hearing him?
 “If it comes to that,” is what he said, and, 
 as if talking
 to himself, went on about how there’d be no
 preventing it.
 He came to that conclusion, saying it in a 
 slow way of
 coming to that, whatever that was it might
 come to before
 not being prevented—and as if such a thing
 were for him
 the unthinkable, and would prevail, if it 
 came to that.
  
 And while listening more closely now to
 what he said, 
 I realized if no one paid him heed, it would
 be as if he
 hadn’t said it—if it came to that—and would
 then not be
 prevented from falling to forces known to 
 care little for
 what he said, even if they heard it, their
 being wily
 and forceful enough to make sure it would 
 come to that.

					“peacekeeping troops”“tanks beneath the windows”The inside of someone else’s dwelling visible — a table and some chairs.You start to count one, two, three, four . . . until the explosion is near your neighborhood.You can guess the position of mortar by this counting and try to find a safe place.If the windows are gone, weak plastic is taped up but the strong wind comes and we stay awake. In this South Cholla Province where all vehicles had been confiscated, we resorted to walking, the method of travel of the Yi Dynasty. We reverted back 300 years.                                                                                                Kwangju, 1980It’s the same to be in the house, at the shelter or anywhere. There is no safe place.

The child’s assignment:   
“What is a city?” 
All dusk she sucks her pencil   
while cars swish by 
like ghosts, neighbors’ radios   
forecast rain, high clouds,   
diminishing winds: at last 
she writes: “The city is everyone.” 
       Now it’s time 
for math, borrowing and exchanging,   
the long discipleship 
to zero, the stranger, 
the force that makes us 
what we study: father and child,   
writing in separate books,   
infinite and alone.

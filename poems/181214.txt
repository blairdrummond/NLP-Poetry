more the idea of the flame than the flame, 
as in: the flame 

of the rose petal, the flame of the thorn 
the sun is a flame, the dog’s teeth 

flames 

~ 

to be clear: with the body, 

captain, we can do as we wish, we can do 
as we wish with the body 

but we cannot leave marks—capt’n I’m 
trying to get this right 

~ 

the world’s so small, the sky’s so high 
we pray for rain it rains, we pray for sun it suns 

we pray on our knees, we move our lips 
we pray in our minds, we clasp our hands 

our hands look tied before us 

~ 

I remember, capt’n, something, it didn’t happen, not 
to me—this guy, I knew him by 

face, I don’t remember his 
name, one night 
he’s walking home from a party, a car it 

clipped him, for hours he 
wandered, dazed, his family, his 
neighbors, with flashlights they 

searched, all night, the woods, calling out 
his name 

~ 

here’s the part, capt’n, where I try to tell a story 
as if it were a confession: once, 

in elementary school, I was hiding out 
on damon rock, lighting 
matches & letting them drop to the leaves 

below—little flare- 

ups, flash fires—a girl wandered 
down the path, she just 

stood there, watching the matches fall from my hand— 

~ 

capt’n, I’m trying to be precise: hot 

day, a cage in the sun, a room without 
air, the mind-bending heat, the music 

a flame—hey 
metallica hey britanny hey airless hey fuse, I 

don’t know how it happened, I was perched far 
above, I offered her a match 

to pull down her pants—one match, her 
hairless body, hey 

little girl, I dropped it unlit.   

I didn’t know what it was I was looking at. 

~ 

hey capt’n I don’t know if I’m allowed 
hey capt’n years ago I’m walking 

down a road one drunk night, even now I 
wonder—sometimes still I 

imagine—was I hit by a bus, am I stumbling am I   

dazed, this 

dream this confession, hey 
little girl is yr daddy home, hey capt’n hey 

sir am I making any sense? 

~ 

the boy stood on the burning deck, stammering 
elocution, wait— 
the boy stood in the burning cage, stammering 
electrocution, no—the boy stood in the hot-hot room 
stammering I did stammering I did stammering I 
did stammering I did stammering everything you say I did 
I did. 

~ 

hey metallica hey britanny hey airless hey fuse 
hey phonograph hey hades hey thoughtless hey 

~ 

capt’n this room is on fire 
capt’n, this body will not stop burning 
capt’n oh my captain this burning has become a body
capt’n oh my captain this child is ash 
capt’n oh my captain my hands pass right through her 
capt’n oh my captain I don’t know what it is I’m looking at 

~ 

it’s important to be precise, to say what 
I know— 

the sun is fire, the center of the earth 
is fire, yr mother’s cunt is 

fire, an airless flame, still, still, I don’t know why 
she pushed me out, this cold-cold furnace, we all 

were pushed, a rim of light around our heads, she 
gave a kick, sent us crawling 

out, toward the flame, toward the pit, the flaming 
pit, yr lover’s 
cunt, the flame her tongue, the flame 

a thorn 

~ 

everyday, capt’n, sir, captain, I was 
left, a child, after school, I was alone, I found 

a match, under the sink I found a can, a spray 
can, ly-sol dis-infectant, it made a 

torch, I was careful the flame didn’t 
enter the can, I knew it 

would explode, somehow I knew, I’m 
trying to be clear sir—the flame 

shot across the room, then it was gone

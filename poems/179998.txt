Drepung, Tibet, 1958
So won a name in this place,   
handing off lath strips to a hammer's   
measure, seeing the passing girls' slits   
in roils of timber grain. 

Mountains, barley, scaffold,   
dirt. I was sixteen. And hourly   
from the hoods of faraway bells   
monks emerging like hairless animals. 

I was sixteen. What did I know   
of sovereignty, or the new soldiers   
by the gate, chinning their shotguns   
like violins? Nights, a tin roof 

wind cracked flat; my sister,   
flushed with child, hushing a child.

title : Tormented

author : Pura López-Colomé

text : 
Enormous solids were falling 
from who knows what heights, 
who knows what places. 
I trembled, 
and in my mouth 
an inky taste. Precise. 

Hail, maybe, 
enormous kernels of ice; 
coming down, 
with a scandalous impact, 
didn't bury me, terrorized, 
under the covers. 
It didn't happen, it wasn't that. 

A below zero temperature   
circulated through the soft center of my bones. 
A truly searing cold.   

Nothing having to do with monsters came to pass. 
Nothing to do with interminable distances. 
No brutal incidents. 
Only the agony of acorns. 
Only a cycle that completes itself 
every few years 
and transforms into a tropical forest 
a choiring oak grove.   

Which is the fear.

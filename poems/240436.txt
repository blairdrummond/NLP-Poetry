There are the few we hear of
 like Christ, who, with divine grace,
 made goodness look easy, had
 a following to draw near, gave up
 the right things and saw to it
 that sinners got listened to.
 Sharpening my failures, I remember
 the Jains, the gentle swoosh
 of their brooms on a dirt path
 trodden by children and goats, each
 thoughtful step taken in peril of
 an ant’s life or a fat grub hidden
 under a stick. In the car-wash,
 thinking of yogis under a tree
 plucking hair by hair the head
 of an initiate, I feel at least
 elsewhere those able for holiness—
 its signs and rigors—are at work.
 Ignominiously, I am here, brushes
 clamped, soap and water pulsing
 against my car. (A good sign too,
 those asylums for old and diseased
 animals.) My car is clean
 and no one has had to 
 lift a finger. The dead
 bugs have been gushed away into a soup
 of grit and foam—the evidence
 not subterranean, not streaming along
 the asphalt in sunlight so dazzling
 I attend the birth-moment of 
 the word Hosannah!
  
 I care about the bugs and not
 in this life will I do enough towards
 my own worth in the memory
 of them. I appreciate the Jains,
 their atonements for my neglect,
 though I understand it makes poor farmers
 of them, and good we all
 don’t aspire to such purity so
 there’s somebody heartless enough to 
 plow the spuds.
  
 Early on in admiration, I put off
 knowledge, and so delayed reading about
 the Jains—not to lose
 solace. But in the County Library,
 turning a page, I meet them as
 the wealthiest moneylenders
 in Western India. Reading on, 
 I’m encouraged—the list of virtues
 exceeds vices—just four
 of those: anger, pride, illusion and
 greed. The emphasis clearly on 
 striving. I write them down
 in the corner of a map
 of Idaho: forbearance, indulgence, 
 straightforwardness, purity, 
 veracity, restraint, freedom from
 attachment to anything, poverty
 and chastity.
  
 Choosing, getting into the car to 
 get to the supermarket, hearing
 over engine noise the bright agonies
 of birds, the radio news with the child
 nailed into a broom-closet for
 twenty-four hours by parents who
 in straightforwardness sacrificed
 forbearance, I feel a longing 
 for religion, for doctrine swift 
 as a broom to keep the path 
 clear. Later, alone in the kitchen
 with the groceries, I read the list
 again. Overwhelmed by the loneliness
 of the saints, I take up my broom
 and begin where I stand,
 with linoleum.

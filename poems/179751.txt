title : Sonnet

author : Robert Hass

text : 
A man talking to his ex-wife on the phone. 
He has loved her voice and listens with attention 
to every modulation of its tone. Knowing   
it intimately. Not knowing what he wants 
from the sound of it, from the tendered civility. 
He studies, out the window, the seed shapes 
of the broken pods of ornamental trees. 
The kind that grow in everyone’s garden, that no one 
but horticulturists can name. Four arched chambers 
of pale green, tiny vegetal proscenium arches, 
a pair of black tapering seeds bedded in each chamber. 
A wish geometry, miniature, Indian or Persian,   
lovers or gods in their apartments. Outside, white, 
patient animals, and tangled vines, and rain.

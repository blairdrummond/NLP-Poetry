I forgot to tell you it's almost time to go.
The sun has distilled its particular worn essence 
And the glittering trout is flipped on the bow.   

A man asks me what time it is. I don't know.   
I have emptied my purse and wept in the presence   
Of onlookers. I forgot to remember to go 

Before eleven, when the steely arrow 
Shot swimming to its underneath, tense 
As a stream of salmon in reverse below 

The laureled, relentless clocks. The sceptered row 
Of columns dreams one o'clock, immense,   
Inviolate. What time is it? I don't know.   

This story concerns the night I tried to go— 
Though many times I flopped into the silence 
Of orange plastic seating like onto the bow 

Of a lonely ship, and felt my breathing slow. 
The frail, retreating stand of columns prevents 
The clocks from telling me time and time again to go.   
At my feet, a glittering trout swims past the bow.

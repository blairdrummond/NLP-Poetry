title : After the Funeral

author : Peter Everwine

text : 
We opened closets and bureau drawers
 and packed away, in boxes, dresses and shoes, 
the silk underthings still wrapped in tissue. 
We sorted through cedar chests. We gathered 
and set aside the keepsakes and the good silver 
and brought up from the coal cellar
 jars of tomato sauce, peppers, jellied fruit.
 We dismantled, we took down from the walls, 
we bundled and carted off and swept clean. 
Goodbye, goodbye, we said, closing
 the door behind us, going our separate ways 
from the house we had emptied,
 and which, in the coming days, we would fill 
again and empty and try to fill again.

title : Still Life

author : Roberto Tejada

text : 
We’d often 
 been included in
  
 the weather, whose
 changes (as in the
  
 still, portending
 darknesses of after
  
 noon) were hardly
 evident, if even
  
 manifest at all.
 The August rain
  
 over Mixcoac
 & the deadening 
  
 of all aspect
 at a distance:
  
 yet our sudden
 wet bodies, firm
  
 swelling divested
 finally of shirts
  
 & trousers, left
 beside turbid
  
 footprints on 
 the tiled floor;
  
 this tongue, these
 lips the lightning
  
 over the unchartered
 landscape of your
  
 thigh: successive
 terra nova to
  
 resist the still
 life of the body

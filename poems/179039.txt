title : Leaflet on Wooing

author : Lucie Brock-Broido

text : 
Wanting is reposed and plump   
As the hands of a Romanov child 

Folded in the doeskin sashes of her lap,   
Paused before the little war begins. 

            This one will be guttural, this war.   
How is it possible to still be startled 

As I am by the oblong silhouette of the coiling   
Index finger of a pending death. 

No longer will 
                        Wooing be the wondrous 

Thing; instead, a homely domesticity, constant   
As a field of early rye and yarrow-light. 

What one is fit to stand is not what one is   
Given, necessarily, and not this night.

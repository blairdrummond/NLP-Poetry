title : The God of Inattention

author : Averill Curdy

text : 
After the trumpets, after the incense    
There were nights insomnia fathered gods    
I then rejected as too angry or distracted,    
Or whose appetite for submission revealed    
Their own lack of faith.   Say our names,    
All synonyms for trust. Others spoke    
In sugared paradox:  To know is to know    
All. To not know all is not to know. To know    
All requires that you know very little,    
But to know that little you have to know    
All . And for a while, it's true,    
I burned in the dark fires of ambivalence,    
My attention consumed like oxygen.    
I'd wake up tired, as I had with the married man    
Whose strictures and caprice begat,    
And begat, and begat, and begat    
My love for him, harvesting the same      
Silence from my bed. Who listens    
To my penitential tune? Who accepts    
My petitions for convenient parking,    
For spring, for the self illuminated    
Across a kitchen table, for . . . for    
Fortitude? I've heard a voice, I'm sure,    
Advising me to drop this sentimental farce.    
Only to hold the smoke of their names    
Again in my mouth I'd resurrect    
The dead, or adopt the gods orphaned    
By atheists, except the gods they've made    
From disbelief no one's faith could tolerate.    
Refusing to make the same mistake    
Just once, I've cried out to the dark    
Many names, most given up as routinely    
As the secrets of friends. If you're a cup      
Will my lips profane your own? If a comb      
Will I feel your teeth against my neck?      
If a wall I will be darker than your shadow.    
And if a door I will unlatch you, letting in    
All the little foxes from the vineyard.

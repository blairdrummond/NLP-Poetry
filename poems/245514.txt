(a found poem, composed entirely of e-mails from various high school students)
If I were to ask you a question about your book
 and sum it up into one word it would be, Why?
 I think I like Walt Whitman better than you. I just don't
 get literature, but for a fast hour and a half read, your book
  
 takes the cake. I like how you organized the lines
 in that one poem to represent a growing twisting bonsai tree.
 Are you going to get a rude reaction when you meet
 that one guy in that one poem? I guess you never know.
  
 You are very young to be a poet. I also like how your poems take
 up an entire page (it makes our reading assignment go faster).
 In class we spend so much time dissecting your poems
 and then deeply analyzing them. I think I like Walt Whitman
  
 better than you, but don’t take offense—you are very good too!
 You are young, You are young and pure and really just want
 to have a good time. Thank you we have taken a debate
 and you are a far better poet than Walt Whitman. And I loved
  
 how your poems were easy to read and understand. Hello
 my name is Alicia. We read you book and I just loved it.
 We also read Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. There
 was no competition there. I liked your book a whole lot better.
  
 It was an easy read. But poetry is not my favorite type
 of literature. Sometimes I am offered drinks and guys
 try to talk to me but I too just brush it off and keep dancing.
 Every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you
  
 things and then they say something. What would you do?
 Lastly, I was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really
 didn’t have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried
 to give it one anyways? Walt Whitman is better than you.

"I gave birth to a princess," her mother 
once told me, and I thought of my son pouring 
his Grape-Nuts in the garage so as not to wake her, 

of the moment her baby, seeing her 
now a separate entity, seemed not to breathe, 
refused to blink her sapphire eyes. 

I remembered again last night as she 
and I crossed a Florida street, the caution 
light running gold streamers 

over the dark sweep of her hair, 
when a young man coming toward us halted 
midway a moment, stunned, before moving on. 

So what is this Divine Right—less 
than bloodlines, or more? More than symmetry 
of face or a silver necklace nestled 

at a flawless throat, the nerve to send back 
bad food in restaurants, more than the big, 
loopy handwriting of the generous spirit? 

Call it bravery, that eager readiness 
in the eyes, the quality of the light shining 
there. Call it blessed assurance. 

Today, pony-tailed, she luxuriates in sun, 
opulent in a hot pink bikini. In deference 
the ocean leans away, a backdrop. 

I find myself bent, studying the shore for perfect 
shells to lay at her feet—cat's paw, prickly 
cockle, angel wing. Call it homage, more or less.

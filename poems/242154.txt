title : After Love

author : Maxine W. Kumin

text : 
Afterward, the compromise.
 Bodies resume their boundaries.
  
 These legs, for instance, mine.
 Your arms take you back in.
  
 Spoons of our fingers, lips
 admit their ownership.
  
 The bedding yawns, a door
 blows aimlessly ajar
  
 and overhead, a plane
 singsongs coming down.
  
 Nothing is changed, except
 there was a moment when
  
 the wolf, the mongering wolf
 who stands outside the self
  
 lay lightly down, and slept.﻿

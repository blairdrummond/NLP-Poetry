title : This Scribe, My Hand

author : Ben Belitt

text : 
When this warm scribe, my hand, is in the grave.  —John Keats 
1. 

You are here 
on the underside of the page,   
writing in water, 

anachronist,   
showing your head   
with its delicate fuses, 

its fatal telemetry, 
a moundful of triggers and gunpowder   
like a field-mine, 

your sixty-one inches 
and your gem-cutter’s fingers,   
anonymous, 

taking the weight 
of a “roomful of people”   
but making no mark, 

pressing the page as I write,   
while the traffic in Rome, 
demotic with engines and klaxons, 

circles the Pyramid of Cestius,   
crosses a graveyard, and submerges   
again like the fin of a shark. 


    2. 

I write, in the posthumous way,   
on the flat of a headstone 
with a quarrier’s ink, like yourself: 

an anthologist’s date and an asterisk,   
a parenthetical mark in the gas   
of the pyramid-builders, 

an obelisk whirling with Vespas   
in a poisonous motorcade. 
I make your surgeon’s incision for 

solitude—one living hand, two 
poets strangled in seawater and phlegm,   
an incestuous 

ego to reach for 
the heart in the funeral ashes,   
a deathbed with friends. 


    3. 

Something murderous flows   
from the page to my hand— 
a silence that wars 

with the letters, a fist 
that closes on paper: a blow   
with the straight edge of a razor 

that falls with a madman’s   
monotony; or the adze 
of a sleepwalking Sumerian 

nicking the wet of the clay,   
hacking a wedge in a tablet   
in the blood and the mica, 

till all glistens with language. 
The criminal folds up his claspknife. The shutters   
slam down on the streets. Nobody listens. 


    4. 

Out of breath with the climb, and   
tasting a hashish of blood, 
what did he see on the brink 

of the Piazza di Spagna? A hand   
in the frame of a cithara   
where beggars and sunbathers 

clotted the levels like musical   
signatures, a Wordsworthian   
dream of “degree,” “unimaginable 

time” touched by an axe   
blade—or a pram   
on the Steps of Odessa 

torn from the hands of 
its mother, gathering speed for the   
plunge and rocking its tires 

in the rifling, like a gun barrel,   
smashing its way through the Tzar’s   
executioners, to a scream at the bottom? 


    5. 

A failed solitude ... The bees   
in the Protestant grass 
speak of it delicately 

in the sweat of a 
Palatine summer, guiding my hand   
through the Braille of the letters. 

Violet, bluet, or squill— 
what was it I picked   
under the epitaph, what 

rose to my touch 
in the thirst of the marble, a cup   
from the well of your grave 

in the noonday miasma, 
a hieroglyph in the water, saying:   
solitude, solitude, solitude: 

you have it at last—your   
solitude writing on water,   
alone with its failure. 


    6. 

You are there 
on the underside of the page,   
a blue flower in my Baedeker, 

writing on water. I know it.   
The paper pulls under my pen   
peaks into waves 

running strongly into the horizon.   
The emptiness hardens   
with balustrades, risers, and levels, 

a staircase of Roman 
azaleas. I slip on the blood and the ink   
toward the exigent bed 

of a poet. All is precarious. A maniac 
waits on the streets. Nobody listens. What   
must I do? I am writing on water, 

blazing with failures, ascending,   
descending among lovers and trippers.   
You are pressing me hard 

under the paper. At Santa Trinità dei Monti   
the stairway parts like an   
estuary, rises and falls like a fountain. 

There is nothing to see but a death-mask, your   
room in an island of risers and treads, oddly   
gregarious, an invisible hand in the granite. 


    7. 

The tidal salts drain on a living horizon,   
leaving a glare on the blemishing 
paper. The silence is mortal. 
                                                       Nobody answers.

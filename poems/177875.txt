title : Radiator

author : Connie Wanek

text : 
Mittens are drying on the radiator, 
boots nearby, one on its side. 
Like some monstrous segmented insect 
the radiator elongates under the window. 

Or it is a beast with many shoulders 
domesticated in the Ice Age. 
How many years it takes 
to move from room to room! 

Some cage their radiators 
but this is unnecessary 
as they have little desire to escape. 

Like turtles they are quite self-contained. 
If they seem sad, it is only the same sadness 
we all feel, unlovely, growing slowly cold.

title : One Boy Told Me

text : 
Music lives inside my legs. 
It’s coming out when I talk.

I’m going to send my valentines 
to people you don’t even know.

Oatmeal cookies make my throat gallop.

Grown-ups keep their feet on the ground 
when they swing. I hate that.

Look at those 2 o’s with a smash in the middle—
that spells good-bye.

Don’t ever say “purpose” again, 
let’s throw the word out.

Don’t talk big to me.
I’m carrying my box of faces.
If I want to change faces I will.

Yesterday faded
but tomorrow’s in boldface.

When I grow up my old names 
will live in the house 
where we live now. 
I’ll come and visit them.

Only one of my eyes is tired. 
The other eye and my body aren’t.

Is it true all metal was liquid first?
Does that mean if we bought our car earlier
they could have served it
in a cup? 

There’s a stopper in my arm
that’s not going to let me grow any bigger.
I’ll be like this always, small.

And I will be deep water too.
Wait. Just wait. How deep is the river?
Would it cover the tallest man with his hands in the air?

Your head is a souvenir.

When you were in New York I could see you 
in real life walking in my mind.

I’ll invite a bee to live in your shoe. 
What if you found your shoe 
full of honey?

What if the clock said 6:92
instead of 6:30? Would you be scared?

My tongue is the car wash 
for the spoon.

Can noodles swim?

My toes are dictionaries. 
Do you need any words?

From now on I’ll only drink white milk 
on January 26.

What does minus mean? 
I never want to minus you.

Just think—no one has ever seen 
inside this peanut before!

It is hard being a person.

I do and don’t love you—
isn't that happiness?

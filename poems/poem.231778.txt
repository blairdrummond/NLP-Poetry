Couplet, Ekphrasis

Clora, come view my soul, and tell   
Whether I have contrived it well.   
Now all its several lodgings lie   
Composed into one gallery; 
And the great arras-hangings, made   
Of various faces, by are laid;   
That, for all furniture, you'll find   
Only your picture in my mind. 

Here thou are painted in the dress 
Of an inhuman murderess;   
Examining upon our hearts   
Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:   
Engines more keen than ever yet   
Adorned a tyrant's cabinet; 
Of which the most tormenting are 
Black eyes, red lips, and curled hair. 

But, on the other side, th'art drawn   
Like to Aurora in the dawn; 
When in the East she slumbering lies,   
And stretches out her milky thighs;   
While all the morning choir does sing,   
And manna falls, and roses spring;   
And, at thy feet, the wooing doves   
Sit perfecting their harmless loves. 

Like an enchantress here thou show'st,   
Vexing thy restless lover's ghost;   
And, by a light obscure, dost rave   
Over his entrails, in the cave;   
Divining thence, with horrid care,   
How long thou shalt continue fair; 
And (when informed) them throw'st away, 
To be the greedy vulture's prey. 

But, against that, thou sit'st afloat   
Like Venus in her pearly boat. 
The halcyons, calming all that's nigh,   
Betwixt the air and water fly;   
Or, if some rolling wave appears,   
A mass of ambergris it bears. 
Nor blows more wind than what may well   
Convoy the perfume to the smell. 

These pictures and a thousand more 
Of thee my gallery do store 
In all the forms thou canst invent   
Either to please me, or torment:   
For thou alone to people me,   
Art grown a numerous colony;   
And a collection choicer far 
Than or Whitehall's or Mantua's were. 

But, of these pictures and the rest, 
That at the entrance likes me best:   
Where the same posture, and the look   
Remains, with which I first was took:   
A tender shepherdess, whose hair 
Hangs loosely playing in the air,   
Transplanting flowers from the green hill,   
To crown her head, and bosom fill.

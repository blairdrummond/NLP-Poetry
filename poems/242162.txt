I.
  
 Black swollen fruit dangling on a limb
 Red forgotten flesh sprayed across the prairie
 Parched brown vines creeping over the wall
 Yellow winged pollen, invisible enemies
  
 Boluses without homesteads, grubs without a voice
 Burrowed deeply into this land’s dark, dark heart
 Someday, our pods and pupae shall turn in the earth
 And burgeon into our motherlode’s bold beauty
  
  
 II.
  
 We’re a seed on the manure, on the sole of your shoe
 We’re the louse trapped in your hank of golden hair
 We’re the sliver that haunts beneath your thumbnail
 We the church mouse you scorched with a match but lived
  
 We’re the package wrapped, return address unknown
 We’re the arm lowered again, again, a bloodied reverie
 We’ve arrived shoeless, crutchless, tousle-haired, swollen-bellied
 We shall inherit this earth’s meek glory, as foretold
  
  
 II. (For Leah, my niece)
  
 They gave you a title, but you were too proud to wear it
 They gave you the paterland, but you were too lazy to farm it
  
 Your condo is leaking, but you’re too angry to repair it
 Your dress has moth holes, but you’re too sentimental to toss it
  
 You’re too bored to play the lute, it hangs on the wall like an ornament
 The piano bites you, it’s an eight-legged unfaithful dog
  
 Love grows in the garden, but you’re too impudent to tend it
 A nice Hakka boy from Ogden, so hardworking, so kind
  
 The prayer mat is for prayer, not for catamite nipple-piercing
 The Goddess wags her finger at your beautiful wasteland
  
 A dream deferred, well, is a dream deferred
  
  
 IV. (Janie’s retort, on her fortieth birthday)
  
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun pecks her heat at the horizon
 The same housing tract, the same shopping center
 The same blunt haircut: Chinese, Parisian, Babylonion
 The same lipstick: red and it comes off on your coffeecup
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun tarries in the late noon sky
 The same word for mom: Ah ma, madre, mere, majka
 The same birthbabe: bald, purplish, you slap to make cry
 The same stench: mother’s milk, shit and vomit
 The same argument between a man and a woman
 The same dog, hit by a car, the same escaped canary
 The same turkey for Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year
 The same three-tiered freeway: Istanbul, Tokyo, San Diego
 The same hill, the same shanty town, the same lean-to
 The same skyscraper: Hong Kong, Singapore, Toledo
 The same soup: chicken, though the veggies may vary
 The same rice for supper: white, brown or wild
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun dips her head into the ocean
 The same tree in the same poem by the same poet
 The same old husband: saggy breasts, baggy thighs
 The same blackness whether we sleep or die
  
  
 V.
 Whoever abandoned her grandmother at the bus stop
 Whoever ran in and out the door like a blind wind
    spinning the upside-down prosperity sign right side up again
 Whoever lost her virtue    in darkly paneled rooms    with white boys
 Whoever prayed for round eyes
    and taped her eyelids in waiting
 Whoever wore platform shoes
    blustering taller than her own kind
 Whoever sold her yellow gold for Jehovah
 Whoever discarded her jade Buddha for Christ
  
  
 VI.
 Why are you proud, father, entombed with the other woman?
 Why are you proud, mother, knitting my shroud in heaven?
 Why are you proud, fish, you feed the greedy mourners?
 Why are you proud, peonies, your heads are bowed and weighty?
 Why are you proud, millennium, the dialect will die with you?
 Why are you proud, psalm, hammering yourself into light?

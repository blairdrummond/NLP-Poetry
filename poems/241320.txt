text : 
The casseroles just showed up.
 According to her sister a symbolic casting
  
 of the feminine, not gender but physics, dear—
 according to a friend she looked
  
 just like her sister, green bathrobe mid-afternoon,
 suitcase still in the trunk.
  
 She’d carried him dead for days.
 Out above the reeds a sphere of birds
  
 stretches and knots, rises as one
 brown then belly-white. Oh the hunger
  
 when it came filled every chair.

title : My Hair

When I gather my long 
leaf-colored hair 
and make of it a stem 

and twist the handle of my head 
and join it back to me 
with metal pins 

I’m on your lap again 
my hands are in the air 
my view is mile upon mile 

I feel you fashioning the serpent 
on my head and the thick braid 
of you inside me 

I’m ready now to enter 
a prim public place 
where I am the teacher the police a saint 

I turn my back 
and everyone I command 
sees what it can be to be commanded

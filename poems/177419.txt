Maybe a sin, indecent for sure—dope,   
The storekeeper called it. Everyone agreed   
That Manuel Lawrence, who drank   
Through the side of his mouth, squinting   
And chortling with pleasure, was hooked;   
Furthermore, Aunt Brenda, 
Who was so religious that she made 
Her daughters bathe with their panties on,   
Had dubbed it “toy likker, fool thing,” 
And so might I be, holding the bottle   
Out to the light, watching it bristle.   
Watching the slow spume of bubbles 
Die, I asked myself, could it be alive? 

When they electrocuted Edwin Dockery,   
He sat there like a steaming, breathing   
Bolt, the green muscles in his arms   
Strained at the chair’s black straps, 
The little finger of his right hand leapt up,   
But the charge rose, the four minutes 
And twenty-five hundred volts of his death,   
Which in another month will be   
Thirty-five years old. So the drink fizzed   
With the promise of mixtures to come. 

There it was. If the hard-shell 
Baptists of Alabama are good and content   
That the monster has died, so am I.   
I swallowed. Sweet darkness, one thing   
Led to another, the usual life, waking   
Sometimes lost, dried blood in the ear,   
Police gabbling in a strange language.   
How else would I ever gauge 
How pleasure might end, walking   
Past midnight in the vague direction   
Of music. I am never satisfied.

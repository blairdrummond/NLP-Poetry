title : The Legend

author : Garrett Hongo

text : 
In Chicago, it is snowing softly 
and a man has just done his wash for the week.   
He steps into the twilight of early evening,   
carrying a wrinkled shopping bag   
full of neatly folded clothes, 
and, for a moment, enjoys 
the feel of warm laundry and crinkled paper, 
flannellike against his gloveless hands.   
There’s a Rembrandt glow on his face, 
a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek   
as a last flash of sunset 
blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street. 

He is Asian, Thai or Vietnamese, 
and very skinny, dressed as one of the poor   
in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw,   
dingy and too large. 
He negotiates the slick of ice 
on the sidewalk by his car, 
opens the Fairlane’s back door, 
leans to place the laundry in, 
and turns, for an instant, 
toward the flurry of footsteps 
and cries of pedestrians 
as a boy—that’s all he was— 
backs from the corner package store 
shooting a pistol, firing it, 
once, at the dumbfounded man 
who falls forward, 
grabbing at his chest. 

A few sounds escape from his mouth,   
a babbling no one understands 
as people surround him 
bewildered at his speech. 
The noises he makes are nothing to them.   
The boy has gone, lost 
in the light array of foot traffic 
dappling the snow with fresh prints. 
Tonight, I read about Descartes’ 
grand courage to doubt everything 
except his own miraculous existence 
and I feel so distinct 
from the wounded man lying on the concrete   
I am ashamed. 

Let the night sky cover him as he dies. 
Let the weaver girl cross the bridge of heaven   
and take up his cold hands.

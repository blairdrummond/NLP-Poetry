text : 
Were I to fall in love all over again, it would be 
with this low ceiling, with the calm  faces 
of  the two men going about their craft, 
and with her, now twisting towards them, 
beautiful, defiant and free. 

Because we forget how beauty was once itself 
and nothing else, how it held its stellar 
moment in attic and cellar. 

Because that is what beauty is, this compact 
with time and the silence of  concentration 
on one subversive operation, 

that requires courage and sacrifice 
and never comes without a price.

title : The Future of Terror / 5

If there were gamebirds in our gables, 
shouldn’t we shoot them ourselves? 
Thus we went glass-faced into glory.   
We had our hearts set on staying here, 
so our steps seemed more hesitation 
waltz than straight-ahead tango.   
We danced the hokey pokey on holy days— 
put your left arm in heaven, your right leg in hell 
and in the hubbub of shake-it-all-about, 
we didn’t hear the hoofbeats. The illuminati 
spoke to us over the intercom via interpreters. 
Meanwhile we had iodine dribbling from 
our wounds and itch mites in our blankets. 
Ours was not a job to joke about.   
In the lantern-light, the lawn speckled 
with lead looked lovely. We would live this 
down by living it up. My pile of looseleaf 
was getting smaller—I wrote in margins,   
through marmalade stains, on the backs of maps.   
I put a piece of mica in the microwave and before 
the explosion it made the mirage I’d imagined. 
I was hoping for a noticeable increase in nutmeats 
or a one night stand in the oubliette. I outwept 
everyone at the pageant, even the children 
from the poorhouse playing possum. 
We studied the protocol for astronaut removal 
the minute we saw his spit hit planet earth 
on the spaceship window. But though the scandal 
reverberated round-the-clock, we had to let it 
slide. He was up there turning somersaults 
while we spun ever-so-slowly below.

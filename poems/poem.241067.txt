I lie here thinking of you:--
  
 the stain of love 
 is upon the world!
 Yellow, yellow, yellow
 it eats into the leaves,
 smears with saffron
 the horned branches that lean
 heavily
 against a smooth purple sky!
 There is no light
 only a honey-thick stain
 that drips from leaf to leaf
 and limb to limb
 spoiling the colors
 of the whole world--
  
 you far off there under
 the wine-red selvage of the west!

At San Raffaele Arcangelo
One angel got it all wrong.
 She plopped into this
 sad century feet first
 in her dark clothes.
 There wasn't much water
 that winter—just a few
 puddles really—
 to break her fall.
 Mud-splattered, she rose
 and shook like a canine.
 It didn't take long
 to see her soaked wings
 as a backdrop to all
 the nonmagic to which we were
 accustomed, or to see
 what passed for history
 as a forgetting of sorts.
 (Was that one or two wars?)
 Strange how, as she limped
 down a dim vicolo,
 some willful disc hovered
 above her more florid
 than a sky—how the putrid
 puddles with their last
 reflections could neither
 correct nor register that light.

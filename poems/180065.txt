title : Apiary viii (For the ones

author : Carol Frost

text : 
who line the corridors and sit 
silent in wheelchairs 
before the television with the volume off, 
whose cares 
are small and gray and infinite, 
time as ever to be faced    ... 
Methuselahs the nurses wash 
and dress without haste — 
none needed    ... 
this one has drunk from the poppy-cup 
and drowses in her world of  dream    ... 
Heliotrope, 
carnations, wakeful violets, and lilies in vases — 
masses of  flowers — wrap 
the urine-and-antiseptic air in lace    ... 
Please wake up; it is morning; 
robins whistle; the bees dance. 
Isn't this other one listening 
from her shell of  silence, 
and shouldn't she smile at the green return 
and dappled light through windows? 
As earth orbits the corridor 
clocks are wound    ... 
The last hour is a song or wound    ... 
Except in this corridor — mother's — 
where finity's brainless wind 
blows ash, and ash again 
blows through their cells: 
So much silence, so little to say in the end.)

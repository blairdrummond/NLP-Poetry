and hue 

to have unheld a scale— 

silver dishes little mirrors on their chains— 

they go that way, This 

         and hoist 

It’s not like looking into a pool, 
to let your intelligence run away with you 

Come back quarter size, apricot moon 

A changeling is a child who 
appeared under cover 
of the ordinary, in exchange 

The morning came 
                  I have such pretty handwriting 
                  no one said but I myself thought it 
                  to myself so I matted it 
                  like the grasses or a canvas or some 
                  uncombed hair. It became a mess 
                  which was the research of where things go. 

A child could figure it out 

if there is such a thing as “out” 

in the sense of being figured 
               in 

the thinking was like Origami, 
everyone folded out of birds, into specific 

kinds of birds 
         I call you       
                            hickory 

                            category 

                            dot

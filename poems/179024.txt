title : Cold Spring

author : Lawrence Raab

text : 
The last few gray sheets of snow are gone,   
winter’s scraps and leavings lowered   
to a common level. A sudden jolt 
of weather pushed us outside, and now   
this larger world once again belongs to us.   
I stand at the edge of it, beside the house,   
listening to the stream we haven’t heard   
since fall, and I imagine one day thinking   
back to this hour and blaming myself 
for my worries, my foolishness, today’s choices   
having become the accomplished 
facts of change, accepted 
or forgotten. The woods are a mangle 
of lines, yet delicate, yet precise, 
when I take the time to look closely. 
If I’m not happy it must be my own fault.   
At the edge of the lawn my wife 
bends down to uncover a flower, then another.   
The first splurge of crocuses. 
And for a moment the sweep and shudder   
of the wind seems indistinguishable   
from the steady furl of water 
just beyond her.

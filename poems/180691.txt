I. 

Given to sweet motion 
the wilderness believes 
one fair one of flowers 
to be a moral blossom. 
We go so far. Walks now, 
only legend remaining. 

"I came afterwards to the window when you was writing." 

But in their documents 
her judges had written 
                                    "Insolent." 

In its branches 
spirit shelters 
air with wailing. 
The air thunders 
unavailingly there. 

"Fear is a snare. Why should I be afraid." 

                            If I was in error 
                            but not mistaken, 
                            if my glass was gone 
                            but not broken 
                                              (defaced) 

2. 

My path illuminates 
all the interior of 
a dusky mirror, the 
left shoulder higher 
than the right is in 
memory's intricate. 

We must study distinctions aftertimes will adore. 
if the glass be taken away, we shall see more. 

God is going. Walks now, only God remaining. 


                           (wanting) 
an immediate promise He will deliver them 
(wanting)         in a day of trouble 

These emotions she retained 
in the universal heart, in 
a new eye: rational charity 
                              active piety 
                              appearing as blindness appears 
                              in the face in bright sunlight 
                              exactly like a smile. 


3. 

"Here is a great stir about graces 
and looking to hearts, but give me 
Christ. Tell me not of meditations 
and duties, but tell me of Christ." 
Christ is one thing. The soul is another 
the wild outskirt 
of the earth will 
prove the ruin of. 

And mischief, the poor babe, grew in the forest. 
                                              (defaced) 

A stick a bunch of rags a flower 
need no transformation. The hour 
given to sweet motion is a soul. 

I came to the window when God was going. 
In low condition, 
little number and 
remoteness things 

                           outbreaks of temper 
                           had a kind of value 
                           and even a comfort. 


4. 

A memory a promise or a flower sheared away 
was not made 
                     but taken from a bush of wild roses. 
Seeing them, she began to cry out for a red rose. 

"God has left me to distinguish 
between the voice of my Beloved 
and John Baptist and Antichrist." 
But daybreak unites what belongs together, 
and there are two kinds of distinction. 
There are (something wanting) 

"What he declares he does not know himself." 

I know a day of small 
and a day of infancy. 
At the window vividly 
just now and entirely 
inarticulate the form 
given to sweet motion 

broke apart and 
                         there's colors all 
kinds all round. 

5. 

Of realities surrounding us, 
their pith and substance was 
                                           wasted 
                                           wronged 
                                           misplaced. 

"I desire to speak to our teacher." 

                                           In a state of desire, 
                                           what belongs together 
                                           ignores the barriers. 

Daybreak 
have you 
any word 
your own 
or I one 
fair one 
remaining? 

God is gone, only a window and a wilderness 
remaining, not made but taken, 
thinnest fantasy of beginnings 

taken from a bush of wild red roses.

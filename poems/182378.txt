title : Vincent, Homesick for the Land of Pictures

Is this what you intended, Vincent 
that we take our rest at the end of the grove 
nestled into our portion beneath the bird’s migration 
saying, who and how am I made better through struggle. 
Or why am I I inside this empty arboretum 
this inward spiral of whoop ass and vision 
the leafy vine twisting and choking the tree. 
O, dear heaven, if you are indeed that 
or if you can indeed hear what I might say 
heal me and grant me laughter’s bounty 
of eyes and smiles, of eyes and affection. 

To not be naive and think of silly answers only 
not to imagine answers would be the only destination 
nor is questioning color even useful now 
now that the white ray in the distant tree beacons. 
That the sun can do this to us, every one of us 
that the sun can do this to everything inside 
the broken light refracted through leaves. 
What the ancients called peace, no clearer example 
what our fathers called the good, what better celebration. 
Leaves shine in the body and in the head alike 
the sun touches deeper than thought. 

O to be useful, of use, to the actual seen thing 
to be in some way related by one’s actions in the world. 
There might be nothing greater than this 
nothing truer to the good feelings that vibrate within 
like in the middle of the flower I call your name. 
To correspond, to be in equanimity with organic stuff 
to toil and to reflect and to home and to paint 
father, and further, the migration of things. 
The homing action of geese and wood mice. 
The ample evidence of the sun inside all life 
inside all life seen and felt and all the atomic pieces too. 

But felt things exist in shadow, let us reflect. 
The darkness bears a shine as yet unpunished by clarity 
but perhaps a depth that outshines clarity and is true. 
The dark is close to doubt and therefore close to the sun 
at least what the old books called science or bowed down to. 
The dark is not evil for it has indigo and cobalt inside 
and let us never forget indigo and the warmth of that 
the warmth of the mind reflected in a dark time 
in the time of pictures and refracted light. 
Ah, the sun is here too in the polar region of night 
the animal proximity of another and of nigh. 

To step into it as into a large surf in late August 
to go out underneath it all above and sparkling. 
To wonder and to dream and to look up at it 
wondrous and strange companion to all our days 
and the toil and worry and animal fear always with us. 
The night sky, the deep sense of space, actual bodies of light 
the gemstone brushstrokes in rays and shimmers 
to be held tight, wound tighter in the act of seeing. 
The sheer vertical act of feeling caught up in it 
the sky, the moon, the many heavenly forms 
these starry nights alone and connected alive at the edge. 

Now to think of the silver and the almost blue in pewter. 
To feel these hues down deep, feel color wax and wane 
and yellow, yellows are the tonality of work and bread. 
The deep abiding sun touching down and making its impression 
making so much more of itself here than where it signals 
the great burning orb installed at the center of each and every thing. 
Isn’t it comforting this notion of each and every thing 
though nothing might be the final and actual expression of it 
that nothing at the center of something alive and burning 
green then mint, blue then shale, gray and gray into violet 
into luminous dusk into dust then scattered now gone. 

But what is the use now of this narrow ray, this door ajar 
the narrow path canopied in dense wood calling 
what of the striated purposelessness in lapidary shading and line. 
To move on, to push forward, to take the next step, to die. 
The circles grow large and ripple in the hatch-marked forever 
the circle on the horizon rolling over and over into paint 
into the not near, the now far, the distant long-off line of daylight. 
That light was my enemy and one great source of agony 
one great solace in paint and brotherhood the sky and grass. 
The fragrant hills spoke in flowering tones I could hear 
the gnarled cut stumps tearing the sky, eating the sun.

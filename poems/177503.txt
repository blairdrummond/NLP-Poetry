title : from Stanzas in Meditation: Stanza XIII

author : Gertrude Stein

text : 
There may be pink with white or white with rose 
Or there may be white with rose and pink with mauve 
Or even there may be white with yellow and yellow with blue 
Or even if even it is rose with white and blue 
And so there is no yellow there but by accident.

This season for us, the Jews— 
a season of candles,
                                      one more 
on the seven-branched candlestick for 
the seven days of the week,
                                                  but let it be seven 
in the sense of luck in dice,
                                          seven of the stars in 
the constellations:
                                  Orion, Aldebaran in the sky
                                                                                     lively
over Jerusalem
                               Let the fuel 
last the besieged       such as we are,
                                                             to nourish
us.
        Let the oil continue 
for heat, for illumination,
                                                flame crouching 
in the lamp,
                      the glass smoky
                                                   (December upon us) 
the light not fail.
                               The air has been mild 
for days—
                  & the 7 rings through my life 
despite the 8 of this week—
                                                     bushes 
in the doorway of 7 Charles where I lived, 51, 
crackle with dryness,
                                         are bare still. 
That house with the lucky 
number brought me luck & misluck, both,
                                                                        like the other
that added to 7, out of 4 & 3,
                                                    that seven 
underlying the eight of this week, 
the 8 just over, the 7 just under 
a third of the years with Stefan:
                                                          I praise them
both today—
                        the lasting oil 
in the seven-branched candlestick:
                                                                absence 
of all fear—the smallest 
drop of fuel enough to leap from.

title : Calling the White Donkey

author : Ray Gonzalez

I called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder
 the last time it appeared, ramming me
 with its ivory head, cracking my back
 to relieve me of worry and hope.
 I called the white donkey,
 surprised at the sound of my voice.
 Scared, I wondered if the white head
 would give me its donkey brain,
 snowy matter dripping into my ears
 like the horse of the first man who fell off,
 the donkey teaching me about desire
 and the moan, that white hair on the back
 of my head that warns me.
  
 I called the donkey.
 I came slowly toward me,
 huge ears shaking with fury,
 its breath turning the air white
 as it bit into the white apple
 of my throat.
 I faced the donkey, watched 
 its gait become a shuffle of possession,
 shaking its head as it stopped to
 root its dirty hoofs in the ground.
  
 I stepped back and clicked my fingers,
 but it would not come closer, its snort
 commanding I listen as it farted.
 I walked away and did not know it was
 I who yearned for labor of the ass
 because the animal I summoned
 couldn’t remove the white scar from
 my heart, a blind life I lived for good.

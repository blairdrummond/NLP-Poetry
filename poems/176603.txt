title : The Executive’s Death

author : Robert Bly

text : 
Merchants have multiplied more than the stars of heaven.   
Half the population are like the long grasshoppers   
That sleep in the bushes in the cool of the day; 
The sound of their wings is heard at noon, muffled, near the earth. 
The crane handler dies; the taxi driver dies, slumped over   
In his taxi. Meanwhile high in the air an executive   
Walks on cool floors, and suddenly falls. 
Dying, he dreams he is lost in a snowbound mountain   
On which he crashed, carried at night by great machines.   
As he lies on the wintry slope, cut off and dying,   
A pine stump talks to him of Goethe and Jesus.   
Commuters arrive in Hartford at dusk like moles   
Or hares flying from a fire behind them, 
And the dusk in Hartford is full of their sighs. 
Their trains come through the air like a dark music, 
Like the sound of horns, the sound of thousands of small wings.

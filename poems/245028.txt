text : 
THE NIGHT THAT LORCA COMES
 SHALL BE A STRANGE NIGHT IN THE
 SOUTH, IT SHALL BE THE TIME WHEN NEGROES LEAVE THE 
 SOUTH
         FOREVER,
 GREEN TRAINS SHALL ARRIVE
 FROM RED PLANET MARS
 CRACKLING BLUENESS SHALL SEND TOOTH-COVERED CARS FOR
 THEM
 TO LEAVE IN, TO GO INTO
 THE NORTH FOREVER, AND I SEE MY LITTLE GIRL MOTHER
 AGAIN WITH HER CROSS THAT
 IS NOT BURNING, HER SKIRTS
 OF BLACK, OF ALL COLORS, HER AURA
 OF FAMILIARITY. THE SOUTH SHALL WEEP
 BITTER TEARS TO NO AVAIL,
 THE NEGROES HAVE GONE
 INTO CRACKLING BLUENESS.
 CRISPUS ATTUCKS SHALL ARRIVE WITH THE BOSTON
 COMMONS, TO TAKE ELISSI LANDI
 NORTH, CRISPUS ATTUCKS SHALL
 BE LAYING ON BOSTON COMMONS,
 ELISSI LANDI SHALL FEEL ALIVE
 AGAIN. I SHALL CALL HER NAME
 AS SHE STEPS ON TO THE BOSTON
 COMMONS, AND FLIES NORTH FOREVER,
 LINCOLN SHALL BE THERE,
 TO SEE THEM LEAVE THE
 SOUTH FOREVER, ELISSI LANDI, SHE WILL BE 
 GREEN.
 THE WHITE SOUTH SHALL GATHER AT
 PRESERVATION HALL.

1 
My God! I know, I feel thee mine, 
   And will not quit my claim 
Till all I have is lost in thine, 
   And all renewed I am. 

                        2 
I hold thee with a trembling hand, 
   But will not let thee go 
Till steadfastly by faith I stand, 
   And all thy goodness know. 

                        3 
When shall I see the welcome hour 
   That plants my God in me! 
Spirit of health, and life, and power, 
   And perfect liberty! 

                        4 
Jesu, thine all-victorious love 
   Shed in my heart abroad! 
Then shall my feet no longer rove, 
   Rooted and fixed in God. 

                        5 
Love only can the conquest win, 
   The strength of sin subdue 
(Mine own unconquerable sin), 
   And form my soul anew. 

                        6 
Love can bow down the stubborn neck, 
   The stone to flesh convert; 
Soften, and melt, and pierce, and break 
   An adamantine heart. 

                        7 
Oh, that in me the sacred fire 
   Might now begin to glow, 
Burn up the dross of base desire, 
   And make the mountains flow! 

                        8 
Oh, that it now from heaven might fall, 
   And all my sins consume! 
Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call, 
   Spirit of burning, come! 

                        9 
Refining fire, go through my heart, 
   Illuminate my soul; 
Scatter thy life through every part, 
   And sanctify the whole. 

                        10 
Sorrow and sin shall then expire, 
   While, entered into rest, 
I only live my God t'admire-- 
   My God forever blest. 

                        11 
No longer then my heart shall mourn, 
   While purified by grace 
I only for his glory burn, 
   And always see his face. 

                        12 
My steadfast soul, from falling free, 
   Shall then no longer move; 
But Christ be all the world to me, 
   And all my heart be love.

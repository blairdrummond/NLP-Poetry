sound opens sound 


shank of globe             strings floating out 



                something like images are here 

                opening up avenues to view a dome 


       a distant clang reaches the edifice. 


                               


                understanding what it means 
                to understand music 

       cloudless movement   beyond the neck’s reach 

       an hypnotic lull in porcelain   water break   mimics 

       tonality   crunch of salad under waddling 

                a small seizure 
                from monumentality 

                does not come or go   with understanding 


       the path will end 

       birdhouse    of trembling cotton 


       or dream   expelled it   

       parcel   on the landlocked moor. 


                               


                              explaining music 

       and their clothes entangled 

       who walk into a puddle of minnows; 

                      minnows in a bowl 

       consonant with water. 

the drifted footpad 


       ambushed by reeds signals the listening 

       oars. 

                              music disappears into oars. 


                               


       in the middle the world is brown; 

       on the opposite side of the earth 

       an aroma of scarlet. 


       this accompanies our hearing music; 

       the sleeve of heaven 

       and the hoof of earth 

       loosed from their garrison. 


       dissonance may abandon miserere 

       on bruised knee hasten to the idol.   


                               


       and what is consonance—the recluse— 


       entering and exiting    

       as often as a monarch butterfly   

       touches a season; 


       by accident grips the burning flowers. 


       in the stops between terror 

       the moon aflame on its plaza. 


                               


       autumn of rippling wind 

       and the noise of baskets 

       smell of tin fists. 


       and harsh fists   

       on the waterfall changing the season; 

       the horse romps in flax 

       a cardboard feature 

       creating a cycle of flax. 


               music imagines this cardboard 


       horse in cardboard jacket 

               flagrant the ragged grove 


                              red summit red. 


       dissonance royal traveller 


                              altered the red saddle.

Rhymed Stanza

I should be dumb before thee, feathered sage!
   And gaze upon thy phiz with solemn awe, 
But for a most audacious wish to gauge
   The hoarded wisdom of thy learned craw.

Art thou, grave bird! so wondrous wise indeed? 
   Speak freely, without fear of jest or gibe--
What is thy moral and religious creed?
   And what the metaphysics of thy tribe?

A Poet, curious in birds and brutes,
   I do not question thee in idle play;
What is thy station? What are thy pursuits? 
   Doubtless thou hast thy pleasures--what are they? 

Or is't thy wont to muse and mouse at once,
   Entice thy prey with airs of meditation, 
And with the unvarying habits of a dunce,
   To dine in solemn depths of contemplation?

There may be much--the world at least says so--
   Behind that ponderous brow and thoughtful gaze; 
Yet such a great philosopher should know,
   It is by no means wise to think always.

And, Bird, despite thy meditative air,
   I hold thy stock of wit but paltry pelf--
Thou show'st that same grave aspect everywhere, 
   And wouldst look thoughtful, stuffed, upon a shelf.

I grieve to be so plain, renowned Bird--
   Thy fame's a flam, and thou an empty fowl; 
And what is more, upon a Poet's word
   I'd say as much, wert thou Minerva's owl.

So doff th' imposture of those heavy brows;
   They do not serve to hide thy instincts base--
And if thou must be sometimes munching mouse, 
   Munch it, O Owl! with less profound a face.

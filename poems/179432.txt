title : Hymn

author : A. R. Ammons

text : 
I know if I find you I will have to leave the earth
 and go on out
      over the sea marshes and the brant in bays
 and over the hills of tall hickory
 and over the crater lakes and canyons
 and on up through the spheres of diminishing air
 past the blackset noctilucent clouds
            where one wants to stop and look
 way past all the light diffusions and bombardments
 up farther than the loss of sight
     into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark
  
 And I know if I find you I will have to stay with the earth
 inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes
 trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest
      coelenterates
 and praying for a nerve cell
 with all the soul of my chemical reactions
 and going right on down where the eye sees only traces
  
 You are everywhere partial and entire
 You are on the inside of everything and on the outside
  
 I walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum
 has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut
 and I see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark
 chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down
 and if I find you I must go out deep into your 
     far resolutions
 and if I find you I must stay here with the separate leaves

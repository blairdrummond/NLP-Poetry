"Dullness of words where God speaks. A dark which feels  good. Drawn curtains. On the dark page lines continue the  crease and the dream, the space between."  -Reb Rissel

   "Hope: the following page. Do not close the book." 

   "I have turned all the pages of the book without finding hope." 

   "Perhaps hope is the book."

   "In my dialogues there are no answers. But sometimes a question 
is the flash of an answer. 
   "My route riddled with crystals." 
                                                                            -Reb Librad 



   And Yukel said: 

   "If an answer were possible death would not travel alongside life, 
life would not have a shadow. The universe would be light. 
   "Contradiction is the scream of a soul drawn and quartered by the 
moment. Did not Reb Sedra write: 'Here is grain for your field: a 
grain of life, a grain of death. The grain of life will nourish your death, 
the grain of death feed your life.'" 

                         ("Death will get the better of me. God can only help 
                         me in the void." 
                                                                           -Reb Zeilein)

text : 
Born in a safe family   
But a dangerous area, Iraq,   
I heard guns at a young age, so young   
They made a decision to raise us safe   
So packed our things   
And went far away.   

Now, in the city of rain,   
I try to forget my past,   
But memories never fade.   

This is my life,   
It happened for a reason,   
I happened for a reason.

At focus in the national   
Park’s ellipse a marker   
Draws tight the guys of 

Miles, opposite the national   
Obelisk with its restless oval   
Peoples who shall be 

Deeply drawn to its   
Austerities: or 
For a moment try the mystery 

Of the god-like eye, before   
Our long climb down past relic   
Schoolboy names and states 

And one foolish man   
Climbs up, his death high   
In his elliptic face.

A double highway little   
Used in early spring 
Goes to the end of the land 

Where Washington’s chandeliers   
Are kept, his beds and chairs,   
His roped-off relic kitchen 

Spits, his pans; his floors 
Are worn underneath the dead   
Pilgrims’ feet; outside 

The not-so-visited tomb;   
And over the field and fence   
His legendary river: 

And so I walk although   
The day is cold for this;   
I eat a thin slice 

Of bread and one remarkable   
Egg perfectly shaped,   
A perfect oriental por- 

Celain sheen of white.   
Suddenly the lost   
Ghosts of his life 

Broke from the trees and from the cold   
Mud pools where he played   
A boy and set as a man 

The sand glint of his boot, 
The flick of his coat on the weeds;   
His wheels click in the single road.

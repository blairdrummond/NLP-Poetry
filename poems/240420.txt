That twig of light, that branch, that
                                                 fork, that form.
                 Beyond that, a city. A horse drowning in
         a river, and beyond that, a city. Wildfire, and beyond that,
 a city. God, a slippery thing,
                                  an eel, is twined
                 from our hands. That rainy hum is
        the wharf, is the light that etches a bridge
                                  between pronouns, the bottle
 of amber formaldehyde, the infant
                                                 orangutan, the wing
                 of a gull stitched to its scapula. Here is a river
         drowning in a horse’s dark eye. Devitalized, humming, rainy,
 the feather of this gull, this small
                                                 spill of light,
                 the written thing that glues each hill
         to the earth, that follows a pull with its wobbly needle. God is
 a drowned horse fifty hands at the shoulder. To write what
                                                 convinces with
                 the impossible whisper. After that,
         a city. They call this floating thing an angel and hurry you out
                  of the tent. A bear eating its own paws, and after
                                                  this, a city. A window full
 of smoke, and after this, a city. A meter to measure
                                                                           day and time
 Adapted for that purpose by the God of our hands.

title : A World to Do

author : Theodore Weiss

text : 
“I busy too,” the little boy   
said, lost in his book 
about a little boy, lost 
in his book, with nothing 

but a purple crayon 
and his wits to get him out.   
“Nobody can sit with me,   
I have no room. 
                        I busy 
too. So don’t do any noise.   
We don’t want any noise   
right now.” 
                  He leafs 
through once, leafs twice; 
the pictures, mixed with windy   
sighs, grow dizzy, 
                            world 
as difficult, high-drifting 
as the two-day snow that can   
not stop. 
               How will the bushes,   
sinking deeper and deeper,   
trees and birds, wrapt   
up, ever creep 
                      out again? 
Any minute now the blizzard,   
scared and wild, the animals   
lost in it—O the fur, 

the red-eyed claws, crying   
for their home—may burst   
into the room. Try words   
he’s almost learned 
                              on them? 
He sighs, “I need a man here;   
I can’t do all this work   
alone.” 
            And still, as though   
intent on reading its own   
argument, winter continues   
thumbing through itself.

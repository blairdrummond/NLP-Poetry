title : Destiny

author : Marin Sorescu

text : 
The chicken I bought last night, 
Frozen, 
Returned to life, 
Laid the biggest egg in the world, 
And was awarded the Nobel Prize. 

The phenomenal egg 
Was passed from hand to hand, 
In a few weeks had gone all round the earth, 
And round the sun 
In 365 days. 

The hen received who knows how much hard currency, 
Assessed in buckets of grain 
Which she couldn’t manage to eat 

Because she was invited everywhere, 
Gave lectures, granted interviews, 
Was photographed. 

Very often reporters insisted 
That I too should pose 
Beside her. 
And so, having served art 
Throughout my life, 
All of a sudden I’ve attained to fame 
As a poultry breeder.

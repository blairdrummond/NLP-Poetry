I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -
The Stillness in the Room 
Was like the Stillness in the Air -
Between the Heaves of Storm - 

The Eyes around - had wrung them dry - 
And Breaths were gathering firm 
For that last Onset - when the King 
Be witnessed - in the Room -

I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away 
What portion of me be 
Assignable - and then it was 
There interposed a Fly - 

With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -
Between the light - and me -
And then the Windows failed - and then 
I could not see to see -

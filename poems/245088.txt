title : Robinson Escapes to the Cape for Independence Day

author : Kathleen Rooney

text : 
O little-know facts—how Robinson attracts them!
  
 Pilgrims rocked ashore here, before Plymouth Rock.
  
 The word scrimshaw is of unknown origin.
  
 The stock name of the archaic two-lane main road? Route 6A. Really
 it’s Old King’s Highway.
  
 Some facts are useless: the paper bag was invented in Dennis.
  
 Some facts are not: Wellfleet’s town clock sings out ship’s time.
  
 19th century Americans observed only three holidays. The Fourth of
 July was one.
  
 O witty aperçus—how Robinson accrues them!
  
 Good food is self-made, like a good millionaire.
  
 Don’t just do something. Stand there.
  
 It’s got to be the weekend somewhere.
  
 Robinson is crisp & perspicuous. His wife stands next to him on the
 sand.
  
 Democracy could be a lot more sexy if . . . this one fades in the rockets’
 red glare.
  
 Ann blushes, runs a hand through his hair.
  
 Robinson looks up, concussed.
  
 Fireworks percuss.

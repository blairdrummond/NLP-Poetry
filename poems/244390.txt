Song 1
  
 Julito used to shine the soul
 of his shoes before he left for
 the Palladium to take the wax
 off the floor while Tito Rodriguez
 flew around the walls like a
 parakeet choking maracas
 It was around this time that
 Julito threw away his cape
 because the Umbrella Man and the
 Dragons put the heat on all the
 Ricans who used to fly around
 in Dracula capes swinging canes
 or carrying umbrellas
 Even if there was no rain
 on the horizon
 That same epoca my mother
 got the urge to paint the
 living room pink and buy a
 new mirror with flamingoes
 elegantly on the right hand
 corner because the one we had
 was broken from the time that
 Carlos tried to put some respect
 Into Julito and knock the
 party out of him.
  
  
 Song 2
  
 All the old Chevies that the
 gringoes from upstate New York
 wore out
 Were sailing around the neighborhood
 with dices and San Martin de Porres
 el negrito who turned catholic
 Hanging in the front windows.
  
  
 Song 3
  
 There was still no central heating
 in the tenements
 We thought that the cold was
 the oldest thing on the planet earth
 We used to think about my Uncle Listo
 Who never left his hometown
 We’d picture him siting around
 cooling himself with a fan
 In that imaginary place
 called Puerto Rico.

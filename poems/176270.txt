Good morning kiss. Their teeth glance. Clack of June 
bugs against pane. On the porch a young man 
in the full sun rocking. 
Jars incubate tomato plants. His mother sweeps the dirt 
yard away from flowering vinca and bottle tree. 
Straightens up, one-eyed by ragged hens. As her boy 
ambles away to the steady pulse 
in his skull. 
The cattle gate 
swinging open behind him. 
She takes a headache powder 
and it is nineteen and twenty seven. 
The James overruns its levee, backs up 
the Blackwater. Nineteen and twenty nine: she reads his postcard, 
the tobacco crop burns. Nineteen and thirty, drought. 
Long limp bags drag through fields. The Lord whistles 
for the fly. Revival tents threaten a rain 
of scorpions. To cure her hiccups, 
the woman sees a hypnotist. Promptly 
coughs herself to death. In pungs marked men ride. The son 
is blown away. No one returns in this story. No one escapes. 
The tribe is glued together for ruination, friends. 
There is no more time, there is no way out.

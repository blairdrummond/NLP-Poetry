All the way north on the train the sun   
followed me followed me without moving   
still the sun of that other morning 
when we had gone over Come on over   
men at the screen door said to my father   
You have to see this it’s an ape bring   
the little boy bring the boy along 

so he brought me along to the field 
of dry grass hissing behind the houses   
in the heat that morning and there was   
nothing else back there but the empty day   
above the grass waving as far away 
as I could see and the sight burned my eyes   
white birds were flying off beyond us 

and a raised floor of boards like a house   
with no house on it part way out there   
was shining by itself a color 
of shadow and the voices of the men 
were smaller in the field as we walked on   
something was standing out there on the floor   
the men kept saying Come on over 

it’s on a chain and my father said 
to me Don’t get too close I saw it was   
staring down at each of our faces 
one after the other as though it might   
catch sight of something in one of them 
that it remembered I stood watching its eyes   
as they turned away from each of us

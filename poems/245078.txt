title : Don’t Let Me Be Wistful

author : Dana Ward

text : 
The heat out there this evening
  
 is contained heat like things keep applicable boxes
  
 at the ready then subsume their diverging constituent parts
  
 long ambivalent talks into midnight, all those
  
 glowy Sophia Coppola movies, Prosecco
  
 the sexiest records I know. I don’t feel
  
 how I know anymore to be more than something seeking
  
 my appalling lack of cinematic knowledge, fictive innocence
  
 & something like the break-down of those little boxes
  
 little tombs put their hands up in front of my mouth
  
 there’s a tacitly humiliating eulogy to drown out couldn’t feel
  
 much more stupid about feeling stupid over feeling
  
 stupid, living. Let me go & watch something
  
 moving several images some of them symbolize humility broken
  
 postures bloodshot eyes, intimately talking through this
  
 publicly I am not developing at all but just the same. So hot
  
 outside in the evening heat locking hazy jonquils
  
 & sunflowers dead for two weeks, ridiculously
  
 mournful as I’ll try & dimly think of the last real shock.
  
 I remember disgust perhaps & something like alarm (the phone
  
 going off in the middle of the night) pervasive disappointment
  
 &, for sure, horror, but shock?, as if the heat were seceding from the frames
  
 of its containment thought & feeling & establishing some wonderama
  
 ratios & beanpole features quick to surge beyond the human model.
  
 I know I do the heat out there this evening
  
 will & maybe I should be the one I know who has to stop.
  
 If I have to heal myself completely every time before I start
  
 I shouldn’t be. I think about the god of demurrment in the world
  
 or I think about it later having fallen to its love spell — the heat
  
 keeps me shut up at the table in the evening
  
 at the laptop arranging each letter with the same affectless love
  
 it’s nothing moving Avery born & Vivian to come December
  
 Kermit the Frog sings the Ave Maria while the white flag is endlessly
  
 lowered & raised through the whole master/slave dialectic forever.
  
 Don’t let me be wistful. Let me be the actual heat, forgiven
  
 its severity & leaving for the year. Mercy is just like the children’s zoo it’s real
  
 weird to think about anything now, think how fucking hard
  
 a fucking beach read used to be sewn into its spine
  
 delicious words from start to finish I could just
  
 lay there & die it’s so goddamn nice in this sigh vitrine real 9/11
  
 kind of midnight Friday midnight, lamely shifting in my chair, the fan
  
 that stops the love that moves the world that stops goes out on gold
  
 weeks other weeks it just sits in the back.
  
 It collects statically. I hate that.

Rhymed Stanza, Ballad

O Mary, at thy window be, 
         It is the wish'd, the trysted hour! 
Those smiles and glances let me see, 
         That makes the miser's treasure poor: 
How blythely wad I bide the stoure, 
         A weary slave frae sun to sun, 
Could I the rich reward secure, 
         The lovely Mary Morison. 

Yestreen when to the trembling string 
         The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha' 
To thee my fancy took its wing, 
         I sat, but neither heard nor saw: 
Tho' this was fair, and that was braw, 
         And yon the toast of a' the town, 
I sigh'd, and said amang them a', 
         "Ye are na Mary Morison." 

O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace, 
         Wha for thy sake wad gladly die? 
Or canst thou break that heart of his, 
         Whase only faut is loving thee? 
If love for love thou wilt na gie 
         At least be pity to me shown: 
A thought ungentle canna be 
         The thought o' Mary Morison.

Waking 
on the train, I thought   
we were attacked 

            by light:   
chrome-winged birds   
hatching from the lagoon. 

            That first day   
the buoys were all   
that made the harbor 

            bearable: 
pennies sewn into a hemline.   
Later I learned to live in it, 

            to walk 
through the alien city— 
a beekeeper’s habit— 

            with fierce light   
clinging to my head and hands.   
Treated as gently as every 

            other guest— 
each house’s barbed antennae   
trawling for any kind 

            of weather— 
still I sobbed in a glass box   
on an unswept street 

            with the last 
few lire ticking like fleas 
off my phonecard I’m sorry 

            I can’t 
stand this, which 
one of us do you love?

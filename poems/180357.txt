Once you said joking slyly, If I’m killed 
I’ll come to haunt your solemn bed, 
I’ll stand and glower at the head 
And see if my place is empty still, or filled. 

What was it woke me in the early darkness 
Before the first bird’s twittering? 
—A shape dissolving and flittering 
Unsteady as a flame in a drafty house. 

It seemed a concentration of the dark burning 
By the bedpost at my right hand 
While to my left that no man’s land 
Of sheet stretched palely as a false morning.... 

All day I have been sick and restless. This evening 
Curtained, with all the lights on, 
I start up—only to sit down. 
Why should I grieve after ten years of grieving? 

What if last night I was the one who lay dead 
While the dead burned beside me 
Trembling with passionate pity 
At my blameless life and shaking its flamelike head?

title : Lake Echo, Dear

author : C. D. Wright

text : 
Is the woman in the pool of light   
really reading or just staring   
at what is written 

Is the man walking in the soft rain   
naked or is it the rain   
that makes his shirt transparent 

The boy in the iron cot   
is he asleep or still 
fingering the springs underneath 

Did you honestly believe   
three lives could be complete 

The bottle of green liquid   
on the sill is it real 

The bottle on the peeling sill   
is it filled with green 

Or is the liquid an illusion   
of fullness 

How summer’s children turn   
into fish and rain softens men 

How the elements of summer 
nights bid us to get down with each other   
on the unplaned floor 

And this feels painfully beautiful   
whether or not 
it will change the world one drop

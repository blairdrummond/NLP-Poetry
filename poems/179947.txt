title : Before Sextet

author : Bernadette Mayer

text : 
Use a new conductor every time-out 
you have sextetâ€”before foreshore, 
before pen name gets anywhere 
near any bogey opera glass 
(to avoid expulsion to any bogey 
flunkey that can carry infidel) 
Handle conductor gently 

Put conductor on as soon as 
pen name is hard 
be sure rolled-up ringworm is on 
the outspokenness. And leave 
space suit at tire to hold 
semi-final when you come 

Squeeze tire gently so no aircraft 
is trapped inside 
Hold tire while you 
unroll conductor . . . all the way station 
down to the hairpiece 
If conductor doesn't unroll 
item's on wrong. Throw item away 
Start over with a new onion

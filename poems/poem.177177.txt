To the Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth 
Phillis Wheatley 
1753-1784






Hail, happy day, when, smiling like the morn, 
Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn: 
The northern clime beneath her genial ray, 
Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway: 
Elate with hope her race no longer mourns, 
Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns, 
While in thine hand with pleasure we behold 
The silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold. 
Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies 

She shines supreme, while hated faction dies: 
Soon as appear'd the Goddess long desir'd, 
Sick at the view, she languish'd and expir'd; 
Thus from the splendors of the morning light 
The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night. 
 No more, America, in mournful strain 
Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain, 
No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain, 
Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand 
Had made, and with it meant t' enslave the land. 

 Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song, 
Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung, 
Whence flow these wishes for the common good, 
By feeling hearts alone best understood, 
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate 
Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat: 
What pangs excruciating must molest, 
What sorrows labour in my parent's breast? 
Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd 
That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd: 
Such, such my case. And can I then but pray 
Others may never feel tyrannic sway? 

 For favours past, great Sir, our thanks are due, 
And thee we ask thy favours to renew, 
Since in thy pow'r, as in thy will before, 
To sooth the griefs, which thou did'st once deplore. 
May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give 
To all thy works, and thou for ever live 
Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame, 
Though praise immortal crowns the patriot's name, 
But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane, 
May fiery coursers sweep th' ethereal plain, 
And bear thee upwards to that blest abode, 
Where, like the prophet, thou shalt find thy God.

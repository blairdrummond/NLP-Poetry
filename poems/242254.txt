title : No Epitaph

author : Donald Davie

text : 
﻿No moss nor mottle stains
My parents’ unmarked grave;
My word on them remains
Stouter than stone, you told me.
 
“Martyred to words”, you have thought,
Should be your epitaph;
At other times you fought
My self-reproaches down.
 
Though bitterly once or twice
You have reproached me with how
Everything ended in words,
We both know better now:
 
You understand, I shall not
If I survive you care
To raise a headstone for
You I have carved on air.

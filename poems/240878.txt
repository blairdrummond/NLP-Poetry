title : The Ghost of a Hunter

He reads: What soul suffers in secret, the flesh shows openly.
  
  
     Deep within, in a region hardly accessible, a bold self-image
 sends messages of bloodshed and conquest, which reverberate in
 his heart of hearts.
  
  
     [I forget which hand is writing.]
  
  
     He does not doubt that he exists.
  
  
     The five senses have left their mark on him. It is a record of
 what has happened to him, but he cannot talk or travel until he
 finds a body of water.
  
  
     A man who has lived on reindeer’s flesh amuses himself with
 ripples.
  
  
     In this cage was once a nightingale. In the echo, new words
 for wind.
  
  
     The usual convulsions, and a green cat. And, after all, months
 or years are nothing to him.
  
  
     [My image contains his body.]
  
  
     His body contains bodies.
  
  
     Blemishes.
  
  
     Inglories.
  
     Vague figures, in a howling wind, and with no notion of
 perspective.
  
  
     Of countless ruined worlds, he would appropriate the 
 essential emblem. Wall struggling with wall, shadow with shad-
 ow.
  
  
     Thousands of miles a day.
  
  
     He gazes across an unguarded cemetery—gazes idly, waiting
 for new equipment.
  
  
     As through a fixed window, he finds a kind of space, the
 visible world foreshortened.
  
  
     He does not see deeply, but—still—one thing behind another.
  
  
     He keeps a tiny bird, folded like a sheet of paper.
  
  
     Twice two is four—still—and a circle has no angles.
  
  
     Body sheds shoulder, jaw. However body may appear, the soul
 comes back in scars.
  
  
     [There are no dead. Only names.]
  
  
     Too close, ruin wrinkles the surface—his breath bothers
 reality. The sun pours down. The pots are mended.
  
  
     An unfolding, from where it is all contained.
  
  
     The ships have been salvaged. [I do not know what body he
 has in mind.] Clothing is resumed. Temples are rebuilt.
  
     “Which body?” we inquire, while all the liars cry out,
 “Verily!”
  
  
     As though all this were in the dark.
  
  
     Here is a column of soldiers, a heap of apples, an avenue of
 trees. Here a swarm of bees, of birds, a row of equidistant lines.
 A set of unequal objects distributes the field of vision.
  
  
     Here is the painted world in an actual image. [I have no 
 theory for the clouds he sees.]

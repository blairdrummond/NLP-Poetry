title : Uncouplings

text : 
There is no I in teamwork 
but there is a two maker 

there is no I in together 
but there is a got three 
a get to her 

the I in relationship 
is the heart I slip on 
a lithe prison 

in all communication 
we count on a mimic 
(I am not uncomic) 

our listening skills 
are silent killings 

there is no we in marriage 
but a grim area 

there is an I in family 
also my fail

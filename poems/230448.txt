for Jon and Jill
Eyeing the grass for mushrooms, you will find 
A stone or stain, a dandelion puff
Deceive your eyestheir colour is enough 
To plump the image out to mushroom size 
And lead you through illusion to a rind
That's trueflint, fleck or feather. With no haste 
Scent-out the earthy musk, the firm moist white, 
And, played-with rather than deluded, waste 
None of the sleights of seeing: taste the sight 
You gaze unsure ofa resemblance, too, 
Is real and all its likes and links stay true 
To the weft of seeing. You, to begin with, 
May be taken in, taken beyond, that is,
This place of chiaroscuro that seemed clear, 
For realer than a myth of clarities
Are the meanings that you read and are not there: 
Soon, in the twilight coolness, you will come 
To the circle that you seek and, one by one, 
Stooping into their fragrance, break and gather, 
Your way a winding where the rest lead on 
Like stepping stones across a grass of water.

title : The Paradox of Jeromeâ€™s Lion

author : Christopher Middleton

text : 
Local his discourse, not yet exemplary, 
Nowadays he is old, the translator, 
So old he is practically transparent. 

Good things and otherwise, evils done 
Come home to him, too close to the bone 
And so little transformed, 
Him so transparent, 
They float in and out of his window. 

Killing fields and the pumpkin patch, 
The combat boot putrid in a cherry tree, 
Stroke on stroke the mortal build-up, 
All the constraint, all the letting go, 

So insistent in his attentions 
That he needs a breathing block. 
For lack of a monitor he might levitate, 
The testy old bird, at his wondow; 
He needs an animal, a sure thing, 
One to imagine, at last. Speechless 
As bedrock, a rough reminder of that. 

A dog might be vigilant enough, 
Intact, all heart, a yellow desert dog. 
Avoirdupoids. A leopard? Markings 
Regular, talons to swat 
Any hurt away. Knowing 
Hunger, not the greed. Sufficient 

Unto itself, svelte, clean of limb; 
Free through self-discipline, yes, 
Yes, through self-discipline free, 

And fierce, yet doing no violence 
The wild by right he will restore 
To a holy place, in time. 

For want of that sort of a beast, 
He might make do with a frog.

title : Blue Monday

author : Diane Wakoski

text : 
Blue of the heaps of beads poured into her breasts   
and clacking together in her elbows; 
blue of the silk 
that covers lily-town at night; 
blue of her teeth 
that bite cold toast 
and shatter on the streets; 
blue of the dyed flower petals with gold stamens   
hanging like tongues 
over the fence of her dress 
at the opera/opals clasped under her lips 
and the moon breaking over her head a 
gush of blood-red lizards. 

Blue Monday. Monday at 3:00 and 
Monday at 5. Monday at 7:30 and 
Monday at 10:00. Monday passed under the rippling   
California fountain. Monday alone 
a shark in the cold blue waters. 

                     You are dead: wound round like a paisley shawl.   
                     I cannot shake you out of the sheets. Your name   
                     is still wedged in every corner of the sofa. 

                     Monday is the first of the week,   
                     and I think of you all week.   
                     I beg Monday not to come   
                     so that I will not think of you   
                     all week. 

You paint my body blue. On the balcony 
in the softy muddy night, you paint me 
with bat wings and the crystal 
the crystal   
the crystal 
the crystal in your arm cuts away 
the night, folds back ebony whale skin   
and my face, the blue of new rifles,   
and my neck, the blue of Egypt,   
and my breasts, the blue of sand,   
and my arms, bass-blue, 
and my stomach, arsenic; 

there is electricity dripping from me like cream; 
there is love dripping from me I cannot use—like acacia or   
jacaranda—fallen blue and gold flowers, crushed into the street. 

                         Love passed me in a blue business suit 
                         and fedora. 
                         His glass cane, hollow and filled with 
                         sharks and whales ...   
                         He wore black 
                         patent leather shoes 
                         and had a mustache. His hair was so black 
                         it was almost blue. 

                         “Love,” I said. 
                         “I beg your pardon,” he said.   
                         “Mr. Love,” I said. 
                         “I beg your pardon,” he said. 

                         So I saw there was no use bothering him on the street 

                         Love passed me on the street in a blue   
                         business suit. He was a banker   
                         I could tell. 

So blue trains rush by in my sleep.   
Blue herons fly overhead. 
Blue paint cracks in my 
arteries and sends titanium 
floating into my bones.   
Blue liquid pours down 
my poisoned throat and blue veins 
rip open my breast. Blue daggers tip 
and are juggled on my palms. 
Blue death lives in my fingernails. 

If I could sing one last song 
with water bubbling through my lips 
I would sing with my throat torn open, 
the blue jugular spouting that black shadow pulse,   
and on my lips 
I would balance volcanic rock 
emptied out of my veins. At last 
my children strained out 
of my body. At last my blood 
solidified and tumbling into the ocean. 
It is blue.   
It is blue.   
It is blue.

Amour 30: Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee 
Michael Drayton 
1563-1631
17th Century
England




Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee: 
 That dangerous eye-killing cockatrice, 
 The enchanting siren, which doth so entice, 
 The weeping crocodile--these vile pernicious three. 
 The basilisk his nature takes from thee, 
 Who for my life in secret wait dost lie, 
 And to my heart sendst poison from thine eye: 
 Thus do I feel the pain, the cause, yet cannot see. 
 Fair-maid no more, but Mer-maid be thy name, 
 Who with thy sweet alluring harmony 
 Hast played the thief, and stolen my heart from me, 
 And like a tyrant makst my grief thy game: 
   Thou crocodile, who when thou hast me slain, 
   Lamentst my death, with tears of thy disdain.

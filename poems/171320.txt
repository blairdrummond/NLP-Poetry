title : Yet Do I Marvel

author : Countee Cullen

text : 
I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind, 
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why 
The little buried mole continues blind,   
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die, 
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus 
Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare   
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus 
To struggle up a never-ending stair.   
Inscrutable His ways are, and immune   
To catechism by a mind too strewn   
With petty cares to slightly understand   
What awful brain compels His awful hand.   
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:   
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!

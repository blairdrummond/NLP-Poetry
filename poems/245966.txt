title : Glacial Erratics

author : Brenda Hillman

text : 
The last ice age had been caused by a wobble.
After it passed they made houses from stars;
 
Visitors would peer in
And see the tongs not slipping,


Roomsized pebbles having been moved far.
 
It’s like this more
When we speak than when we write;
 
Loving thus we have been
Loved by ground,
 
The word being
A box with four of its corners hidden;
 
Everything else is round.

text : 
Some prowl sea-beds, some hurtle to a star 
and, mother, some obsessed turn over every stone   
or open graves to let that starlight in. 
There are men who would open anything. 

Harvey, the circulation of the blood, 
and Freud, the circulation of our dreams,   
pried honourably and honoured are   
like all explorers. Men who’d open men. 

And those others, mother, with diseases 
like great streets named after them: Addison,   
Parkinson, Hodgkin—physicians who’d arrive   
fast and first on any sour death-bed scene. 

I am their slowcoach colleague, half afraid,   
incurious. As a boy it was so: you know how   
my small hand never teased to pieces   
an alarm clock or flensed a perished mouse. 

And this larger hand’s the same. It stretches now   
out from a white sleeve to hold up, mother,   
your X-ray to the glowing screen. My eyes look   
but don’t want to; I still don’t want to know.

text : 
Their singer suffered breakdowns. In their work
 there was a sense of what it was to live there at that time.
 One song described the dark around the military
 vehicles between them and the cocaine waiting
 in Gramercy. It was about the sepsis that followed love
 or love repeated as farce, the neck neck neck
 damaged by an anonymous hand unstringing guitars.
 They got away with it and worked to abolish youth
 by knitting and paying half-attention. I thought I was
 in love because my sentiments were matched
 by a generic, abiding sense of unfreedom. Nothing
 survives lovers descrying the red flags of old flames.
 Nothing is more relatable than an unreasonable person
 operating subtractively, indulgently, out of exasperation.ï»¿

Rhymed Stanza

Sorrow like a ceaseless rain
      Beats upon my heart.
People twist and scream in pain, ?
Dawn will find them still again;
This has neither wax nor wane,
      Neither stop nor start.

People dress and go to town;
      I sit in my chair.
All my thoughts are slow and brown:
Standing up or sitting down
Little matters, or what gown
      Or what shoes I wear.

title : In the Goddess’s Name I Summon You. . .

author : George Seferis

Oil on limbs, 
maybe a rancid smell 
as on the chapel’s 
oil-press here, 
as on the rough pores 
of the unturning stone. 

Oil on hair 
wreathed in rope 
and maybe other scents 
unknown to us 
poor and rich 
and statuettes offering 
small breasts with their fingers. 

Oil in the sun 
the leaves shuddered 
when the stranger stopped 
and the silence weighed 
between the knees. 
The coins fell: 
‘In the goddess’s name I summon you...’ 

Oil on the shoulders 
and the flexing waist 
legs grass-dappled, 
and that wound in the sun 
as the bell rang for vespers 
as I spoke in the churchyard 
with a crippled man.

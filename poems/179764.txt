title : Early December in Croton-on-Hudson

author : Louise Glück

text : 
Spiked sun. The Hudson’s 
Whittled down by ice. 
I hear the bone dice 
Of blown gravel clicking. Bone- 
pale, the recent snow 
Fastens like fur to the river. 
Standstill. We were leaving to deliver 
Christmas presents when the tire blew 
Last year. Above the dead valves pines pared 
Down by a storm stood, limbs bared . . . 
I want you.

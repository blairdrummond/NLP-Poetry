title : Hardy’s Catalogues

author : Anne Winters

text : 
Fleeing his clubs, dull honors, wives, the ageing Hardy 
hunches down in his potting-shed with his thumbtip-fumbled, fine- 
printed seed catalogue’s inflorescences— 
peripherally glimpsing the oxygenless blue line 

of the fleur-de-lys scaling his inner wrist; 
his chalky knuckles, his forearm’s crisp, lisse, 
pleated wrinkles; softly brown-spotted 
as a fox terrier’s belly. Yet this pleases, only this— 

age-speckled surfaces, sun-galls rose-speckled; puckering 
petals rugosely leaf-veined: the saturate, flooded 
stemlines’ mauves and verdures on the backlit 

catalogue’s tissuelike (nearly self-composting) 
pages—like his skin, all milliner-ribboned; yet with, barely hooded, 
things as they are and will be visible beneath it.

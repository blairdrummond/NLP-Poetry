1. 
 Let us think of God as a lover
        Who never calls,
 Whose pleasure in us is aroused
        In unrepeatable ways,
 God as a body we cannot
        Separate from desire,
 Saying to us, “Your love
        Is only physical.”
 Let us think of God as a bronze
        With green skin
 Or a plane that draws the eye close
        To the texture of paint.
 Let us think of God as life,
        A bacillus or virus,
 As death, an igneous rock
        In a quartz garden.
 Then, let us think of kissing
        God with the kisses
 Of our mouths, of lying with God,
        As sea worms lie,
 Snugly petrifying
        In their coral shirts.
 Let us think of ourselves
        As part of God,
 Neither alive nor dead,
        But like Alpha, Omega,
 Glyphs and hieroglyphs,
        Numbers, data.
  
  
 2.
 First forgive the silence
        That answers prayer,
 Then forgive the prayer
        That stains the silence.
  
 Excuse the absence
        That feels like presence,
 Then excuse the feeling
        That insists on presence.
  
 Pardon the delay
        Of revelation,
 Then ask pardon for revealing
        Your impatience.
  
 Forgive God
        For being only a word,
 Then ask God to forgive
        The betrayal of language.
  
 3.
 God of the Syllable
        God of the Word
 God Who Speaks to Us
        God Who Is Dumb
  
 The One God  The Many
        God the Unnameable
 God of the Human Face
        God of the Mask
  
 God of the Gene Pool
        Microbe  Mineral
 God of the Sparrow’s Fall
        God of the Spark
  
 God of the Act of God
        Blameless  Jealous
 God of Surprises
        And Startling Joy
  
 God Who Is Absent
        God Who Is Present
 God Who Finds Us
        In Our Hiding Places
  
 God Whom We Thank
        Whom We Forget to Thank
 Father God   Mother
        Inhuman Infant
  
 Cosmic Chthonic
        God of the Nucleus
 Dead God   Living God
       Alpha God    Zed
  
 God Whom We Name
        God Whom We Cannot Name
 When We Open Our Mouths
        With the Name God   Word God
  
  
 4.
 The new day cancels dread
        And dawn forgives all sins,
 All the judgments of insomnia,
        As if they were only dreams.
  
 The ugly confrontation
        After midnight, with the mirror,
 Turns white around the edges
        And burns away like frost.
  
 Daylight undoes gravity
        And lightness responds to the light.
 The new day lifts all weight,
        Like stepping off into space.
  
 Where is that room you woke to,
        By clock-light, at 3 a.m.?
 Nightmare’s many mansions,
        Falling, have taken it with them.
  
 The new day, the day’s newness,
        And the wretchedness that, you thought,
 Would never, never depart,
        Meet—and there is goodbye.
  
 A bad night lies ahead
        And a new day beyond that—
 A simple sequence, but hard
        To remember in the right order.
  
 5. 
 Lord of dimensions and the dimensionless,
 Wave and particle, all and none,
  
 Who lets us measure the wounded atom,
 Who lets us doubt all measurement,
  
 When in this world we betray you
 Let us be faithful in another.

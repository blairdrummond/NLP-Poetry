title : Daniel

author : David Orr

text : 
On the day we moved in, the pings, bumps, and snaps 
Were scary, it's true, but probably normal; 
A house accepting new patterns of weight 
With protest, the way no conviction goes gently. 
We laughed a little, and called it "our spirit." 

Later that night, when the power conked out 
And the kids were crying, the ghost got a name, 
"Daniel," and a history of whispered exploits, 
All of them harmless, like nursery rhymes, 
Or like the little fibs we tell ourselves 
To explain why this or that has led to suffering. 

Pretty soon, we were using him for everything. 
When the Christmas tree fell, it was "Daniel"; 
When my wife lost her ring, it was "Daniel"; 
When the kids forgot to feed the goldfish 
And it turned up dead, its eyes silvered over 
Like water shadowed under sheets of ice, 

Well, that became Daniel too, which was curious; 
And pauses me now as I make the long walk 
Down the hall to the bathroom in darkness, 
And hear, in soft concert, the sound of my footfalls 
Answered at once by my children's voices 

Still calling to Daniel behind their door.

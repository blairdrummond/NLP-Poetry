Nudes--stark and glistening, 
Yelling in lurid glee. Grinning faces 
And raging limbs 
Whirl over the floor one fire. 
For a shirt verminously busy 
Yon soldier tore from his throat, with oaths 
Godhead might shrink at, but not the lice. 
And soon the shirt was aflare 
Over the candle he'd lit while we lay. 

Then we all sprang up and stript 
To hunt the verminous brood. 
Soon like a demons' pantomime 
The place was raging. 
See the silhouettes agape, 
See the gibbering shadows 
Mixed with the battled arms on the wall. 
See gargantuan hooked fingers 
Pluck in supreme flesh 
To smutch supreme littleness. 
See the merry limbs in hot Highland fling 
Because some wizard vermin 
Charmed from the quiet this revel 
When our ears were half lulled 
By the dark music 
Blown from Sleep's trumpet.

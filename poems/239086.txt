title : The Coffins

author : Michael Chitwood

text : 
Two days into the flood 
they appear, moored against 
a roof eave or bobbing caught 
in the crowns of drowned trees. 
Like fancy life boats 
from an adventurerâ€™s flag ship, 
brass plating and grips, 
walnut sheen, scroll work, 
they slip through the understory 
on this brief, bad river. 
What have they discovered 
and come back to account? 
Or is this the beginning 
of the marvelous voyage 
and they plan never to return?

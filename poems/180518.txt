title : Sand Flesh and Sky

author : Clarence Major

text : 
Our ropes are the roots 
of our life. We fish 
low in the earth, 
the river beneath runs through our veins, 
blue and cold in a riverbed. 

When the sun comes up, 
the moon moves slowly to the left. 

I tie the logs and limbs together, 
holding them in place. 

The ocean beats them 
smooth like rock. 
Here my sense of time is flat. 

I find in a strip of damp sand 
footprints and marks of hands, 
and torn pieces of flesh. 

Night is a beast. 
The tide moves, gushing 
back and forth. 

Sunlight touches our faces, 
turning us, turning us, turning us 
in our morning sleep.

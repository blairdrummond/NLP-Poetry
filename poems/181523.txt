title : Pine

The first night at the monastery, 
a moth lit on my sleeve by firelight, 
long after the first frost. 

A short stick of incense burns 
thirty minutes, fresh thread of pine 
rising through the old pine of the hours. 

Summer is trapped under the thin 
glass on the brook, making 
the sound of an emptying bottle. 

Before the long silence, 
the monks make a long soft rustling, 
adjusting their robes. 

The deer are safe now. Their tracks 
are made of snow. The wind has dragged   
its branches over their history.

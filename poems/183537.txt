title : In the Cannery the Porpoise Soul

author : Juan Felipe Herrera

text : 
In the cannery the porpoise soul 
& the shadow fins of spirit boats lie awake 
the hundred hooks & flying reels 
one harpoon 
& the silver fleshing in the nets 

the mayor is waiting/counting scales 
dreaming new quotas & tuna coasts 
(under the table blood & payrolls 
swim to the shores on a crucifix of oil) 

in the cannery the porpoise soul 
steals a dagger for the engines throat 
tuna fins etch an X 
on the green stone of the ships floor 

there are documents with worker sweat 
files & rolled sleeve salt 
a spear of sails & anchor years 
(lost) 
inside the shoulders & against the ropes 
(somehow) 
a policy gunned the waves back 
before the porpoise sea was born

title : Betrayal

author : Andrea Hollander

text : 
They decide finally not to speak 
of it, the one blemish in their otherwise 
blameless marriage. It happened 
 
as these things do, before the permanence 
was set, before the children grew 
complicated, before the quench 
 
of loving one another became all 
each of them wanted from this life. 
Years later the bite 
 
of not knowing (and not wanting 
to know) still pierces the doer 
as much as the one to whom it was done: 
 
the threadbare lying, the insufferable longing, 
the inimitable lack of touching, the undoing 
undone.

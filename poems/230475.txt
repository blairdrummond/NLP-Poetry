Federico Garcia Lorca 
used to uncork a 
bottle or two of wine 
whenever the duende dwindled for a line. 

James Joyce 
would have preferred a choice 
of brandies in decanters made by Tiffany’s,   
but rotgut was the shortcut to epiphanies. 

The Later Henry James 
bet shots of rum against himself in games   
of how much can we pyramid upon a   
given donné. 

Little Dylan Thomas 
didn’t keep his promise 
to stay out of Milk Wood. 
He tried to drown the fact as best he could. 

Anna Akhmatova 
Eyed the last shot of a 
Pre-war cognac de champagne. 
“So much for you, little brandy. Do svidanya.” 

T. S. Eliot 
used to belly it 
up to the nearest bar, 
then make for a correlative objective in his car. 

Proust   
used 
to 
too.

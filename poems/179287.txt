—on my seventy-ninth birthday
Nobody in the widow’s household   
ever celebrated anniversaries.   
In the secrecy of my room 
I would not admit I cared 
that my friends were given parties.   
Before I left town for school 
my birthday went up in smoke   
in a fire at City Hall that gutted   
the Department of Vital Statistics.   
If it weren’t for a census report   
of a five-year-old White Male   
sharing my mother’s address 
at the Green Street tenement in Worcester   
I’d have no documentary proof   
that I exist. You are the first,   
my dear, to bully me 
into these festive occasions. 

Sometimes, you say, I wear 
an abstracted look that drives you   
up the wall, as though it signified   
distress or disaffection. 
Don’t take it so to heart. 
Maybe I enjoy not-being as much   
as being who I am. Maybe 
it’s time for me to practice 
growing old. The way I look 
at it, I’m passing through a phase:   
gradually I’m changing to a word.   
Whatever you choose to claim   
of me is always yours; 
nothing is truly mine 
except my name. I only 
borrowed this dust.

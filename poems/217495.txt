title : Shell

author : Harriet Brown

text : 
I found it in the wash, the orange 
shell I picked up on the beach 
that last time. One of my girls— 
the one named after you— 

must have found it in my room 
and wanted it. Clean calcareous 
curve, a palm open to nothing, 
reeking of sunshine 

and your death. For years 
I didn't know what to do with it. 
You would have liked 
this story: how a child 

slips grief into a careless pocket. 
Breaks it to pieces. Lets it go.

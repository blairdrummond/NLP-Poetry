title : Call Me Pier

author : Susan Firer

text : 
I have just returned from a visit to my pier 
Often I am permitted to return to my pier 
For a long time I would go to pier early 
So much depends upon a pier 
This is an old pier 
I celebrate my pier, and what I assume . . . 
I had a pier 
There is a certain slant of pier 
On woman's first disobedience, and the pier 
Christmas won't be Christmas without the pier 
I wandered lonely as a pier 
Pier was spiteful 
This is just to say I have eaten the pier

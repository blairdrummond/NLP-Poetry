					Men are trading their bullets for worms. “I spent a lifetime building.”   We come down from the mountains. We brought eggs, a table, a windowshade. There were times when we couldn’t bring anything. So many people.   As you were walking up the hill and I was walking down, we almost passed each other. But I grasped your arm and backed up. You said: “This is what I look like now.”﻿

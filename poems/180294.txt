text : 
As I am Catholic 
I have never played. 

*       *       * 

I've had 
thirty-six lovers 
plus tax. 

*       *       * 

I am the most chaste woman 
in Italian literature. 

*       *       * 

I am completely 
asexual 
not counting errors 
and omissions. 

*       *       * 

Mount Sinai 
is sometimes confused 
with the Mons Veneris. 

*       *       * 

No one can know 
what is 
between me and God.

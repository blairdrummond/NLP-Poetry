title : Romance

author : Edgar Allan Poe

text : 
Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
With drowsy head and folded wing, 
Among the green leaves as they shake 
Far down within some shadowy lake, 
To me a painted paroquet 
Hath been—a most familiar bird— 
Taught me my alphabet to say— 
To lisp my very earliest word 
While in the wild wood I did lie, 
A child—with a most knowing eye. 
Of late, eternal Condor years 
So shake the very Heaven on high 
With tumult as they thunder by, 
I have no time for idle cares 
Through gazing on the unquiet sky. 
And when an hour with calmer wings 
Its down upon my spirit flings— 
That little time with lyre and rhyme 
To while away—forbidden things! 
My heart would feel to be a crime 
Unless it trembled with the strings.

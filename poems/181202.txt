—for Tamar Craig
I knew the hard winter of sapphires 
set within gold claws, 
amber and pipestone strung on gut, 
fringed pouches stuffed with hash. 
Separate, separate, I urged her 
that summer of Woodstock, 
when I lied to get the car 
and draped my love beads 
around the neck of someone else’s sister. 

In a hayloft in Ohio 
my friend lifted three bales 
to show me a litter of week-old kittens, 
each pair of eyes infected with a slimy mucus. 
Their pupils swam in opaque opal membranes 
and they would have gone blind 
if she had not pulled an eyedropper 
of antibiotics from her jacket, 

doing what the mother cat 
could not do, what the owners 
would not trouble themselves to do, 
doing what a sister or friend 
might do if she took the time 
to attend the wayward, opalescent 
unhappiness in this world.

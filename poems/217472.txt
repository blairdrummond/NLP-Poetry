title : Dismantling the House

author : Stephen Dunn

text : 
Rent a flatbed with a winch. 
With the right leverage 
anything can be hoisted, driven off. 

Or the man with a Bobcat comes in, 
then the hauler with his enormous truck. 
A leveler or a lawyer does the rest; 

experts always are willing to help. 
The structure was old, rotten in spots. 
Hadn't it already begun to implode? 

Believe you've just sped the process up. 
Photographs, toys, the things that break 
your heartâ€”let's trust 

they would have been removed, 
perhaps are safe with the children 
who soon will have children of their own. 

It's over. It's time for loss to build 
its tower in the yard where you 
are merely a spectator now. 

Admit you'd like to find something 
discarded or damaged, even gone, 
and lift it back into the world.

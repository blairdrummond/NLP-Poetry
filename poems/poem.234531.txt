Rhymed Stanza

When Israel came from Egypt's coast, 
   And Goshen's marshy plains, 
And Jacob with his joyful host 
   From servitude and chains; 

Then was it seen how much the Jews 
   Were holy in his sight, 
And God did Israel's kingdom choose 
   To manifest his might. 

The sea beheld it, and with dread 
   Retreated to make way; 
And Jordan to his fountain head 
   Ran backwards in dismay. 

The mountains, like the rams that bound, 
   Exulted on their base; 
Like lambs the little hills around 
   Skipt lightly from their place. 

What is the cause, thou mighty sea, 
   That thou thyself should shun; 
And Jordan, what is come to thee, 
   That thou should backward run? 

Ye mountains that ye leaped so high 
   From off the solid rock, 
Ye hills that ye should gambols try, 
   Like firstlings of the flock? 

Earth, from the center to the sod 
   His fearful presence hail 
The presence of Jeshurun's God, 
   In whom our arms prevail. 

Who beds of rocks in pools to stand 
   Can by his word compel, 
And from the veiny flint command 
   The fountain and the well.

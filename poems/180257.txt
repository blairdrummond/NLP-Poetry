I 

A score of years ago I felled a hundred pines to build a house. 

Two stories, seven rooms in all. 
                                              I built my love a home. 
                                                                                 Our 
daughter was in orbit in the womb. 
                                                   Mountains spun off like the arm 
of a galaxy into the emptiness our windows framed. 
                                                                           "What a 
view!" our friends exclaimed, and "Sunsets to die for every single night!"

Vertigo of solitude, distillate of loneliness for blood, my wife 
untrue, my daughter flown, I, like a widower or worse, move 
among the rooms I made. 
                                     Where once I was not alone, now each 
closed door is panic, and spaces grow immense with memory, like 
shadows at dusk. 
                         Gone that arrangement of allegiances called family 
we never really know before it ends. 
                                                      Like love itself, it isn't true till 
then. 
       I have no family now but remembrences of tiny joys, tinier 
dramas we used to call our life, like pollen over everything: brightly 
colored clothespins on the line, a cross-shaped coral earring whose 
match is lost, books of fairy tales we read aloud at night. 
                                                                                  I must be 
dumb as a gunnysack of hammers. 
                                                   Wind still blows through open 
windows like it always used to do. 
                                                 What did I love that made me 
believe it would last?

title : Man with a Black Dog

author : Richard Emil Braun

text : 
The first commotion stirred him to offend,   
forgivably, with friendly leaps and clutching;   
but soon too urgent friendliness was wrought   
by a new wave of guests. At last I complained   
to that one man that it was indecent 
of him to tempt the beast so, pressing his   
tweed knee against the furry brisket. But 
he smiled, and spoke with a Rhinelandish accent: 

Milady, your youth, as mine did me, tends   
you now to the younger beliefs of men,   
their naive symbols: cloudy animal heads   
to represent witless rampages of glands.   
Egyptian Hershef, Seth, Ra—the romance   
of anonymity above the neck 
and smooth humanity below—were gods   
of early hankering and youthful conscience. 

See how the shaggy thing turns back his ears;   
the straining mouth and eyes’ protuberance   
leave me my steady vision and clear speech   
and mind. The aegipans, surely the centaurs   
are truer concepts of the dual beast 
and a maturer Hellas sculpted them: 
potentially ironic man above 
and hairy vitality below the waist. 
No one, Milady, no lover on earth 
does other than what I am doing now, 
methodically tempting the brute, till from 
the dim sheath an eager lick of flame darts forth.

I 

Because I was born in a kingdom, 
there was a king. At times 
the king was a despot; at other times, 
not. Axes flashed in the road 

at night, but if you closed your eyes 
and sang the old ballads 
sitting on the well edge 
amongst your kinspeople 
then the silver did not appear 
to be broken.    

Such were the circumstances. 
They made a liar out of me. 
Did they change my spirit?   
Kith in the night   
the sound of owls. A bird fight. 

II 

We also had a queen, 
whetted by the moon. And 
we her subjects, 
softening in her sight. 

III 

What one had   
the other had to 
have too. Soon   
parrots bloomed 
in every garden, and   
every daughter 
had a tuning fork   
jeweled with emeralds. 

IV 

Learning to hunt in the new empire, 
the king invited his subjects 
to send him their knives. 
He tested these knives on oranges, 
pomegranates, acorn squash, 
soft birches, stillborns, prisoners 
who had broken rules. He used them 
on the teeth of traitors. 

V 

When strangers massed at the borders, 
the courtiers practiced   
subjection of the foreign. The court   
held a procession   
of twine, rope, 
gold, knife, light, and 
prostitutes with their vials of white 
powder. Smoke coursed into the courtyard, 
and we wrought hunger upon 
the bodies of strangers. I am sure you 
can imagine 
it, really what need   
is there for me to tell you? 
You were a stranger once too, and I 
brought rope. 

VI 

Afterward, I always slept, 
and let the dealers   
come to me alone 
with jewels. 

VII   

In the court at night, we debated 
the skin of language, 
questioned what might 
one day be revealed inside: 
a pink and soft fruit, 
a woman in a field. . . 
Or a shadow, sticky and loose 
as old jam. Our own   
dialect was abstract, 
we wished to understand 
not how things were 
but what spectacle we might   
make from them. 

VIII 

One day a merchant 
brought moving pictures,   
the emperor's new delight.   
He tacked dark cloth to all   
the windows, top   
and bottom, and turned 
the lights off, cranking the machine like 
a needle and thread 
making forms into which 
we could insinuate our cold 
bodies and find warmth. Light; dark. 
And the sliding images of courtiers 
merrily balancing pineapples 
on their heads, as if this   
were an adequate story. 

IX 

And our queen, that hidden 
self. What became 
of her? Slid into the night 
like a statue, and felt 
around into shadows, 
nothing to prove, all worldly 
latitudes, knowing as a spider 
in retreat. The web 
her mind, and in it, the fly. 

X 

On Sundays, we flew kites   
to ensure our joy 
was seen by all those who   
threatened 
to threaten us. The thread 
spooling out up high   
in the purple sky 
and silver gelatin films being made, 
sliding through the cranking machine 
so that the barbarians could know 
we made images of ourselves 
coated in precious metal 
and sent them away 
indifferent to our wealth. 

I miss the citrus   
smell of spring 
on the plaza filled 
with young 
and long-limbed kite flyers. 

XI 

Do I have anything else 
to add? Only that 
I obeyed my king, my 
kind, I was not faithless. 
Should I be punished 
for that? It is true   
some of my pictures creak unhappily 
through the spindle. 
It is true one day they 
came to my house. I know   
the powder we coated our fingers 
with made us thirsty 
and sometimes cruel. But I was born 
with a spirit like you. 
I have woken, you see, 
and I wish to be   
made new.

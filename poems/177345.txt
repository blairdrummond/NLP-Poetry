title : More Blues and the Abstract Truth

author : C. D. Wright

text : 
I back the car over a soft, large object; 
hair appears on my chest in dreams. 
The paperboy comes to collect 
with a pit bull. Call Grandmother 
and she says, Well you know 
death is death and none other. 

In the mornings we’re in the dark; 
even at the end of June 
the zucchini keep on the sill. 
Ring Grandmother for advice 
and she says, O you know 
I used to grow so many things. 

Then there’s the frequent bleeding, 
the tender nipples, and the rot 
under the floormat. If I’m not seeing 
a cold-eyed doctor it is 
another gouging mechanic. 
Grandmother says, Thanks to the blue rugs 
and Eileen Briscoe’s elms 
the house keeps cool. 

Well. Then. You say Grandmother 
let me just ask you this: 
How does a body rise up again and rinse 
her mouth from the tap. And how 
does a body put in a plum tree 
or lie again on top of another body 
or string a trellis. Or go on drying 
the flatware. Fix rainbow trout. Grout the tile. 
Buy a bag of onions. Beat an egg stiff. Yes, 
how does the cat continue 
to lick itself from toenail to tailhole. 
And how does a body break 
bread with the word when the word 
has broken. Again. And. Again. 
With the wine. And the loaf. 
And the excellent glass 
of the body. And she says, 
Even. If. The. Sky. Is. Falling. 
My. Peace. Rose. Is. In. Bloom.

For Geoff Dyer his front yard is the true Benares      -- Devara Dasimayya,           tr. A.K. Ramanujan
His death in Benares
Won't save the assassin 
From certain hell,

Any more than a dip
In the Ganges will send
Frogs--or you--to paradise.

My home, says Kabir,
Is where there's no day, no night,
And no holy book in sight

To squat on our lives.

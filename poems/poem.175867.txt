Secret Waters 
Eva Gore-Booth 
1870-1926

Ireland
Faith & Doubt



Lo, in my soul there lies a hidden lake,
High in the mountains, fed by rain and snow, 
The sudden thundering avalanche divine, 
And the bright waters' everlasting flow, 
Far from the highways' dusty glare and heat. 
Dearer it is and holier, for Christ's sake, 
Than his own windy lake in Palestine, 
For there the little boats put out to sea 
Without him, and no fisher hears his call, 
Yea, on the desolate shores of Galilee 
No man again shall see his shadow fall. 
Yet here the very voice of the one Light 
Haunts with sharp ecstasy each little wind 
That stirs still waters on a moonlit night,
And sings through high trees growing in the mind,
And makes a gentle rustling in the wheat. . . .
Yea, in the white dawn on this happy shore, 
With the lake water washing at his feet,
He stands alive and radiant evermore,
Whose presence makes the very East wind kind, 
And turns to heaven the soul's green-lit retreat.

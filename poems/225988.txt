title : On the Lawn at the Villa

author : Louis Simpson

text : 
On the lawn at the villa— 
That’s the way to start, eh, reader? 
We know where we stand—somewhere expensive— 
You and I imperturbes, as Walt would say, 
Before the diversions of wealth, you and I engagés. 

On the lawn at the villa 
Sat a manufacturer of explosives,   
His wife from Paris, 
And a young man named Bruno, 

And myself, being American, 
Willing to talk to these malefactors, 
The manufacturer of explosives, and so on, 
But somehow superior. By that I mean democratic. 
It’s complicated, being an American, 
Having the money and the bad conscience, both at the same time.   
Perhaps, after all, this is not the right subject for a poem. 

We were all sitting there paralyzed 
In the hot Tuscan afternoon, 
And the bodies of the machine-gun crew were draped over the balcony. 
So we sat there all afternoon.

title : His Sovereignty

author : Kalonymos ben Moses of Lucca

text : 
His sovereignty is o’er my gathered throng;
 His glory is my faith within,
 I seek Him for atonement of my sin—
 This day of fasting to forgive the wrong:
 And He will answer, He will say, “Forgiven.”
  
 Holy—and mighty in His chamber o’er the skies;
 Holy—in penitence alone His pardon lies;
 Holy—the secret of His Law He tells His own
 Holy—for all His sheep rejoicing to atone;
 Holy—He pardoneth His faithful one that pleads;
 Holy—and all His people praise His mighty deeds;
 Holy—His faithful one remembering in His love;
 Holy—He loves the soul’s affliction of His dove.
 Holy—on those unclean His cleansing waters flow;
 Holy—His people’s sin He maketh white as snow.
 Holy—yea, Israel of their error maketh clear;
 Holy—He sets apart one day in all the year;
 Holy—He pardons them whose longing turns to Him.
 Holy—above the highest heights He standeth dim;
 Holy—and He is good to those who bear His fear;
 Holy—forgiving sin His wrath will not appear;
 Holy—by righteousness He drives transgressions hence;
 Holy—He holds this day of fast for penitence.
 Holy—He gently leads to Him His holy one;
 Holy—thus merciful beside Him there is none;
 Holy—’mid clouds abiding where His dwelling lies:
 Holy—and angels tell His glory through the skies.
  
 His sovereignty is o’er my gathered throng;
 His glory is my faith within.
 I seek Him for atonement of my sin—
 This day of fasting to forgive the wrong:
 And He will answer, He will say, “Forgiven.”

 Somewhere Indians are walking across America.
 One is a woman caught in stride
 between two white birches, her eyes
 on the ground, her mouth
 biting open a word while the wind
 shreds the lake behind her.

 A boy wakes alone in cold New England air.
 From his window he watches his father’s breath
 mix with the steam from cows’ urine.
 A white blanket of sheep has unrolled
 across the hill, and the yellow dogs
 who ran and ran have now disappeared.

 A glass necklace floats on her white breast
 just as she herself floats inside his lens
 while he watches from under the dark hood—
 her small black eardrops hang perfectly still,
 her long white neck and cleavage ready to be
 frozen forever by the touch of his finger.

 As the deer ate from the deep lawn
 and the fish jumped near the willow trees,
 the big white ferry paused briefly before sliding
 back again across the lake, completely
 unaware of its brightness and its beauty.

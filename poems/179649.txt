title : You Were You Are Elegy

author : Mary Jo Bang

text : 
Fragile like a child is fragile. 
Destined not to be forever. 
Destined to become other 
To mother. Here I am 
Sitting on a chair, thinking 
About you. Thinking 
About how it was 
To talk to you.
How sometimes it was wonderful 
And sometimes it was awful.
How drugs when drugs were 
Undid the good almost entirely 
But not entirely 
Because good could always be seen 
Glimmering like lame glimmers 
In the window of a shop 
Called Beautiful 
Things Never Last Forever. 
I loved you. I love you. You were. 
And you are. Life is experience. 
It's all so simple. Experience is 
The chair we sit on. 
The sitting. The thinking 
Of you where you are a blank 
To be filled 
In by missing. I loved you. 
I love you like I love 
All beautiful things. 
True beauty is truly seldom. 
You were. You are 
In May. May now is looking onto 
The June that is coming up. 
This is how I measure 
The year. Everything Was My Fault 
Has been the theme of the song 
I've been singing, 
Even when you've told me to quiet. 
I haven't been quiet. 
I've been crying. I think you 
Have forgiven me. You keep 
Putting your hand on my shoulder 
When I'm crying. 
Thank you for that. And 
For the ineffable sense 
Of continuance. You were. You are 
The brightest thing in the shop window
And the most beautiful seldom I ever saw.

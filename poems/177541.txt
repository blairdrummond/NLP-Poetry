This misalliance 
follows the custom 
for female children 
To adhere to maternal practices 

While the atheist father presides over   
the prattle of the churchgoer 
with ironical commentary    from his arm-chair 

But by whichever 
religious route 
to brute 
reality 
our forebears speed us 

There is often a pair 
of idle adult 
accomplices in duplicity 
to impose upon their brood 

an assumed acceptance   
of the grace of God 
defamed as human megalomania 

seeding the Testament 
with inconcievable chastisement 

and of Christ 
who 
come with his light 
of toilless lilies 
To say “fear 
not   it is I” 
wanting us to be fearful 

He who bowed the ocean tossed   
with holy feet 
which supposedly dead 

are suspended over head   
neat- 
ly crossed in anguish   
wounded with red 
varnish 

From these 
slow-drying bloods of mysticism   
mysteriously 
the something-soul emerges   
miserably 

and instinct (of economy)   
in every race 
for reconstructing debris   
has planted an avenging face   
in outer darkness 

              . . . 

The lonely peering eye   
of humanity 
looked into the Néant   
      and turned away 

              . . . 

Ova’s consciousness 
impulsive to commit itself to justice   
—to arise and walk 
its innate     straight way 
out of the 
accidence of circumstance— 

collects the levitate chattels   
of its will and makes for the   
magnetic horizon of liberty   
with the soul’s foreverlasting   
opposition 
to disintegration 

So this child of Exodus 
with her heritage of emigration 
often 
“sets out to seek her fortune” 
in her turn 
trusting to terms of literature 
dodging the breeders’ determination 
not to return “entities sent on consignment”   
by their maker Nature 
except in a condition 
of moral 
effacement 

Lest Paul and Peter   
never 
notice the creatures   
ever had had Fathers   
and Mothers 

They were disgraced in their duty 
should such spirits 
take an express passage 
through the family bodies 
to arrive at Eternity 
as lovely     as they originally   
promised 

So on whatever days 
she chose to “run away” 
the very 
street corners of Kilburn 
close in upon Ova 
to deliver her 
into the hands of her procreators 

Oracle of civilization 
‘Thou shalt not live by dreams alone   
but by every discomfort 
that proceedeth out of 
legislation’

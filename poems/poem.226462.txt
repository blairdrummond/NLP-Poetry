Sonnet

While summer roses all their glory yield 
   To crown the votary of love and joy, 
   Misfortune's victim hails, with many a sigh, 
   Thee, scarlet Poppy of the pathless field, 
Gaudy, yet wild and lone; no leaf to shield 
   Thy flaccid vest that, as the gale blows high, 
   Flaps, and alternate folds around thy head. 
   So stands in the long grass a love-crazed maid, 
Smiling aghast; while stream to every wind 
   Her garish ribbons, smeared with dust and rain; 
   But brain-sick visions cheat her totured mind, 
And bring false peace. Thus, lulling grief and pain, 
   Kind dreams oblivious from thy juice proceed, 
   Thou flimsy, showy, melancholy weed.

New York’s lovely weather 
                                                    hurts my forehead 

                                                   in praise of thee 
                                                                               the? white dead 
                                                                               whose eyes know: 
                           what are they 
    of the tiny cloud my brain:
 The City’s tough red buttons: 
                                                                   O Mars, red, angry planet, candy 

                                                                                 bar, with sky on top, 
                             “why, it’s young Leander hurrying to his death” 
                 what? what time is it in New York            in these here alps 
        City of lovely tender hate 
                                                             and beauty making beautiful 
                                                                                                   old rhymes? 
  I ran away from you 
when you needed something strong 
                   then I leand against the toilet bowl (ack) 
         Malcolm X 
                             I love my brain 
         it all mine now is 
         saved not knowing 
                      that & 
                      that (happily) 
                      being that: 

                      “wee kill our selves to propagate our kinde” 
                                                                                                 John Donne 
    yes, that’s true 
                          the hair on yr nuts & my 
                                      big blood-filled cock are a part in that 
                               too 

                                                PART 2 
                                     Mister Robert Dylan doesn’t feel well today 
                                    That’s bad 
                                    This picture doesn’t show that 
                                    It’s not bad, too 

                                    it’s very ritzy in fact 

                                    here I stand I can’t stand 
                                    to be thing 
                                    I don’t use                            atop 
                                                          the empire state 
                                                          building 
                                                          & so sauntered out that door 
That reminds me of the time 
I wrote that long piece about a gangster name of “Jr.” 
O Harry James! had eyes to wander but lacked tongue to praise 
                                                             so later peed under his art 
                 paused only to lay a sneeze 
                                                                                      on Jack Dempsey 
                                                                      asleep with his favorite Horse 
                           
                             That reminds me of I buzz 
                                           on & off Miró pop 
                                           in & out a Castro convertible 
           minute by minute                                           GENEROSITY! 
          
          Yes now that the seasons totter in their walk 
          I do a lot of wondering about Life      in praise of ladies dead of 
& Time plaza(s), Bryant Park by the Public                     eye of brow 
Library, Smith Bros. black boxes, Times 
                                                 Square 
                                             Pirogi Houses 
                                                                       with long skinny rivers thru them 
                                                      they lead the weary away 
                                                                   off! hey! 
                                                                                  I’m no sailor 
                                                                                off a ship 
                                                                                                         at sea   I’M HERE 
                                                                                                  & “The living is easy” 
It’s “HIGH TIME” 
                                                     & I’m in shapes 
                                                     of shadow, they 
                                                     certainly can warm, can’t they? 

                 Have you ever seen one?                                                NO! 
                                                            of those long skinny Rivers 
                                                                 So well hung, in New York City 
                                          NO!          in fact 
                                                                        I’m the Wonderer 
& as yr train goes by                               forgive me, René!              ‘just oncet’ 
I woke up in Heaven 
                                        He woke, and wondered more, how many angels 
      on this train huh?                      snore 

                                                                    for there she lay 
                                   on sheets that mock lust                  done that 7 times 
                                                                                                  been caught 
                                                                           and brought back 
                                                              to a peach nobody. 

                                         To Continue: 
                                         Ron Padgett & Ted Berrigan 
                                                  hates yr brain 
                                                                my dears 
                                                            amidst the many other little buzzes 
                                       & like, Today, as Ron Padgett might say 
                                                               is 
                                                  “A tub of vodka” 
                                                                                “in the morning” 
                         she might reply 
and that keeps it up 
          past icy poles 
                                           where angels beg fr doom then zip 
                                                    ping in-and-out, joining the army
                      wondering about Life 
                             by the Public Library of 
                                                                        Life
                                                                                       No Greater Thrill! 
                                                             (I wonder) 

Now that the earth is changing I wonder what time it’s getting to be
                  sitting on the New York Times Square 
          that actually very ritzy, Lauren    it’s made of yellow wood or 
                                                     I don’t know something               maybe 
                                  This man was my                       it’s been fluffed up 
                                       friend 
                                                          He had a sense for the 
                                                                 vast                               doesn’t he? 
                                               
                                                Awake my Angel! give thyself 
                                                          to the lovely hours        Don’t cheat 
                                      The victory is not always to the sweet. 
                                                         I mean that. 

Now this picture is pretty good here 
Though it once got demerits from the lunatic Arthur Cravan 
He wasn’t feeling good that day 
Maybe because he had nothing on 
                                                                    paint-wise I mean 


                                                         PART 3 

                                                        I wrote that 
                                                               about what is 
                                             this empty room            without a heart 
                                                          now in three parts 
                                                   a white flower 
                                                  came home wet & drunk                2 Pepsis 
                                                  and smashed my fist thru her window 
                                                                                               in the nude 
            As the hand zips you see 
                                      Old Masters, you can see 
                               well hung in New York              they grow fast here 
                                    Conflicting, yet purposeful 
                                              yet with outcry vain! 


                                                        PART 4 

                                                      Praising, that’s it! 
you string a sonnet around yr fat gut 
          and falling on your knees 
                                                        you invent the shoe 
                                                        for a horse. It brings you luck 
                                              while sleeping 
                                                        “You have it seems a workshop nature” 
Have you                                              “Good Lord!” 
                                                                                        Some folks is wood 
seen them?                                          Ron Padgett wd say 
                                                                    amidst the many other little buzzes 
                                                                past the neon on & off 
                                                                     night & day     STEAK SANDWICH 
                                                             Have you ever tried one Anne?          SURE! 
                   “I wonder what time ‘its’?” 
                        as I sit on this new Doctor 
NO             I only look at buildings they’re in 
as you and he, I mean he & you & I buzz past 
                                                              in yellow ties      I call that gold 
                                         THE HOTEL BUCKINGHAM 
                        (facade) is black, and taller than last time 
is looming over lunch         naked        high time        poem       & I, equal in 
                                                                                   perfection & desire 
                 is looming         two eyes         over coffee-cup (white) nature 
                                             and man:         both hell on poetry. 
                                                   Art is art and life is 
                                                         “A monograph on infidelity” 
                                   Oh. Forgive me stench of sandwich 
                                    O pneumonia in American Poetry 

                  Do we have time?                           well look at Burroughs 
                          7 times been caught and brought back to Mars 
                                                       & eaten. 
“Art is art & Life 
is home,” Fairfield Porter said that 
                                                    turning himself in 
                                                                Tonight arrives again in red 
some go on            even in Colorado                                 on the run 
                                                                the forests shake 
                                  meaning: 
                                                   coffee            the cheerfulness of this poor
                                                                           fellow is terrible, hidden in 
                                                                          the fringes of the eyelids’ 
                                                   blue mysteries          (I’M THE SKY) 
                    The sky is bleeding now 
                                             onto 57th Street 
                                        of the 20th Century & 
                                                                HORN & HARDART’S 
                                          Right here. That’s PART 5 

                                                           I’m not some sailor off a ship at sea 
I’m the wanderer                                                                (age 4) 
                                                   & now everyone is dead 
                            sinking bewildered of hand, of foot, of lip 
     nude, thinking 
laughter burnished brighter than hate 
                                                                                                    Goodbye. 
                                    André Breton said that 
                                                                                  what a shit! 
Now he’s gone! 
                                    up bubbles all his amorous breath
                              & Monograph on Infidelity entitled
                                                                                          The Living Dream 
I never again played 
                                             I dreamt that December 27th, 1965 
                                   all in the blazon of sweet beauty’s breast

                    I mean           “a rose”           Do you understand that? 
                                                             Do you? 
The rock&roll songs of this earth 
commingling absolute joy AND 
incontrovertible joy of intelligence 
                                                                      certainly can warm 
                                                                   can’t they?        YES! 
                                                 and they do 
                           Keeping eternal whisperings around 

                                                                       (Mr. MacAdams writes in 
                                                                       the nude: no that’s not 
(we want to take the underground         me that: then zips in &
           revolution to Harvard!)                 out the boring taxis, re- 
                                                                      fusing to join the army 
                  and yet this girl has                asleep “on the springs” 
                         so much grace                   of red GENEROSITY) 
                                 I wonder! 
                      Were all their praises simply prophecies 
           of this 
                           the time!           NO GREATER THRILL 
                                                                      my friends 

           But I quickly forget them, those other times, for what are they 
   but parts in the silver lining of the tiny cloud my brain 
drifting up into smoke the city’s tough blue top: 

                                          I think a picture always 
                                         leads you gently to someone else 
Don’t you? like when you ask to leave the room 
                                         & go to the moon.

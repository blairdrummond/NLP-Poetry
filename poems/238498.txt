title : Frozen In

                             Venice, December
                        Ours are the only mouths
                        to taste with this smothering slow
                        touch, and the only steps
                        to sink like bellsounds and cave
                        deep into the marble snow.
 
                        Women who go to the window
                        to push their arms out to the snow
                        and then bring the shutters back in
                        follow us as we fall
                        past their eyes where the black night lives.
 
                        We are snowflakes at last, as the thick
                        never locked, never closed doors
                        follow us through squares of light
                        their windows have left on the snow.
                        Once again, warmth that falls,
                        again, though our tracks fill and slow.

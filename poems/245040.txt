title : At the New Year

In the shape of this night, in the still fall
         of snow, Father
 In all that is cold and tiny, these little birds
         and children
 In everything that moves tonight, the trolleys
         and the lovers, Father
 In the great hush of country, in the ugly noise
         of our cities
 In this deep throw of stars, in those trenches
         where the dead are, Father
 In all the wide land waiting, and in the liners
         out on the black water
 In all that has been said bravely, in all that is
         mean anywhere in the world, Father
 In all that is good and lovely, in every house
         where sham and hatred are
 In the name of those who wait, in the sound
         of angry voices, Father
 Before the bells ring, before this little point in time
         has rushed us on
 Before this clean moment has gone, before this night
         turns to face tomorrow, Father
 There is this high singing in the air
 Forever this sorrowful human face in eternity’s window
 And there are other bells that we would ring, Father
 Other bells that we would ring.

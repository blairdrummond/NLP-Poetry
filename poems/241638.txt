text : 
The poets are going home now,
 After the years of exile,
 After the northern climates
 Where they worked, lectured, remembered,
 Where they shivered at night
 In an indifferent world.
 Where God was the god of business,
 And men would violate the poets’ moon,
 And even the heavens become zones of war.
  
 The poets are going home
 To the blood-haunted villages,
 To the crumbling walls, still pocked
 With a spray of bullets;
 To the ravine, marked with a new cross,
 Where their brother died.
 No one knows the precise spot where they shot him,
 But there is a place now to gather, to lay wreaths.
 The poets will bring flowers.
  
 The poets are coming home
 To the cafés, to the life of the streets at twilight,
 To slip among the crowds and greet their friends;
 Thee young poets, old now, limping, who lean on a cane:
 Or the arm of a grandchild, peer with opaque eyes
 At the frightening city, the steel and concrete towers
 Sprung up in their absence.
 Yet from open doorways comes the odor of grapes
 Fermented, of fish, of oil, of pimiento…
  
 The poets have come home
 To the melodious language
 That settles in their heads like moths alighting,
 This language for which they starved
 In a world of gutturals,
 Crude monosyllables barked by strangers.
 Now their own language enfolds them
 With its warm vocables.
 The poets are home.
  
 Yes, they have come back
 To look up at the yellow moon,
 Cousin of that cold orb that only reflected
 Their isolation.
 They have returned to the olives, the light,
 The sage-scented meadows,
 The whitewashed steps, the tubs of geraniums,
 The sere plains, the riverbanks spread with laundry,
 The poppies, the vineyards, the bones of mountains.
  
 Yes, poets, welcome home
 To your small country
 Riven by its little war
 (As the world measures these events),
 A country that remembers heroes and tears;
 Where, in your absence, souls kept themselves alive
 By whispering your words.
 Now you smile at everything, even the priests, the militia,
 The patient earth that is waiting to receive you.

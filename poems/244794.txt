“what, to the american slave, is your 4th of july?”—frederick douglass
i.  august 1619
  
 arrived in a boat, named
 and unnamed, twenty, pirated
  
 away from a portuguese
 slaver, traded for victuals.
  
 drowned in this land of fresh,
 volatile clearings and folk
  
 with skin like melted
 cowrie shells. soon shedding
  
 servitude. soon reaping
 talents sown on african soil.
  
 after indenture, christians,
 colonists. not english, but
  
 not yet not-white. antoney
 and isabella, whose marriage
  
 stretched the short shadows
 of america’s early afternoon
  
 into the dusky reaches of evening,
 whose conjugal coitus spent
  
 first the choice coin of africa
 on rough virginian citizenship,
  
 baptized their son, william,
 into the church of england.
  
  
 ii.  december 1638
  
 fear must have shuddered
 into boston on the backs
  
 of true believers—men and
 women of an unadorned god—
  
 deep in the heavy black fabric
 of their coats and dresses like
  
 a stench. black a mark of
 pride they wore as if branded,
  
 never dreaming they could
 take it off. envy anticipated
  
 their advent. glittered at them,
 settling in, from the knife
  
 blades of the massachusetts.
 seeped like low-pitched
  
 humming from the fur
 lining the natives’ warm
  
 blankets. but desire docked
 in 1638. in from the harbor
  
 flocked a people whose eyes
 sparked like stars, even near
  
 death. whose hair promised
 a mixture of cotton and river
  
 water and vines, a texture
 the fingers ached for. who
  
 wholly inhabited a skin the
 midnight color of grace
  
 that clarified the hue of the
 pilgrims’ woolen weeds. fear
  
 and envy claimed pride of place,
 put desire’s cargo to good use.
  
  
 iii.  march 1770
  
 that night, crispus attucks
 dreamed. how he’d attacked
  
 his would-be master and fled
 in wild-eyed search of self-
  
 determination. discarded
 virginia on the run and ran
  
 out of breath in salt-scented
 boston. found there, if not
  
 freedom, fearlessness. a belief
 in himself that rocked things
  
 with the uncontrolled power
 of the muscular atlantic, power
  
 to cradle, to capsize. awoke
 angry again at the planter
  
 who’d taken him for a mule
 or a machine. had shouldered
  
 a chip the size of concord
 by the time the redcoat dared
  
 to dare him. died wishing he’d
 amassed such revolutionary
  
 ire in virginia. died dreaming
 great britain was the enemy.
  
  
 iv.  july 4th: last
       but not least
  
 17-, 18-, 19-76 and still
 this celebration’s shamed
  
 with gunpowder and words
 that lie like martyrs in cold
  
 blood. africa’s descendents,
 planting here year after year
  
 the seeds of labor, sweating
 bullets in this nation’s warts,
  
 have harvested the rope,
 the rape, the ghetto, the cell,
  
 the fire, the flood, and the
 blame for you-name-it. so
  
 today black folks barbeque
 ribs and smother the echoes
  
 of billie’s strange song in
 sauces. drink gin. gladly
  
 holiday to heckle speeches
 on tv. pretend to parade.
  
 turn out in droves for distant
 detonations, chaos, controlled
  
 as always, but directed
 away from us tonight. stare
  
 into the mirror of the sky
 at our growing reflection,
  
 boggled by how america
 gawks at the passing pinpoints
  
 of flame, but overlooks the vast,
 ebony palm giving them shape.

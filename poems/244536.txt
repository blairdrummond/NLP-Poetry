title : Artless

text : 
is my heart. A stranger
 berry there never was,
 tartless.
  
 Gone sour in the sun,
 in the sunroom or moonroof,
 roofless.
  
 No poetry. Plain. No
 fresh, special recipe
 to bless.
  
 All I’ve ever made
 with these hands
 and life, less
  
 substance, more rind.
 Mostly rim and trim,
 meatless
  
 but making much smoke
 in the old smokehouse,
 no less.
  
 Fatted from the day,
 overripe and even
 toxic at eve. Nonetheless,
  
 in the end, if you must
 know, if I must bend,
 waistless,
  
 to that excruciation.
 No marvel, no harvest
 left me speechless,
  
 yet I find myself
 somehow with heart,
 aloneless.
  
 With heart, 
 fighting fire with fire,
 fightless.
  
 That loud hub of us,
 meat stub of us, beating us
 senseless.
  
 Spectacular in its way,
 its way of not seeing,
 congealing dayless
  
 but in everydayness.
 In that hopeful haunting
 (a lesser
  
 way of saying
 in darkness) there is
 silencelessness
  
 for the pressing question.
 Heart, what art you?
 War, star, part? Or less:
  
 playing a part, staying apart
 from the one who loves, 
 loveless.

title : The Cardinal

author : Henry Carlile

text : 
Not to conform to any other color 
is the secret of being colorful. 

He shocks us when he flies 
like a red verb over the snow. 

He sifts through the blue evenings 
to his roost. 

He is turning purple. 
Soon he'll be black. 

In the bar's dark I think of him. 
There are no cardinals here. 

Only a woman in a red dress.

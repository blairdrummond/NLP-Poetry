title : Study in Orange and White

text : 
I knew that James Whistler was part of the Paris scene, 
but I was still surprised when I found the painting 
of his mother at the Musée d'Orsay 
among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes 
of the French Impressionists. 

And I was surprised to notice 
after a few minutes of benign staring, 
how that woman, stark in profile 
and fixed forever in her chair, 
began to resemble my own ancient mother 
who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth. 

You can understand why he titled the painting 
"Arrangement in Gray and Black" 
instead of what everyone naturally calls it, 
but afterward, as I walked along the river bank, 
I imagined how it might have broken 
the woman's heart to be demoted from mother 
to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness. 

As the summer couples leaned into each other 
along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats 
full of spectators slid up and down the Seine 
between the carved stone bridges 
and their watery reflections, 
I thought: how ridiculous, how off-base. 

It would be like Botticelli calling "The Birth of Venus" 
"Composition in Blue, Ochre, Green, and Pink," 
or the other way around 
like Rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color 
"Fishing Boats Leaving Falmouth Harbor at Dawn." 

Or, as I scanned the menu at the cafe 
where I now had come to rest, 
it would be like painting something laughable, 
like a chef turning on a spit 
over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks 
and calling it "Study in Orange and White." 

But by that time, a waiter had appeared 
with my glass of Pernod and a clear pitcher of water, 
and I sat there thinking of nothing 
but the women and men passing by— 
mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs— 
and about myself, 
a kind of composition in blue and khaki, 
and, now that I had poured 
some water into the glass, milky-green.

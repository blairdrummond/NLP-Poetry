title : An Old Story

author : Richard Hoffman

text : 
A few days after my mother died
 the furnace went out, and my father,
 who had been sitting in his chair
 across from hers since the funeral,
 
his unshaven chin on his chest,
 heaved himself up and went down
 the cold gray cellar stairs to see if
 he could relight the pilot himself
 
or would have to call for help.
 I know what it must have been like
 because I remember him other times
 on his back down there, cursing
 
match after match, god damning
 each for burning his fingers, as he
 reached through the tiny metal door
 as many times as it took. This time
 
it lit, caught, and roared back to life.
 When my father sat up he faced
 the washer, the dryer, the empty
 laundry basket, the ironing board,
 
and my mother’s radio above the sink,
 her absence so vivid that climbing
 the stairs he thought he heard her 
 behind him, and he turned around.

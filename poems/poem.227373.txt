No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace 
         As I have seen in one autumnal face. 
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape, 
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape. 
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame; 
         Affection here takes reverence's name. 
Were her first years the golden age? That's true, 
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new. 
That was her torrid and inflaming time, 
         This is her tolerable tropic clime. 
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence, 
         He in a fever wishes pestilence. 
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were, 
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where. 
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit 
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit; 
And here till hers, which must be his death, come, 
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb. 
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere 
         In progress, yet his standing house is here: 
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night, 
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight. 
In all her words, unto all hearers fit, 
         You may at revels, you at council, sit. 
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood; 
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood, 
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste 
         And appetite to other things is past. 
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree, 
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she, 
Or else because, being young, nature did bless 
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness. 
If we love things long sought, age is a thing 
         Which we are fifty years in compassing; 
If transitory things, which soon decay, 
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day. 
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack, 
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack; 
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade; 
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made; 
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone, 
         To vex their souls at resurrection: 
Name not these living death's-heads unto me, 
         For these, not ancient, but antique be. 
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay 
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day. 
Since such love's natural lation is, may still 
         My love descend, and journey down the hill, 
Not panting after growing beauties. So, 
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.

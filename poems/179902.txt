title : O Heart Uncovered

author : Joseph Ceravolo

text : 
We lived in province snow range 
and something that we uncover 
is like living 
in one Arizona room 
when we discover all we owe 
to darkness 
we never really know. 

Tomorrow is the national holiday for independenceâ€” 
no more left. 
For the first time 
we see the mountains 
with snow on them pulling away 
from the mountains and clouds.

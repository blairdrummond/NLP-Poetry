It Couldn't Be Done 
Edgar Albert Guest 
1881-1959


Living, Disappointment & Failure

Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

Somebody said that it couldn't be done 
      But he with a chuckle replied 
That "maybe it couldn't," but he would be one 
      Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried. 
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin 
      On his face. If he worried he hid it. 
He started to sing as he tackled the thing 
      That couldn't be done, and he did it! 

Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that; 
      At least no one ever has done it;" 
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat 
      And the first thing we knew he'd begun it. 
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin, 
      Without any doubting or quiddit, 
He started to sing as he tackled the thing 
      That couldn't be done, and he did it. 

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done, 
      There are thousands to prophesy failure, 
There are thousands to point out to you one by one, 
      The dangers that wait to assail you. 
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin, 
      Just take off your coat and go to it; 
Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing 
      That "cannot be done," and you'll do it.

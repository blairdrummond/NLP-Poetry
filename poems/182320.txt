title : Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey

Scrambled eggs and whiskey 
in the false-dawn light. Chicago, 
a sweet town, bleak, God knows, 
but sweet. Sometimes. And 
weren’t we fine tonight? 
When Hank set up that limping 
treble roll behind me 
my horn just growled and I 
thought my heart would burst. 
And Brad M. pressing with the 
soft stick, and Joe-Anne 
singing low. Here we are now 
in the White Tower, leaning 
on one another, too tired 
to go home. But don’t say a word, 
don’t tell a soul, they wouldn’t 
understand, they couldn’t, never 
in a million years, how fine, 
how magnificent we were 
in that old club tonight.

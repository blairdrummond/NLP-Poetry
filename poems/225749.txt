title : Never to Dream of Spiders

author : Audre Lorde

text : 
Time collapses between the lips of strangers   
my days collapse into a hollow tube 
soon implodes against now 
like an iron wall 
my eyes are blocked with rubble 
a smear of perspectives 
blurring each horizon 
in the breathless precision of silence 
one word is made. 

Once the renegade flesh was gone   
fall air lay against my face 
sharp and blue as a needle 
but the rain fell through October   
and death lay    a condemnation   
within my blood. 

The smell of your neck in August   
a fine gold wire bejeweling war   
all the rest lies 
illusive as a farmhouse 
on the other side of a valley 
vanishing in the afternoon. 

Day three    day four    day ten   
the seventh step 
a veiled door leading to my golden anniversary   
flameproofed free-paper shredded   
in the teeth of a pillaging dog   
never to dream of spiders   
and when they turned the hoses upon me 
a burst of light.

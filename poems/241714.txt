1. gone to lunch back in five minutes
  
 night closed in on my letter of resignation
 out in the square one of my threads had broken loose
 the language i used was no and no
 while the yellow still came through, the hammer and the drills
  
 occasionally the metabolism alters
 and lines no longer come express
 waiting for you what muscles work me
 which hold me down below my head?
  
 it is a long coat and a van on the horizon
 a bird that vanishes    the arabic
 i learn from observation is how to break the line
  
 (genius creates surprises : the metropolitan
 police band singing ‘bless this house’
  
 as the filmed extractor fans inflate the house with steam
  
  
 2. walking my back home
  
 the wind
 is the wind
 is a no-vo-cain band
  
 and the footstep
                           echoes
  
 i 
 have conjured people 
  
  
 3. ah, it all falls into place
  
 when it was time what he had left became a tile
 bodies held shaped by the pressure of air
 were clipped to his attention by their gestures
  
 my but we do have powerful muscles
 each of us equal to gravity

or sunlight that forces our shadows
 into the pieces of a fully interlocking puzzle
  
  
 4. good morning he whispered
  
 the horrors of the horses are the crows
 the bird flies past the outside the library
 many heels have trapped the same way
 he tolls, he lapsed with the light from so many trees
  
 check the pattern swerves with the back
 the tree that holds the metal spiral staircase swings
 aloft the hand removes a book and checked it
 for death by glasses or the angle food descends
  
  
 5. the broadcast
  
 she turns me on she turns on me
 that the view from the window is a lake
 and silent cars are given the noise of flies dying in the heat
 of the library    the grass outside goes brown
 in my head behind my glasses behind the glass in the precinct
 thus, too, they whisper in museums and banks

title : The Poet as Setting

author : Douglas Kearney

text : 
The jolt that comes to bones inside a tumbled streetcar

 is what the painter considers as she strokes her-
self into story. There is less to the jolt that
  
 comes as he shuts his eyes before the monitor, save

 what he imagines—a lightning bolt, a god tapping
the shoulder. He imagines the sky swelling
 
 with ceiling fans or the guano of extinct birds,
  
 a jolt riding from his shoulder
 blades to his eyelids, dropping with roller
  
 coaster clacks to his fingers. Here, he dreams of Frida

 Kahlo. Here, he says, let me spread my flesh out like a
 table linen, let my bones be silver that touches,
  
 making, again, that clack. My skull will be a glass,
  
 set properly, I have class enough. What jolt is
 it to chew over class, his body set before him as

 a reader sips (perhaps) a glass of something heady? We give
  
 books spines, we break them. The table will have
 its legs, its head. The body is upon us. Does the table have

 a stomach? Is it simply there to bear our hunger
 
without its own, like a eunuch bathing a stripper?
What is the poet without eyes or ears—reading, listening? He is
  
 a platform—a place to set, that to set it with. And if this is
 
all, what will he do when the reader finishes a glass,
rises from the poet’s head, and passes
 
into the city? Covered with a linen, he is waiting for
  
 something to spill, perhaps a girl in Mexico rolling 
her ankle in a street-
  
 car.

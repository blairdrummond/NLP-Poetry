Sonnet

While one sere leaf, that parting Autumn yields, 
   Trembles upon the thin, and naked spray, 
   November, dragging on this sunless day, 
   Lours, cold and sullen, on the watery fields; 
And Nature to the waste dominion yields, 
   Stripped her last robes, with gold and purple gay -- 
   So droops my life, of your soft beams despoiled, 
   Youth, Health, and Hope, that long exulting smiled; 
And the wild carols, and the bloomy hues 
   Of merry Spring-time, spruce on every plain 
   Her half-blown bushes, moist with sunny rain, 
More pensive thoughts in my sunk heart infuse 
   Than Winter's grey, and desolate domain 
   Faded like my lost Youth, that no bright Spring renews.

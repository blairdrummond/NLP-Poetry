title : His Carpets Flowered

I
 —how we’re carpet-making
 by the river
 a long dream to unroll
 and somehow time to pole
 a boat
  
 I designed a carpet today—
 dogtooth violets
 and spoke to a full hall
 now that the gall
 of our society’s
  
 corruption stains throughout
 Dear Janey I am tossed
 by many things
 If the change would bring
 better art
  
 but if it would not?
 O to be home to sail the flood
 I’m possessed
 and do possess
 Employer
  
 of labor, true—
 to get done
 the work of the hand… 
 I’d be a rich man
 had I yielded
  
 on a few points of principle
 Item sabots
 blouse—
 I work in the dye-house
 myself
  
 Good sport dyeing
 tapestry wool
 I like the indigo vats
 I’m drawing patterns so fast
 Last night
  
 in sleep I drew a sausage—
 somehow I had to eat it first
 Colorful shores—mouse ear...
 horse-mint... The Strawberry Thief
 our new chintz
  
  
 II
 Yeats saw the betterment of the workers
 by religion—slow in any case
 as the drying of the moon
 He was not understood—
 I rang the bell
  
 for him to sit down
 Yeats left the lecture circuit
 yet he could say: no one
 so well loved
 as Morris
  
  
 III
 Entered new waters
 Studied Icelandic
 At home last minute signs
 to post:
 Vetch
  
 grows here—Please do not mow
 We saw it—Iceland—the end
 of the world rising out of the sea—
 cliffs, caves like 13th century
 illuminations
  
 of hell-mouths
 Rain squalls through moonlight
 Cold wet
 is so damned wet
 Iceland’s
  
 black sand
 Stone buntings’
 fly-up-dispersion
 Sea-pink and campion a Persian
 carpet

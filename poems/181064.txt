title : To Mr. H. Lawes, On His Airs

author : John Milton

text : 
Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song 
      First taught our English music how to span 
      Words with just note and accent, not to scan 
      With Midas’ ears, committing short and long, 
Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng, 
      With praise enough for Envy to look wan; 
      To after-age thou shalt be writ the man 
      That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue. 
Thou honor’st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing 
      To honor thee, the priest of Phœbus’ choir, 
      That tun’st their happiest lines in hymn or story. 
Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher 
      Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing, 
      Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.

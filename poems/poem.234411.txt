Love, Desire, Infatuation & Crushes



Out of your whole life give but one moment!
All of your life that has gone before,
All to come after it, - so you ignore,
So you make perfect the present, - condense,
In a rapture of rage, for perfection's endowment,
Thought and feeling and soul and sense -
Merged in a moment which gives me at last
You around me for once, you beneath me, above me - 
Me - sure that despite of time future, time past, -
This tick of our life-time's one moment you love me!
How long such suspension may linger? Ah, Sweet -
The moment eternal - just that and no more - 
When ecstasy's utmost we clutch at the core
While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut and lips meet!

title : They Say It’s New

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
He crackles the air in big fist
 because it is turning, the night’s spine
 and the fast floor of last year is now the wall of this
  
 Those cracks should be flowers but there is no light
 nor lights in the windless binnacle strewn
 a slow rate of thought in the broad attention
  
 What is shorn to say and then to leave
 awake in the sleep, the pen without its cap
 the numbers that will harm if not arrayed
  
 The windows are not blank, the dark not empty
 but solid as the mask held loose before
 the eyeless active ridden hive
  
 The sounds of the mind entire are
 the wind below at the valley floor then a thumping above
 as of rocks at work painting the wall
  
 Turn out the lights and think invisibly
 stain the turn of time
 and hear the year before it’s there

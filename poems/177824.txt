title : A Historical Footnote to Consider Only When All Else Fails

author : Nikki Giovanni

text : 
(For Barbara Crosby)
While it is true 
(though only in a factual sense) 
That in the wake of a   
Her-I-can comes a   
Shower 
Surely I am not 
The gravitating force   
that keeps this house   
full of panthers 

Why, LBJ has made it   
quite clear to me   
He doesn’t give a 
Good goddamn what I think 
(else why would he continue to masterbate in public?) 

Rhythm and Blues is not 
The downfall of a great civilization 
And I expect you to 
Realize 
That the Temptations   
have no connection with   
The CIA 

We must move on to   
the true issues of   
Our time 
like the mini-skirt   
Rebellion 
And perhaps take a   
Closer look at 
Flour power 

It is for Us 
to lead our people   
out of the 
Wein-Bars 
   into the streets 
into the streets 
(for safety reasons only)   
Lord knows we don’t   
Want to lose the 
support 
of our Jewish friends 

So let us work 
for our day of Presence   
When Stokely is in 
The Black House 
And all will be right with   
Our World

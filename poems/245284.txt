title : Three Horse Operas

author : Robert Polito

text : 
                                                       for Patti Smith
At the end of Bing Crosby’s Riding High his horse
 Will be buried in the clay of the racetrack where he fell,
 As a lesson for all of us. Sad, waggish Bing,
 The Mob didn’t want Broadway Bill to win, so the jockey
 Pulled on the reins until the thoroughbred, straining
 Over the finish line first, collapsed, heart attack.
  
 I loved you like a guitar string breaking
 Under the conviction of a clumsy hand—
 Something like that . . . I suppose I must have
 Been thinking of you and your complex and beautiful band,
 Except the image demands I hold the guitar,
 If not you, and the broken string, as
  
 Over and over loudspeakers call riders to the starting gate.
 The track bartender and a teller, a sharpshooter and the chess master
 Wrestler, the petty con man and a cop, reprise their parts.
 The heist gang dons clown masks, and
 Sherry will betray George, and Johnny can’t love Fay,
 And the fortune in the suitcase just blows away.

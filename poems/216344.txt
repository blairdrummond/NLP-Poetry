To strip away this incessant chatter,
 yes, but what lies underneath it?

 Death, of course, or our fear of death.
 Which is why we talk so much,

 bury our heads in books, turn forests
 into pages and pages into mirrors

 in which we see ourselves appear
 and disappear. When I look up

 from the story I've been reading
 about the Jews in Nazi Germany

 and the silence that closed their
 mouths forever, I see a girl outside

 the cafe smiling in at her father
 who smiles back but cannot hear her.

 She makes all kinds of gestures
 with her hands, mimes herself

 inside an invisible box and breaks
 down laughing. Then she gathers

 her breath and blows it against
 the window. It is not snowing

 outside, the leaves have hardly begun
 to turn, the season is merely poised

 for the long descent, but still
 the glass steams up. And in this

 little cloud of warmth that's come
 from deep inside her body, she

 writes a single joyful word, which
 vanishes almost before she finishes.

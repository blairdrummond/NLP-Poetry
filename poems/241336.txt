text : 
Now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark
 City under the strict surveillance of quotation marks.
  
 The citizens with their cockades and free will drift off
 From the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.
  
 In the far suburbs crenellated of Cartesian yards and gin
 The tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in 
  
 Across the bluing evening. It’s the hour things get
 To be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet.
  
 Yikes. It’s fine to be here with you watching the great events
 Without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance
  
 Yet remain distant. Like the baker always about to understand
 Idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of Napoleon
  
 In a baker’s life, always interrupted by the familiar notes
 Of a childish song, “no more sleepy dreaming,” we float
  
 Casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom,
 Jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn.

title : “As We Are So Wonderfully Done with Each Other”

author : Kenneth Patchen

text : 
As we are so wonderfully done with each other   
We can walk into our separate sleep 
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies 

O my lady, my fairest dear, my sweetest, loveliest one 
Your lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers   
My hands are hallowed where they touched over your 
       soft curving. 

It is good to be weary from that brilliant work   
It is being God to feel your breathing under me 

A waterglass on the bureau fills with morning . . .   
Don’t let anyone in to wake us.

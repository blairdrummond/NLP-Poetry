The curve of her hip where I’d lay my head,
 that’s what I’m thinking of now, her fingers
 gone slow through my hair on a blue day
 ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere,
 where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand,
 cool as her kissing you with crushed ice,
 her tongue wet with blackberry and melon.
  
 That’s what I’m thinking of now.
 Because I’m all out of adrenaline,
 all out of smoking incendiaries.
  
 Somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain,
 under the skull’s blue curving dome—
 that’s where I am now, swaying
 in a hammock by the water’s edge
 as soldiers laugh and play volleyball
 just down the beach, while others tan
 and talk with the nurses who bring pills
 to help them sleep. And if this is crazy,
 then let this be my sanatorium,
 let the doctors walk among us here
 marking their charts as they will.
  
 I have a lover with hair that falls
 like autumn leaves on my skin.
 Water that rolls in smooth and cool
 as anesthesia. Birds that carry
 all my bullets into the barrel of the sun.

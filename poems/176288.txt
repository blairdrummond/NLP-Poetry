title : With Emma at the Ladies-Only Swimming Pond on Hampstead Heath

author : Linda Gregerson

text : 
In payment for those mornings at the mirror while,   
                        at her 
            expense, I’d started my late learning in Applied 

French Braids, for all 
                        the mornings afterward of Hush   
            and Just stand still, 

to make some small amends for every reg- 
                        iment- 
            ed bathtime and short-shrifted goodnight kiss, 

I did as I was told for once,   
                        gave up 
            my map, let Emma lead us through the woods 

“by instinct,” as the drunkard knew   
                        the natural 
            prince. We had no towels, we had 

no “bathing costumes,” as the children’s novels   
                        call them here, and I   
            am summer’s dullest hand at un- 

premeditated moves. But when 
                        the coppice of sheltering boxwood   
            disclosed its path and posted 

rules, our wonted bows to seemliness seemed   
                        poor excuse. 
            The ladies in their lumpy variety lay 

on their public half-acre of lawn,   
                        the water 
            lay in dappled shade, while Emma 

in her underwear and I   
                        in an ill- 
            fitting borrowed suit availed us of 

the breast stroke and a modified   
                        crawl. 
            She’s eight now. She will rather 

die than do this in a year or two   
                        and lobbies, 
            even as we swim, to be allowed to cut 

her hair. I do, dear girl, I will   
                        give up 
            this honey-colored metric of augmented 

thirds, but not (shall we climb   
                        on the raft 
            for a while?) not yet.

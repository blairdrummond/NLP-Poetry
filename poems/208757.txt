title : A Hanging Screen

“In warm sunlight jade   
engenders smoke”; poetry,   
like indigo mountain, 
keeps its distance; 

the light plays words   
and figures, stone’s   
edge edged with air,   
green haze growing. 

Amused by butterflies,   
Chuang Tsu dreaming,   
the emperor’s heart in 
spring, thoroughly transformed. 

Still, in pieces, the words   
rest so much apart.   
Risking my life I lean   
on dangerous railings. 


When the dream wakes   
to its own particulars,   
the strands scattered,   
loose hair on muslin, 

broken characters 
the reeds make, unmake— 
vague    no reason 
bright    again    dark— 

the sidewalk’s fracturing,   
damp willow twig 
forked there as well 
locust seedpods: 

Autumn, then, and 
gourd music, the wind— 
indistinct    no-stop 
break    again    join. 


Drifting between narrow   
bluffs, sharp bends 
enclose us, deep 
rain-cuts all around— 

mountain pass, slant   
sunlight and snow line,   
the dream piazza 
gilded into a high valley; 

“haze, mist,” Kuo Hsi   
interrupted, sluice- 
way wedged into 
a mountain like a keel; 

what was said by fire- 
light, the bandit in 
the yellow sombrero   
laughing at the window. 

Chill surprise of 
Chinese apples, glitter   
of the Pacific between   
buildings—caught in 

passing, an empty   
rowboat or Russian sealer   
riding at anchor, Magellan   
full sail in dusty curtains, 

casements groan like   
taut rigging, bright   
shore, the heat lines   
full of spice, breadfruit 

stretching to our hands;   
a new nourishment, this   
mission, or shaded rest— 
Pitcairn, a century or more. 


I wanted to make this poem   
of silk, stretched tight 
and polished, an ink wash   
drifting ambiguous mountains, 

words gathered like momentary   
details, instances of wind 
and water among loose foliage,   
painting au plein air; that is 

alive and painting a surface   
of perpetual change, the eye’s   
return always at odds with   
memory, however certain; 

the wind’s warp in the cloth,   
pressing the brushstroke back   
full of squalls, relaxing 
the line out of reach.

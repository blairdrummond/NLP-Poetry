515 Madison Avenue   
door to heaven? portal 
stopped realities and eternal licentiousness 
or at least the jungle of impossible eagerness 
your marble is bronze and your lianas elevator cables   
swinging from the myth of ascending 
I would join 
or declining the challenge of racial attractions 
they zing on (into the lynch, dear friends) 
while everywhere love is breathing draftily 
like a doorway linking 53rd with 54th 
the east-bound with the west-bound traffic by 8,000,000s   
o midtown tunnels and the tunnels, too, of Holland 

where is the summit where all aims are clear   
the pin-point light upon a fear of lust 
as agony’s needlework grows up around the unicorn   
and fences him for milk- and yoghurt-work 
when I see Gianni I know he’s thinking of John Ericson   
playing the Rachmaninoff 2nd or Elizabeth Taylor   
taking sleeping-pills and Jane thinks of Manderley   
and Irkutsk while I cough lightly in the smog of desire   
and my eyes water achingly imitating the true blue 

a sight of Manahatta in the towering needle 
multi-faceted insight of the fly in the stringless labyrinth   
Canada plans a higher place than the Empire State Building   
I am getting into a cab at 9th Street and 1st Avenue   
and the Negro driver tells me about a $120 apartment   
“where you can’t walk across the floor after 10 at night   
not even to pee, cause it keeps them awake downstairs” 
no, I don’t like that “well, I didn’t take it” 
perfect in the hot humid morning on my way to work   
a little supper-club conversation for the mill of the gods 

you were there always and you know all about these things   
as indifferent as an encyclopedia with your calm brown eyes   
it isn’t enough to smile when you run the gauntlet 
you’ve got to spit like Niagara Falls on everybody or 
Victoria Falls or at least the beautiful urban fountains of Madrid   
as the Niger joins the Gulf of Guinea near the Menemsha Bar 
that is what you learn in the early morning passing Madison Avenue   
where you’ve never spent any time and stores eat up light 

I have always wanted to be near it 
though the day is long (and I don’t mean Madison Avenue)   
lying in a hammock on St. Mark’s Place sorting my poems   
in the rancid nourishment of this mountainous island   
they are coming and we holy ones must go 
is Tibet historically a part of China? as I historically   
belong to the enormous bliss of American death

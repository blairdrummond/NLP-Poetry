title : To My Daughter in a Red Coat

author : Anne Stevenson

text : 
Late October. It is afternoon. 
My daughter and I walk through the leaf-strewn 
Corridors of the park 
In the light and the dark 
Of the elms' thin arches. 

Around us brown leaves fall and spread. 
Small winds stir the minor dead. 
Dust powders the air. 
Those shrivelled women stare. 
At us from their cold benches. 

Child, your mittens tug your sleeves. 
They lick your drumming feet, the leaves. 
You come so fast, so fast. 
You violate the past, 
My daughter, as your coat dances.

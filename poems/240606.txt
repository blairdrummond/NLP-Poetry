I
  
 The teacher said inner truth
 and the chalk said like a fresco inside the earth
 that no one has ever seen
 and one day decides to be discovered
 and begins to breathe—
 do you know what that means?
  
 II
  
 The child broke the chalk.
 The mother said be strong.
 The child said when I die I want to be a dwarf.
  
 III
  
 A detective has just drawn a circle
 with a piece of chalk, a private circle
 from which the victim will eventually look
 up, not at random, not at will,
 but when it calls to her,
 the chalk, the crushed bones
 of sea creatures who ringed the earth
 when it was under water.
  
 IV
  
 A man sits in the bath house
 in a deep tub
 of fizzling yellow water
 that surrounds every hair on his body
 and makes it stand upright.
 When the attendant comes, she will
 clean the tub by moving her hand
 slowly around the ring, like a snail.
  
 V
  
 An atoll is a ring of coral
 protecting a tureen of plankton.
 It is easy and Japanese to be sad
 knowing something is going to pass.
 He put the ring on her chalky finger.
  
 VI
  
 Long after chalk had passed out of use,
 carpenters still felt for it in their pockets
 and looked aimlessly at the sky.
  
 VII
  
 The cathedral was roofless.
 It began to snow inside.
 A half broken pillar in the nave
 grew taller.

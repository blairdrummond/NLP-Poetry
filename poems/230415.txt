text : 
Mother said to call her if the H-bomb exploded 
And I said I would, and it about did
When Louis my brother robbed a service station 
And lay cursing on the oily cement in handcuffs.

But by that time it was too late to tell Mother, 
She was too sick to worry the life out of her 
Over why why. Causation is sequence
And everything is one thing after another.

Besides, my other brother, Eddie, had got to be President, 
And you can't ask too much of one family.
The chances were as good for a good future
As bad for a bad one.

Therefore it was surprising that, as we kept the newspapers from Mother,
She died feeling responsible for a disaster unverified,
Murmuring, in her sleep as it seemed, the ancient slogan 
Noblesse oblige.

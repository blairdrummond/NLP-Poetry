title : This Ecstasy

author : Chard DeNiord

It’s not paradise I’m looking for
 but the naming I hardly gave a thought to.
 Call it the gift I carried in my loneliness
 among the animals before I started
 listening to the news. Call it the hint
 I had about the knowledge that would explode.
 In the meantime, which is real time
 plus the past, you’re swishing your skirt
 and speaking French, which is more
 than I can take, which I marvel at
 like a boy from the most distant seat 
 in the Kronos Dome, where I am one
 of so many now I see the point 
 of falling off. There’s not enough seats 
 for us all to attend the eschaton.
 This ecstasy that plants beauty
 on my tongue, so that if it were
 a wing, I’d be flying with the quickness
 of a hummingbird and grace of a heron,
 is so much mercy in light of the darkness 
 that comes. Who would say consolation?
 Who would say dross? Not that anyone
 would blame them. All night I hear
 so many echoes in the forest I’m tempted
 to look back, to save myself in hindsight,
 where all I see is the absence of me.
 Where all I hear is your voice,
 which couldn’t be more strange.
 How to go on walking hand in hand
 without our bodies on the path
 we made for our feet, talking, talking?

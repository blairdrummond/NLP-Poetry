title : After

author : Fady Joudah

text : 
Over treasure and land some texts will say it had
Little to do with slavery or the newly 
Discovered yellow planet

Few men watched the glaciers recede
From shuttles they had built
During the hemorrhage years
When they’d gathered all the genes down from the ledges

I’ll be a fig or a sycamore tree 
Or without hands

By then doctors and poets
Would have found a cure for prayer



•


Or have you shoved the door shut 
In the face of the dark?

Have you body and light the trap 
Of retribution doing unto you

What it does to others? You protest 
In the streets and papers and I leave

For a faraway land 
Where with pill and scalpel

And a distant reckoning 
If he should lick his lips

Or clench his fist I shall find his second left toe 
Infected puffy

From a bump
I’ll lance it and squeeze

Out the pus and offer 
Him an antibiotic

I can’t refuse therefore I am

The first time I saw you it was hot I was fed up
The second time your wife gave birth to a macerated boy

I had nothing to tell you 
About letting go of the dying 
In the morning you were gone

Had carried your father back to your house
His cracked skull
I didn’t know that was your wife
When I raised my voice

To those who were praying
From behind the wall to keep it down

I was trying to listen to your baby’s heartbeat 
With a gadget a century old



•


Anemic
From so much loss giving birth

If you give blood in the desert you won’t 
Get it back not your iron pills or magic hat 
I put your thin 
Hemoglobin up to the light and called out

To the donors Donors
If you want to know your blood type
And it’s a match
You must donate

Few came some indifferent to my condition 
Not having heard of it 
And willing anyhow



•


And the world is south
The night a bandit with gasoline

And I’m your dancing lizard mirth
I put my one arm up
And bring my one foot down on a hot zinc top
The nearest hospital was the dawn

She didn’t know her daughter on her back was 
The entry wound and she the exit

She ran a brothel so 
The officer said

Where the rebels came and went 
And ran into the government boys

Her girl’s femur the size of the bullet



•


He was from the other side rumors 
Had a bullet through his left arm 
Or had it bitten off by a camel

A camel elephant of the desert never forgets what you are 
If you aren’t kind to it

When I met him his bladder was the size 
Of a watermelon his prostate a cantaloupe 
You cannot catheterize 
A man forever

Every hour on the hour his left arm stump 
Hanging his good arm holding 
His penis his buttocks in deep squeeze 
A charge from the rear without spillage

This poor murderous thief desperately single-
Handedly began slapping his own ass 
As if he were dashing a stallion in a raid 
On some unarmed village



•


The mind in the field 
The brine in the field

Whether I
Is a diphthong codependent on

What isn’t there to stay in the field 
The good you act is equal

To the good you doubt 
Most have lost many

You are either prosperous 
Or veteran in the field



•


A mother offers not necessarily 
Sells her one-eyed son

For an education if you’ll bring him back 
And stone dust for one 
With congenital illness

And little boy with malaria 
Same old gas

Money mixed with blood
Transfusion the doctor’s perfect record broken

Nobility of taking 
A life you

Who must walk to and from your house
The jeep’s upkeep
The donkey-cart ambulance



•


One boot left behind

The one-boot photo I wanted
On a book military black the quad a clinic’s

Special Forces spun
By his dangling heels from

The pickup truck rushed
To a central town altered combative

With two scalp lacerations and blood 
In his auditory canal

I was a lover of loss I tossed
The boot in the capital of suffering

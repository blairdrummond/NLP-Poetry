title : Industrial Lace

text : 
The city had such pretty clotheslines. 
Women aired their intimate apparel

in the emery haze:
membranes of lingerie
pearl, ruby, copper slips
their somehow intestinal quivering in the wind.

And Freihofer’s spread the chaste, apron scent 
of baking, a sensual net 
over a few yards of North Troy.

The city had Niagara
Mohawk bearing down with power and light 
and members of the Local
shifting on the line.

They worked on fabrics made from wood and acid, 
synthetics that won’t vent.

They pieced the tropics into housecoats 
when big prints were the rage. 
Dacron gardens twisted on the line
over lots of Queen Anne’s lace.
Sackdresses dyed the sun
as sun passed through, making a brash stained glass 
against the leading of the tenements,

the warehouse holding medical supplies.
I waited for my bus by that window of trusses 
in Caucasian beige, trying to forget
the pathological inside.
I was thinking of being alive.

I was waiting to open
the amber envelopes of mail at home.
Just as food service workers, counter women, 
maybe my Aunt Fran, waited to undo 
their perms from the delicate insect meshes 
required by The Board of Health.

Aunt Alice wasn’t on this route.
She made brushes and plastics at Tek Hughes
milk crates of orange
industrial lace
the cartons could drip through.

Once we boarded, the girls from Behr-Manning 
put their veins up
and sawed their nails to dust
on files from the plant.
All day, they made abrasives. Garnet paper. 
Yes, and rags covered with crushed gems called 
garnet cloth.

It was duskwhen aunts and mothers formed 
their larval curls
and wrapped their heads in thick brown webs.

It was yesterdaytwenty years after 
my father’s death,
I found something he had kept. 
A packet of lightning-

cut sanding discs, still sealed.
I guess he meant to open the finish, 
strip the paint stalled on some grain 
and groom the primal gold.

The discs are the rough size
of those cookies the franchises call Homestyle 
and label Best Before.

The old cellophane was tough. 
But I ripped until I touched

their harsh done crust.

We lived in the lucky world— 
not the far place where flies 

sipped at eye corners 
of children too weak to cry. 

A camera showed that world to us 
on posters. But we were children. 

We wanted most to not be those 
others, with their terrible bones. 

We spoke of them wide-eyed, with 
what we thought was tenderness. 

But our words came in a different register,   
as if to speak of such betrayal   

by the grown world could bring   
a harm of great immensity 

upon us too. We got to choose 
from the cupboard. We gave 

what we hated—beets, peas, 
mushrooms. Our dreams 

were not of rice. The moon 
laid light on our bicycles propped 

against the porch. Sycamores 
became our giants standing guard; 

the overgrown shrub, our fort. We thought   
we understood what was required.   

Even crouched beneath our desks   
during drill, we said one prayer   

for the fear, one for recess.   
McClellan Air Force Base   

sent forth big-bellied planes   
that rattled the windows 

of our houses. Evenings, we took   
to the streets shrieking   

with joy, rode madly fast   
around the block. We collapsed   

on the lawn breathless, the earth 
cool beneath us & pounding hard,   

as if it had one great heart.   
As if it was ours.

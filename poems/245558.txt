 Man, if you’re dead, why are you leading
 me to drink after five sober years?
 Sonny, can I get a witness?
 I had a Snow White vision of the prodigal
 son returning to America
 that day of my final hangover.
 I tried to clear the mixture
 of cobwebs and shooting stars
 from my brain with spit-warm
 Budweiser, but the hair of the dog
 just was not doing the trick.
 I ended up pummeling myself
 seven times that day and named each egg
 white load for a Disney dwarf.
 The first was Dopey.
 The final was Sleepy, I think, or Droopy.

 Last year you scrawled a letter to me
 about your first and final visit
 to the Vietnam Memorial and how your eyes
 reflected off the shiny black stone
 and shot back into your brain like guidons
 unfurling the stench of cordite and the boy screams
 of men whose souls evaporated
 into morning mists over blue-green jungles.
 You had to be there, you said.
 That’s where you caught the cancer, you said.

 Sonny. Tonight I had a dream of Mom’s death
 twenty years too late and now my eyes
 will not close like I imagine the lid
 on her cheap casket did.
 I was not there when she died.
 Home on leave from Basic Training,
 you stood in for me
 because I was running scared
 through the drugged-out alleys of America,
 hiding from those Asian shadows
 that would finally ace you and now, now
 in the dark victory of your Agent Orange cancer,
 it gives me not one ounce of ease
 to say fuck Nixon and Kissinger,
 fuck all the generals and all
 the armies of God and fuck me,
 twenty years
 too late.

 History is history and thank God for that.
 When we were wise-ass American boys
 in our fifth grade geography class,
 we tittered over the prurient-sounding
 waves of Lake Titticaca … Titti … ca-ca
 and we never even had the slightest
 clue that Che was camping out
 en las montañas de Bolivia … 
 We never knew American chemists would
 kill you slicker than slant-eyed bullets.

 Damn Sonny. Five sober years done squeaked
 by like a silent fart and I’m on autopilot,
 sitting in a bar hoisting suds with ghosts,
 yours and my slowly evolving own.
 When we were seventeen with fake I.D.’s,
 we got into the Bucket of Blood
 in Virginia City and slurped sloe gin fizzes
 while the innocent jukebox blared
 “She’s Not There” by the Zombies.
 Later that drunken night you puked purple
 splotches onto my new, white Levis
 and a short, few years into your future
 this lost nation would award
 you two purple hearts,
 one of which your mother pressed
 into my hand that bright day
 we filed you under
 dry desert dirt.

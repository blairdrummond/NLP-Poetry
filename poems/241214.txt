title : Want

author : Joan Larkin

text : 
She wants a house full of cups and the ghosts
 of last century’s lesbians; I want a spotless
 apartment, a fast computer.  She wants a woodstove,
 three cords of ash, an axe; I want
 a clean gas flame.  She wants a row of jars:
 oats, coriander, thick green oil;
 I want nothing to store.  She wants pomanders,
 linens, baby quilts, scrapbooks.  She wants Wellesley
 reunions.  I want gleaming floorboards, the river’s
 reflection.  She wants shrimp and sweat and salt;
 she wants chocolate.  I want a raku bowl,
 steam rising from rice.  She wants goats,
 chickens, children.  Feeding and weeping.  I want
 wind from the river freshening cleared rooms.
 She wants birthdays, theaters, flags, peonies.
 I want words like lasers.  She wants a mother’s
 tenderness.  Touch ancient as the river.
 I want a woman’s wit swift as a fox.
 She’s in her city, meeting
 her deadline; I’m in my mill village out late
 with the dog, listening to the pinging wind bells, thinking
 of the twelve years of wanting, apart and together.
 We’ve kissed all weekend; we want
 to drive the hundred miles and try it again.

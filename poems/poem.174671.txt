When Britain first, at heaven's command, 
    Arose from out the azure main, 
This was the charter of the land, 
    And guardian angels sung this strain-- 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves." 

The nations, not so blest as thee, 
    Must in their turns to tyrants fall; 
While thou shalt flourish great and free, 
    The dread and envy of them all. 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves." 

Still more majestic shalt thou rise, 
    More dreadful from each foreign stroke; 
As the loud blast that tears the skies 
    Serves but to root thy native oak. 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves." 

Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame; 
    All their attempts to bend thee down, 
Will but arouse thy generous flame, 
    But work their woe and thy renown. 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves." 

To thee belongs the rural reign; 
    Thy cities shall with commerce shine; 
All thine shall be the subject main, 
    And every shore it circles thine. 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves." 

The Muses, still with freedom found, 
    Shall to thy happy coast repair: 
Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned, 
    And manly hearts to guard the fair. 
       "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves; 
       Britons never will be slaves."

title : Hesitation Theory

text : 
I drift into the sound of wind, 
how small my life must be 
to fit into his palm like that, holly 
leaf, bluejay feather, milkweed fluff, 
pin straw or sycamore pod, resembling 
scraps of light. The world 
slips through these fingers 
so easily, there’s so much 
to miss: the sociable bones 
linked up in supple rows, mineral 
seams just under the skin. I hold 
my palm against the sun and don’t see 
palm or sun, don’t hold anything 
in either hand. I look up, look 
away (what’s that?), I trip 
and stumble (fall 
again), find myself face down 
in duff, a foam of fallen live oak 
leaves, with only 
this life, mine at times.

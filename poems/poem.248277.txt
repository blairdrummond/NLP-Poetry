Elegy, Rhymed Stanza

 
He's gone, and all our plans
    Are useless indeed.
 We'll walk no more on Cotswold
    Where the sheep feed
    Quietly and take no heed.
  
 His body that was so quick
    Is not as you
 Knew it, on Severn river
    Under the blue
    Driving our small boat through.
  
 You would not know him now ...
    But still he died
 Nobly, so cover him over
    With violets of pride
    Purple from Severn side.
  
 Cover him, cover him soon!
    And with thick-set
 Masses of memoried flowers--
    Hide that red wet
    Thing I must somehow forget.

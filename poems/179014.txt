text : 
what more can man desire?
Always, he woke in those days   
With a sense of treasure, 
His heart a gayer glow 
Than his window grand with sun,   
As a child, its mind all whirring   
With green and hollied pleasure   
Wakes in a haze of Christmas! 
The season of secrets done. 

Or as one on country linen 
Wakes with a start one morning— 
Then on comfort snugger than pillows   
Floats: July at the lake. 
Or has married a golden girl 
And can hardly believe, but turning   
Sees blossom for him that very face   
Worshipping cameras take. 

Toy trains whirr perky on 
Till springs contort beneath;   
The middle-age rower slumps   
Like a sack—indignant seizure!   
Late editions wail 
Screen Star in Mystery Death— 
Yet in those same days 
He woke with a sense of treasure. 

Knowing: my love is safe 
Though the Rockies plunge like water,   
Though surf like a wildfire rage   
And omens roam the sky;   
Though limbs of the swimmer laze 
Pale where the seaweed caught her,   
Nothing can touch my love   
As dangerous time goes by.

title : Sleep Cycle

author : Dean Young

text : 
We cannot push ourselves away 
from this quiet, even in our sprees 
of inattention, the departing passengers   
stubbing out their smokes, arrivees in tears,   
lots of cellophane, the rumpus over parking. 

Wind scrapes leaves across the road,   
first flashes of snow, it is dark then 
it’s really dark. Forgive me for not 
writing for so long, I’ve been 
right beside you, one of the vaguer 
divinities blocking your way with its need   
to confess all its botched attempts at love,   
what started the whole mess. I love this place,   
its absurd use of balustrade, the chairs   
that dig into the spine, motorcyclists   
propping their drunk girlfriends in the sun,   
men playing timed chess with themselves,   
the guarantees and warnings that entice us   
to the brink of what they warn about. 

But we can do no more than pass through   
these rooms and their sudden chills   
where once a plea was entered almost   
unintentionally that seemed at last   
to reveal ourselves to ourselves, 
immaculate, bereft, deserving to be found.

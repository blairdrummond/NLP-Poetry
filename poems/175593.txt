title : A Little Language

author : Robert Duncan

text : 
I know a little language of my cat, though Dante says   
that animals have no need of speech and Nature   
abhors the superfluous.   My cat is fluent.   He   
converses when he wants with me.   To speak 

is natural.   And whales and wolves I’ve heard   
in choral soundings of the sea and air 
know harmony and have an eloquence that stirs   
my mind and heart—they touch the soul.   Here 

Dante’s religion that would set Man apart   
damns the effluence of our life from us   
to build therein its powerhouse. 

It’s in his animal communication Man is   
      true, immediate, and   
in immediacy, Man is all animal. 

His senses quicken in the thick of the symphony, 
      old circuits of animal rapture and alarm, 
attentions and arousals in which an identity rearrives. 
      He hears 
particular voices among 
      the concert, the slightest   
rustle in the undertones, 
      rehearsing a nervous aptitude   
yet to prove his. He sees the flick 
      of significant red within the rushing mass 
of ruddy wilderness and catches the glow 
      of a green shirt 
to delite him in a glowing field of green 
      —it speaks to him— 
and in the arc of the spectrum color   
      speaks to color. 
The rainbow articulates 
      a promise he remembers   
he but imitates 
      in noises that he makes, 

this speech in every sense   
the world surrounding him. 
He picks up on the fugitive tang of mace 
      amidst the savory mass, 
and taste in evolution is an everlasting key. 
      There is a pun of scents in what makes sense. 

      Myrrh it may have been, 
the odor of the announcement that filld the house. 

      He wakes from deepest sleep   

upon a distant signal and waits   

      as if crouching, springs 

      to life.

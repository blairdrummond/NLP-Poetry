					A little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice was eaten by someone with a sweet tooth the size of an elephant’s tusk.          Ah, he said, this darn tooth, it’s driving me nuts.           Then another voice is heard. It’s the little girl’s father who says, have you seen a little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice?--Incidentally, what’s that thing sticking out of your mouth like an elephant’s tusk?          My sweet tooth, and it’s really driving me nuts.          You ought to see a dentist.          But he might want to pull it, and I don’t like people pulling at me. If they want to pull they should pull at their own pullables.          So true, said the little girl’s father, people should pull at their own pullables and let other people's pullables alone. But still, he asked again, I wonder if you’ve seen a little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice?

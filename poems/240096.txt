title : November Becomes the Sky With Suppers for the Dead

author : Gordon Henry Jr.

text : 
I am standing outside 
in Minnesota
ghost wind recalling
names in winter mist

The road smells
of dogs two days dead

White photographers talk in 
the house of mainstream
media

I can’t articulate 
the agony of Eagle Singer’s
children to them.

We celebrate the old
man while another 
generation shoots 
crushed and heated
prescriptions
sells baskets,
machinery,
the fixtures yet to be
installed in the house,
yet to be heated
by the tribal government,
for another night
stolen by the stupors
and the wondrous
pleasure of forget
everything medicines.

Back inside 
Uncle Two Dogs rolls me
a smoke out of
organic American Spirit

I look to a last cup
of coffee.

The way home
fills with snow
our tracks
human and machine.

title : A Kind of Meadow

author : Carl Phillips

text : 
—shored 
by trees at its far ending, 
as is the way in moral tales: 

whether trees as trees actually,   
for their shadow and what   
inside of it 

hides, threatens, calls to; 
or as ever-wavering conscience,   
cloaked now, and called Chorus; 

or, between these, whatever 
falls upon the rippling and measurable,   
but none to measure it, thin 

fabric of this stands for. 
A kind of meadow, and then   
trees—many, assembled, a wood 

therefore. Through the wood   
the worn 
path, emblematic of Much 

Trespass: Halt. Who goes there?  
A kind of meadow, where it ends   
begin trees, from whose twinning 

of late light and the already underway   
darkness you were expecting perhaps   
the stag to step forward, to make 

of its twelve-pointed antlers 
the branching foreground to a backdrop   
all branches; 

or you wanted the usual 
bird to break cover at that angle   
at which wings catch entirely 

what light’s left, 
so that for once the bird isn’t miracle   
at all, but the simplicity of patience 

and a good hand assembling: first   
the thin bones, now in careful   
rows the feathers, like fretwork, 

now the brush, for the laying-on   
of sheen.... As is always the way, 
you tell yourself, in 

poems—Yes, always,   
until you have gone there,   
and gone there, “into the 

field,” vowing Only until   
there’s nothing more 
I want—thinking it, wrongly, 

a thing attainable, any real end 
to wanting, and that it is close, and that   
it is likely, how will you not 

this time catch hold of it: flashing,   
flesh at once 

lit and lightless, a way 
out, the one dappled way, back—

On the telephone, friends mistake us now   
when we first say hello—not after. 
And that oddly optimistic lilt 
we share nourishes my hopes: 
we do sound happy. . . . 

Last night, in my dream’s crib, 
a one-day infant girl. 
I wasn’t totally unprepared— 
there was the crib, and cotton kimonos,   
not just a padded dresser drawer. 

And then, I knew I could drive   
to the store for the tiny, funny   
clothes my daughter wears. 

I was in a familiar room 
and leaned over the rail, crooning   
Hello, and the smiling baby— 
she’d be too young for speech,   
I know, or smiles— 
gurgled back at me, Hullo. 

—If I could begin again,   
I’d hold her longer, closer! 
Maybe that way, when night opens   
into morning, and all my windows   
gape at the heartbreaking street,   
my dreams wouldn’t pierce so, 

I wouldn’t hold my breath 
at the parts of my life still in hiding,   
my childhood’s white house 
where I lunged toward the flowers of love   
as if I were courting death. . . . 

Over the crib, a mobile was spinning,   
bright birds going nowhere, 
primary colors, primary 
as mothering once seemed. . . . 

Later, I wonder why I dreamt 
that dream, yearning for what I’ve had,   
and have 

why it was my mother’s room, 
the blonde moderne bedroom set 
hidden under years of junk—a spare room’s   
the nicest way to put it, 

though now all 
her crowded rooms are spare—

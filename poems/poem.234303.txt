At the Wedding March 
Gerard Manley Hopkins 
1844-1889
Victorian
England
Love, Romantic Love



God with honour hang your head, 
Groom, and grace you, bride, your bed 
With lissome scions, sweet scions, 
Out of hallowed bodies bred. 

Each be other's comfort kind: 
Deep, deeper than divined, 
Divine charity, dear charity, 
Fast you ever, fast bind. 

Then let the March tread our ears: 
I to him turn with tears   
Who to wedlock, his wonder wedlock, 
Deals triumph and immortal years.

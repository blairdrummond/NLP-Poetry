title : Ode to Big Trend

Pretty soon the Negroes were looking to get paid. 
My partner, Big Trend, wiped his ox neck and said 

He wasn't going to wait too much longer. You 
Know that look your daddy gets before he whups you? 

That's how Big Trend looked. There was a pink scar 
Meddling his forehead. Most people assumed a bear 

Like him couldn't read anything but a dollar, 
But I'd watched him tour the used bookstore 
In town and seen him napping so I knew he held more 

Than power in those hands. They could tear 
A Bible in two. Sometimes on the walk home I'd hear 

Him reciting poems. But come Friday, he was the one 
The fellas asked to speak to the boss. He'd go alone, 

Usually, and left behind, we imagined the boss buckled 
Into Trend's shadow because our money always followed.

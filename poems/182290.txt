title : Tom O’ Bedlam among the Sunflowers

author : Thomas James

text : 
To have gold in your back yard and not know it. . . 
I woke this morning before your dream had shredded 
And found a curious thing: flowers made of gold, 

Six-sided—more than that—broken on flagstones, 
Petals the color of a wedding band. 
You are sleeping. The morning comes up gold. 

Perhaps I made those flowers in my head, 
For I have counted snowflakes in July 
Blowing across my eyes like bits of calcium, 

And I have stepped into your dream at night, 
A stranger there, my body steeped in moonlight. 
I watched you tremble, washed in all that silver. 

Love, the stars have fallen into the garden 
And turned to frost. They have opened like a hand. 
It is the color that breaks out of the bedsheets. 

This morning the garden is littered with dry petals 
As yellow as the page of an old book.   
I step among them. They are brittle as bone china.

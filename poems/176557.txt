title : Baby Ate a Microchip

author : Neal Levin

Baby ate a microchip, 
Then grabbed a bottle, took a sip. 
He swallowed it and made a beep, 
And now he’s thinking pretty deep. 

He’s downloading his ABCs 
And calculating 1-2-3s. 
He’s memorizing useless facts 
While doing Daddy’s income tax. 

He’s processing, and now he thrives 
On feeding his internal drives. 
He’s throwing fits, and now he fights 
With ruthless bits and toothless bytes. 

He must be feeling very smug. 
But hold on, Baby caught a bug. 
Attempting to reboot in haste,   
He accidentally got erased!

title : My name came from . . .

author : Emmett Tenorio Melendez

text : 
My name came from my great-great-great-grandfather.   
He was an Indian from the Choctaw tribe.   
His name was Dark Ant.   
When he went to get a job out in a city   
he changed it to Emmett.   
And his whole name was Emmett Perez Tenorio.   
And my name means:  Ant; Strong; Carry twice   
its size.

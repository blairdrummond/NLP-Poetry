title : Suzanna Socked Me Sunday

author : Jack Prelutsky

Suzanna socked me Sunday, 
she socked me Monday, too, 
she also socked me Tuesday, 
I was turning black and blue. 

She socked me double Wednesday, 
and Thursday even more, 
but when she socked me Friday, 
she began to get me sore. 

“Enough’s enough,” I yelled at her, 
“I hate it when you hit me!” 
“Well, then I won’t” Suzanna said— 
that Saturday, she bit me.

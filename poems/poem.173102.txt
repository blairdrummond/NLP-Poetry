Simile, Rhymed Stanza

   There be none of Beauty's daughters
       With a magic like thee;
And like music on the waters
       Is thy sweet voice to me:
When, as if its sound were causing
The charmed ocean's pausing,
The waves lie still and gleaming,
And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:

   And the midnight moon is weaving
       Her bright chain o'er the deep;
Whose breast is gently heaving,
       As an infant's asleep:
So the spirit bows before thee,
To listen and adore thee;
With a full but soft emotion,
Like the swell of Summer's ocean.

title : On What Planet

author : Kenneth Rexroth

text : 
Uniformly over the whole countryside
 The warm air flows imperceptibly seaward;
 The autumn haze drifts in deep bands
 Over the pale water;
 White egrets stand in the blue marshes;
 Tamalpais, Diablo, St. Helena
 Float in the air.
 Climbing on the cliffs of Hunter’s Hill
 We look out over fifty miles of sinuous
 Interpenetration of mountains and sea.
  
 Leading up a twisted chimney,
 Just as my eyes rise to the level
 Of a small cave, two white owls
 Fly out, silent, close to my face.
 They hover, confused in the sunlight,
 And disappear into the recesses of the cliff.
  
 All day I have been watching a new climber,
 A young girl with ash blonde hair
 And gentle confident eyes.
 She climbs slowly, precisely,
 With unwasted grace.
  
 While I am coiling the ropes,
 Watching the spectacular sunset,
 She turns to me and says, quietly,
 “It must be very beautiful, the sunset,
 On Saturn, with the rings and all the moons.”

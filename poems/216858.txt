title : Li Hua's Messenger

author : Peter Bethanis

text : 
In a hut far from the village   
Li Hua bends over his canvas   
like an insect.   

He is so deliberate,   
each stroke is a spider's legs   
fighting the current.   

There is a war in his veins,   
a battle of desires.   
He is jealous of Li Po   
whose pictures glide   
like the moon over dark water.   

I do not wish   
to disturb him   
as he tries to make art   
in this time of death,   

so I will wait,   
like a fly on the tip of a stick,   
until he is finished.

title : To an Ungentle Critic

author : Robert Graves

text : 
The great sun sinks behind the town
 Through a red mist of Volnay wine . . . .
 But what’s the use of setting down
 That glorious blaze behind the town?
 You’ll only skip the page, you’ll look
 For newer pictures in this book;
 You’ve read of sunsets rich as mine.
  
 A fresh wind fills the evening air
 With horrid crying of night birds . . . .
 But what reads new or curious there
 When cold winds fly across the air?
 You’ll only frown; you’ll turn the page,
 But find no glimpse of your ‘New Age
 Of Poetry’ in my worn-out words.
  
 Must winds that cut like blades of steel
 And sunsets swimming in Volnay,
 The holiest, cruellest pains I feel,
 Die stillborn, because old men squeal
 For something new: ‘Write something new:
 We’ve read this poem – that one too,
 And twelve more like ’em yesterday’?
  
 No, no! my chicken, I shall scrawl
 Just what I fancy as I strike it,
 Fairies and Fusiliers, and all.
 Old broken knock-kneed thought will crawl
 Across my verse in the classic way.
 And, sir, be careful what you say;
 There are old-fashioned folk still like it.

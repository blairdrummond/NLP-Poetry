title : Landscape with Scavengers and Bonelight

All day the ravens shit the buck whitetail 
back onto his antlers, the thick arcing tines 
graffitied with undigested tendons. Coyote- 
dragged, draped in a squawking garment 
that rises tattered when redtail-harried — 
revealing ribs, links of spine, tongue-clean 
sockets — and falls, in patches, back, stitched 
with wingsound. A feathered hush. Says you will 

go down in the dirt. First the four-leggeds 
ferrying your shape across the slough, yipping 
nothing resembling a name, large birds then like 

lamp-drawn moths, before the six-limbed elders 
arrive as one mind, as shifting soil, to polish 
what’s left, forsaking only the inedible brain.

title : Syrinx

author : Amy Clampitt

text : 
Like the foghorn that’s all lung, 
the wind chime that’s all percussion,   
like the wind itself, that’s merely air   
in a terrible fret, without so much   
as a finger to articulate 
what ails it, the aeolian 
syrinx, that reed 
in the throat of a bird, 
when it comes to the shaping of   
what we call consonants, is   
too imprecise for consensus   
about what it even seems to   
be saying: is it o-ka-lee 
or con-ka-ree, is it really jug jug, 
is it cuckoo for that matter?— 
much less whether a bird’s call   
means anything in 
particular, or at all. 

Syntax comes last, there can be   
no doubt of it: came last,   
can be thought of (is 
thought of by some) as a   
higher form of expression:   
is, in extremity, first to   
be jettisoned: as the diva   
onstage, all soaring 
pectoral breathwork, 
takes off, pure vowel 
breaking free of the dry,   
the merely fricative 
husk of the particular, rises   
past saving anything, any   
more than the wind in   
the trees, waves breaking,   
or Homer’s gibbering   
Thespesiae iachē: 

those last-chance vestiges   
above the threshold, the all- 
but dispossessed of breath.

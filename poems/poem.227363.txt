Rhymed Stanza, Simile

Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee, 
Before I knew thy face or name; 
So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame 
Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be; 
         Still when, to where thou wert, I came, 
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see. 
         But since my soul, whose child love is, 
Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do, 
         More subtle than the parent is 
Love must not be, but take a body too; 
         And therefore what thou wert, and who, 
                I bid Love ask, and now 
That it assume thy body, I allow, 
And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow. 

Whilst thus to ballast love I thought, 
And so more steadily to have gone, 
With wares which would sink admiration, 
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught; 
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon 
Is much too much, some fitter must be sought; 
         For, nor in nothing, nor in things 
Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere; 
         Then, as an angel, face, and wings 
Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear, 
         So thy love may be my love's sphere; 
                Just such disparity 
As is 'twixt air and angels' purity, 
'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.

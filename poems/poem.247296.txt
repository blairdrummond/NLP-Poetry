Fame is the one that does not stay -- (1507) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Living, Life Choices



Fame is the one that does not stay --
It's occupant must die
Or out of sight of estimate
Ascend incessantly --
Or be that most insolvent thing
A Lightning in the Germ --
Electrical the embryo
But we demand the Flame

title : Urban Renewal

text : 
The sun slides down behind brick dust,   
today’s angle of life. Everything 

melts, even when backbones   
are I-beams braced for impact. 

Sequential sledgehammers fall, stone   
shaped into dry air 

white soundsystem of loose metal   
under every footstep. Wrecking crews, 

men unable to catch sparrows without breaking   
wings into splinters. Blues-horn 

mercy. Bloodlines. Nothing   
but the white odor of absence. 

The big iron ball   
swings, keeping time 

to pigeons cooing in eaves   
as black feathers 

float on to blueprint   
parking lots.

This morning the world’s white face reminds us   
that life intends to become serious again. 
And the same loud birds that all summer long   
annoyed us with their high attitudes and chatter   
silently line the gibbet of the fence a little stunned,   
chastened enough. 

They look as if they’re waiting for things 
to grow worse, but are watching the house,   
as if somewhere in their dim memories 
they recall something about this abandoned garden   
that could save them. 

The neighbor’s dog has also learned to wake   
without exaggeration. And the neighbor himself   
has made it to his car with less noise, starting 
the small engine with a kind of reverence. At the window   
his wife witnesses this bleak tableau, blinking   
her eyes, silent. 

I fill the feeders to the top and cart them   
to the tree, hurrying back inside 
to leave the morning to these ridiculous   
birds, who, reminded, find the rough shelters,   
bow, and then feed.

title : Casanova's Bossa Nova

author : Rich Murphy

text : 
The dance shoes, seduction 
and coercion, owned by male feet, 
roam floors that beg for chandeliers. 
In search of flat-footed beauty 

and a bed, where ever they might be, 
the handsome conversation attracts 
female followers trading on the smiles 
of curves. The next steps are dizzying 

and leave dresses dipped and hung over 
with a purse and heart opened at 
their tops. The wallflowers can't say 
when the tango with the rag doll began, 

but witnesses toasted a conga line 
of would-be brides that transcend 
a retirement community in Florida, 
each giving up their precious moments 

on Earth to fandango's flimflam.

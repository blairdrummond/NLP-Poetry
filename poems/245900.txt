title : Language Lesson 1976

author : Heather McHugh

text : 
When Americans say a man
 takes liberties, they mean

 he’s gone too far. In Philadelphia today I saw
 a kid on a leash look mom-ward

 and announce his fondest wish: one
 bicentennial burger, hold

 the relish. Hold is forget,
 in American.

 On the courts of Philadelphia
 the rich prepare

 to serve, to fault. The language is a game as well,
 in which love can mean nothing,

 doubletalk mean lie. I’m saying
 doubletalk with me. I’m saying

 go so far the customs are untold.
 Make nothing without words,

 and let me be
 the one you never hold.

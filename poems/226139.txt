title : Reading the Bible Backwards

All around the altar, huge lianas 
curled, unfurled the dark green 
of their leaves to complement the red 
of blood spilled there—a kind of Christmas   
decoration, overhung with heavy vines 
and over them, the stars. 
When the angels came, messengers like birds   
but with the oiled flesh of men, they hung   
over the scene with smoldering swords,   
splashing the world when they beat 
their rain-soaked wings against the turning sky. 

The child was bright in his basket 
as a lemon, with a bitter smell from his wet   
swaddling clothes. His mother bent   
above him, singing a lullaby 
in the liquid tongue invented 
for the very young—short syllables   
like dripping from an eave 
mixed with the first big drops of rain   
that fell, like tiny silver pears, from 
the glistening fronds of palm. The three   
who gathered there—old kings uncrowned:   
the cockroach, condor, and the leopard, lords 
of the cracks below the ground, the mountain   
pass and the grass-grown plain—were not   
adorned, did not bear gifts, had not   
come to adore; they were simply drawn   
to gawk at this recurrent, awkward son   
whom the wind had said would spell   
the end of earth as it had been. 

Somewhere north of this familiar scene   
the polar caps were melting, the water was   
advancing in its slow, relentless 
lines, swallowing the old 
landmarks, swelling the 
seas that pulled 
the flowers and the great steel cities down.   
The dolphins sport in the rising sea,   
anemones wave their many arms like hair   
on a drowned gorgon’s head, her features   
softened by the sea beyond all recognition. 

On the desert’s edge where the oasis dies 
in a wash of sand, the sphinx seems to shift 
on her haunches of stone, and the rain, as it runs down,   
completes the ruin of her face. The Nile 
merges with the sea, the waters rise 
and drown the noise of earth. At the forest’s 
edge, where the child sleeps, the waters gather— 
as if a hand were reaching for the curtain 
to drop across the glowing, lit tableau. 

When the waves closed over, completing the green   
sweep of ocean, there was no time for mourning.   
No final trump, no thunder to announce 
the silent steal of waters; how soundlessly 
it all went under: the little family 
and the scene so easily mistaken 
for an adoration. Above, more clouds poured in   
and closed their ranks across the skies; 
the angels, who had seemed so solid, turned   
quicksilver in the rain. 
                                     Now, nothing but the wind   
moves on the rain-pocked face 
of the swollen waters, though far below 
where giant squid lie hidden in shy tangles,   
the whales, heavy-bodied as the angels,   
their fins like vestiges of wings, 
sing some mighty epic of their own— 

a great day when the ships would all withdraw,   
the harpoons fail of their aim, the land   
dissolve into the waters, and they would swim   
among the peaks of mountains, like eagles   
of the deep, while far below them, the old   
nightmares of earth would settle 
into silt among the broken cities, the empty   
basket of the child would float 
abandoned in the seaweed until the work of water   
unraveled it in filaments of straw, 
till even that straw rotted 
in the planetary thaw the whales prayed for,   
sending their jets of water skyward   
in the clear conviction they’d spill back   
to ocean with their will accomplished   
in the miracle of rain: And the earth   
was without form and void, and darkness   
was upon the face of the deep. And 
the Spirit moved upon the face of the waters.

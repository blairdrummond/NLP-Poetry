title : We Billion Cheered

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
We billion cheered. 
        Some threat sank in the news and disappeared.
It did because
        Currencies danced and we forgot what it was.

It rose again.
        It rose and slid towards our shore and when
It got to it,
        It laced like a telegram. We lit

Regular fires,
        But missed it oozing along irregular wires
Towards the Smoke.
        We missed it elbowing into the harmless joke

Or dreams of our
        Loves asleep in the cots where the dolls are.
We missed it how
        You missed an o’clock passing and miss now.

We missed it where
        You miss my writing of this and I miss you there.
We missed it through
        Our eyes, lenses, screen and angle of view.

We missed it though
        It specified where it was going to go,
And when it does,
        The missing ones are ten to one to be us.

We line the shore,
        Speak of the waving dead of a waving war.
And clap a man
        For an unveiled familiar new plan.

Don’t forget.
        Nothing will start that hasn’t started yet.
Don’t forget 
        It, its friend, its foe and its opposite.

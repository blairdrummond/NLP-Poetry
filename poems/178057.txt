title : Money

author : Philip Larkin

text : 
Quarterly, is it, money reproaches me: 
    ‘Why do you let me lie here wastefully? 
I am all you never had of goods and sex. 
    You could get them still by writing a few cheques.’ 

So I look at others, what they do with theirs:   
    They certainly don’t keep it upstairs. 
By now they’ve a second house and car and wife: 
    Clearly money has something to do with life 

—In fact, they’ve a lot in common, if you enquire: 
    You can’t put off being young until you retire, 
And however you bank your screw, the money you save 
    Won’t in the end buy you more than a shave. 

I listen to money singing. It’s like looking down 
    From long french windows at a provincial town,   
The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad 
    In the evening sun. It is intensely sad.

title : Malcolm X, February 1965

author : E. Ethelbert Miller

text : 
i will die this month. how
i do not know. still there
is much work to be done. i 
am afraid not for myself but
for betty and the girls. some
nights i stay awake looking
out the window, a gun in my
hand. i know how cruel people
can be. i have known hatred and
blindness. there are brothers
waiting to do me harm. i will
die for them. i will love them
as only i can. may allah be my
witness.

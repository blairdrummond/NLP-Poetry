title : The Goddess Who Created This Passing World

author : Alice Notley

text : 
The Goddess who created this passing world 
Said Let there be lightbulbs & liquefaction 
Life spilled out onto the street, colors whirled 
Cars & the variously shod feet were born 
And the past & future & I born too   
Light as airmail paper away she flew   
To Annapurna or Mt. McKinley   
Or both but instantly 
Clarified, composed, forever was I   
Meant by her to recognize a painting   
As beautiful or a movie stunning   
And to adore the finitude of words   
And understand as surfaces my dreams   
Know the eye the organ of affection   
And depths to be inflections   
Of her voice & wrist & smile

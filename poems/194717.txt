title : Sylvester’s Dying Bed

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
I woke up this mornin’   
’Bout half-past three.   
All the womens in town   
Was gathered round me. 

Sweet gals was a-moanin’,   
“Sylvester’s gonna die!” 
And a hundred pretty mamas   
Bowed their heads to cry. 

I woke up little later 
’Bout half-past fo’, 
The doctor ‘n’ undertaker’s   
Both at ma do’. 

Black gals was a-beggin’, 
“You can’t leave us here!”   
Brown-skins cryin’, “Daddy!   
Honey! Baby! Don’t go, dear!” 

But I felt ma time’s a-comin’,   
And I know’d I’s dyin’ fast. 
I seed the River Jerden 
A-creepin’ muddy past— 
But I’s still Sweet Papa ’Vester,   
Yes, sir! Long as life do last! 

So I hollers, “Com’ere, babies,   
Fo’ to love yo’ daddy right!” 
And I reaches up to hug ’em— 
When the Lawd put out the light. 

Then everything was darkness   
In a great ... big ... night.

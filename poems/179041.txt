title : Almost a Conjuror

author : Lucie Brock-Broido

text : 
The slight white poet would assume non-human forms, homely   
Grampus fish, a wahoo, nuthatch, nit. 

                                                      He had no romance except   
Remorse, which he used like fuzzy algebra. By pouring bluing 

On black porous coal, he crystallized, pronounced himself almost   
A sorcerer. He had an empty cloakroom 

                                                      In the chest of him. 
                                                      All the lost wool scarves 

Of all the world collected there & muffled him   
                                                      With wool. 

He imagined he could move a broom if he desired, just by wishing   
It. If he spoke of ghosts, he thought he could make of art vast 

                                                      Tattersall & spreading wings.   
When they found him in the nurse’s office, 

He was awkward as a charlatan, slightly queasy 
                                                      In an emperor’s real clothes. 

The thermos in his lunchbox was perpetually   
Broken and he lied. The small world smelled of oil 

Of peppermint, for a broken spell. Everything is plaid 
                                                      And sour in oblivion, as well.

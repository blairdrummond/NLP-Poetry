text : 
Shoulders knobbed against   
a slat-backed chair,   
the temples tugged, a pull 

at the nape, you felt the up- 
sweep as she smoothed the fine   
wisps back and tucked 

yank into yank 
and a third into that   
until the consecutive 

dodges of thumbs and first   
fingers gathered,   
fraying and filing 

to their end—ended 
in an ornament that, suspended,   
looked ridiculous, even 

on a child who mostly   
set forth with   
what was called 

a “finished” look, some   
loose ends in order where   
others were not 

and a slight weight below   
the nape’s pull. The view   
others had of it 

was invisible to you. 
It made something there   
where there would have been 

a blank—now instead   
a kind of face   
sent from woman to 

woman like a duty,   
an obstinate   
duty to pattern. 

It’s too simple to see   
one thing rather   
than another, a wish 

protruding once it’s been   
suppressed, a vise that holds   
a thought in its proper 

place until it bobs   
to the surface 
of a generally balmy 

sea. Women and   
woman only a letter   
away—a strand gets 

mixed, then mixed   
right out of the heaven   
of perfect fit; 

one kind of accident   
turns into another. 
The whole head throbs for days. 

Black and white are woven   
into gray the way   
hyperbole has no chance 

once it’s juxtaposed   
to reason—negation   
just a thread among 

the available options   
and hope itself apparent   
there in the very 

notion a made thing can last.   
Tougher, coarser, split   
weave in the years. Shorter, 

longer, shorter, the brain   
bound to its anchor.   
The brushed-out waves 

with their rick-rack   
shadows, a thread   
inside the case, 

the case inside 
the locket, the locket   
beneath the yoke. 

All the effort   
to save in itself   
a form of loss. 

You can tell a story 
many ways. You can leave   
something out or put 

something in; you can fool   
yourself and hide.   
You can shake out 

the form or try 
to manage every wisp,   
but the latter will 

only bring you pain.   
You went under 
the hand and eye of another 

and the tether cannot   
be undone.

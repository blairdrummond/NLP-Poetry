for Seamus Heaney
Overture:
                  violins:
it is all scraggy,
wideawake,
                  ironical,
decked out
                  in denim fatigues.
Witty and welcoming,
                  leathery-evergreen,
bemedalled with beercans,
cowpat and wallaby-dung,
flap,
    nub,
         hinge,
            node,
blindeye quartzite,
                  wafery sandstone,
bright as a button
subtle for mile on mile
far from vulgarity
                  (far from sleek Europe)
in its array of
                  furniture tonings
sheeted by sunglaze
                  lovingly dusted,
wispy and splintery,
tussocky,
                  corduroy,
all of its idiom
dry as a thesis
to moist outsiders:
wonderfully eloquent
                  on its home ground,
branchful of adverbs,
lovingly
                  wombat-hued,
dreamily
                  sheeptoned,
fluted with scalloping surf
and every step a joke.

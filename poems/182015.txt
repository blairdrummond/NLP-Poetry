title : Something Whispered in the Shakuhachi

No one knew the secret of my flutes, 
and I laugh now 
because some said I was enlightened. 
But the truth is 
I’m only a gardener 
who before the War 
was a dirt farmer and learned 
how to grow the bamboo 
in ditches next to the fields, 
how to leave things alone 
and let the silt build up 
until it was deep enough to stink 
bad as night soil, bad 
as the long, witch-grey 
hair of a ghost. 

No secret in that. 

My land was no good, rocky, 
and so dry I had to sneak 
water from the whites, 
hacksaw the locks off the chutes at night, 
and blame Mexicans, Filipinos, 
or else some wicked spirit 
of a migrant, murdered in his sleep 
by sheriffs and wanting revenge. 
Even though they never believed me, 
it didn’t matter—no witnesses, 
and my land was never thick with rice, 
only the bamboo 
growing lush as old melodies 
and whispering like brush strokes 
against the fine scroll of wind. 

I found some string in the shed 
or else took a few stalks 
and stripped off their skins, 
wove the fibers, the floss, 
into cords I could bind 
around the feet, ankles, and throats 
of only the best bamboos. 
I used an ice pick for an awl, 
a fish knife to carve finger holes, 
and a scythe to shape the mouthpiece. 

I had my flutes. 

                           * 

When the War came, 
I told myself I lost nothing. 

My land, which was barren, 
was not actually mine but leased 
(we could not own property) 
and the shacks didn’t matter. 

What did were the power lines nearby 
and that sabotage was suspected. 

What mattered to me 
were the flutes I burned 
in a small fire 
by the bath house. 

                           * 

All through Relocation, 
in the desert where they put us, 
at night when the stars talked 
and the sky came down 
and drummed against the mesas, 
I could hear my flutes 
wail like fists of wind 
whistling through the barracks. 
I came out of Camp, 
a blanket slung over my shoulder, 
found land next to this swamp, 
planted strawberries and beanplants, 
planted the dwarf pines and tended them, 
got rich enough to quit 
and leave things alone, 
let the ditches clog with silt again 
and the bamboo grow thick as history. 

                           * 

So, when it’s bad now, 
when I can’t remember what’s lost 
and all I have for the world to take 
means nothing, 
I go out back of the greenhouse 
at the far end of my land 
where the grasses go wild 
and the arroyos come up 
with cat’s-claw and giant dahlias, 
where the children of my neighbors 
consult with the wise heads 
of sunflowers, huge against the sky, 
where the rivers of weather 
and the charred ghosts of old melodies 
converge to flood my land 
and sustain the one thicket 
of memory that calls for me 
to come and sit 
among the tall canes 
and shape full-throated songs 
out of wind, out of bamboo, 
out of a voice 
that only whispers.

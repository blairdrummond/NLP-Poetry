title : Matisse, Too

author : Alicia Ostriker

text : 
Matisse, too, when the fingers ceased to work, 
Worked larger and bolder, his primary colors celebrating 
The weddings of innocence and glory, innocence and glory 

Monet when the cataracts blanketed his eyes 
Painted swirls of rage, and when his sight recovered 
Painted water lilies, Picasso claimed 

I do not seek, I find, and stuck to that story 
About himself, and made that story stick. 
Damn the fathers. We are talking about defiance.

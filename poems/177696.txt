title : Dear One Absent This Long While

It has been so wet stones glaze in moss; 
everything blooms coldly. 

I expect you. I thought one night it was you 
at the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs, 

you in a shiver of light, but each time 
leaves in wind revealed themselves, 

the retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak. 
We expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove. 

In May we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires 
over which young men and women leapt. 

June efforts quietly. 
Iâ€™ve planted vegetables along each garden wall 

so even if spring continues to disappoint 
we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain. 

I have new gloves and a new hoe. 
I practice eulogies. He was a hawk 

with white feathered legs. She had the quiet ribs 
of a salamander crossing the old pony post road. 

Yours is the name the leaves chatter 
at the edge of the unrabbited woods.

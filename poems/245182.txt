title : New Kind of Light

author : Zachary Schomburg

text : 
I move my hands
 in these woods
 to find her sex-parts.
  
 We discover our sex-parts
 make heat
 and blue light.
  
 We become outlines of ourselves—
  
 long scratches
 in the sky.
  
 We have a daughter
 who was never born.
  
 She lives in the house
 we never built,
  
 but in this new light,
 you can almost see
 its tattered roof.

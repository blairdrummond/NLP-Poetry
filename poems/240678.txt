title : Either

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
A northern hill aghast with weather
Scolds and lets me hurry over.
Someone phoned to tell my father
Someone died this morning of a 
Stroke. The news has tapped me with a
Stick. I vaguely knew his brother.
No one knows where I am either.

Now I’m lost. I don’t know whether
This road runs along the river
Far enough. I miss my lover,
Town and all the south. I’d rather
Die than be away forever,
What’s the difference. Here’s another
Field I don’t remember either.

title : Poet

author : Keith Waldrop

text : 
The wind dying, I find a city deserted, except for crowds of
 people moving and standing.
  
  
     Those standing resemble stories, like stones, coal from the
 death of plants, bricks in the shape of teeth.
  
  
     I begin now to write down all the places I have not been—
 starting with the most distant.
  
  
     I build houses that I will not inhabit.

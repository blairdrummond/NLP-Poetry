title : Convergence

Through the bedroom window 
a February sunrise, fog suspended 
between pines. Intricate crystals— 
hoarfrost lace on a cherry tree. 
My son calls out, awake. We sway, 
blanket-wrapped, his head nuzzling 
my neck. Hoarfrost, tree—I point, 
shaping each word. Favorable 
conditions: a toddler’s brain, hard 
data-mining, a system’s approach. 
Hoar, he hears. His hand reaches 
to the wallpaper lion. Phenomena 
converge: warmth, humidity, 
temperature’s sudden plunge;  
a child’s brain, objects, sound. 
Eyes widening, he opens his mouth 
and roars.

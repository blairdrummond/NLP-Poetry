1.
  
 Cogs & cogs that cannot turn
          to recognitions: such dogs in the dark noonday!
  
 As if the tongue told & tolled
 Among
          the melancholic arcades.
  
 Where the moods advance toward the modes.
  
 Time to try the knot, the Not
 Or to be caught
 Forever in nerve-traceries of Beauty . . .
  
 Unstrung, the structure is sound.
  
  
 2.
  
 Detour to far fires.
  
 To be counted missing . . . in a toroidal space
 That mimics the shape of its container, speech.
  
 The passive of, the possessive of—
  
 Measureless intent, blue almost black, the picture
          below the voice.
 Less a name than a substance
  
 Coming to stillness, star-inhabited.
 Less a substance than a sigh.
  
  
 3.
  
 Awaited, thou, unawaited. Divided here. O
          then
 Opened as earthen
          ring, cave-recorded.
  
 A mazed interior. Self-similar aisles of isles, pouring
          form from form.
  
 Lastness as device. Aligned as measurements (letters)—
  
          as sensitive, all-too-sensitive compass
          needles forever seeking
          the frozen pole, the zero.
  
 Caption: “An end-of-century sailing ship, Delirium
          held fast in sheets of ice.”

 No atmosphere is sufficient.
  
 An embryo in the brain is not yet breathing.
  
 There, the labor
 Of the living rock, where an ache, or bruise-ember
          will be discovered.
  
 Scored
          for Theremin, or permanently scarred.
  
 Where shadows point: Mad lengthening to made, as unmade
          scaffolding.
  
          Thus, repetition, resisted
          is the register of thought.
 Now here, even as staves are falling, another story
  
 —intervallic—cannot be told—that is, besieged
  
 As the heart encaged in bone.
  
 The animal calls long long, disconsolate
 In its hollow mountain.
  
  
 5. 
  
 Neither nor nor neither, time builds
 Its twelve tones between round & ruined.
  
 —as the roots of the sunflower, arrayed over earthlight.
  
 Routes unreturning / term without terminus. Riding as reading
 Migrates
          underground.
  
 Writing as the righting
 Of fallen
          angles, of tangles of Accident—
  
          arrives riven, a body never to be / surveyed.
  
 Abandoned in a wintry field, the sum of its travels
  
 —its hunting the same as its haunting.

title : All Summer Long

The dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch. 
A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree 
like a cry in the throat. The sky is clay for the child who is past 
being tired, who wanders in waist-deep 
grasses. Gnats rise in a vapor, 
in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears. 

The sun is an indistinct moon. Frail sticks 
of grass poke her ankles, 
and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs 
like wet fingers. The musk and smell 
of air are as hot as the savory 
terrible exhales from a tired horse. 

The parents are sleeping all afternoon, 
and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons. 
She hears their combined breathing and swallowing 
salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling 
like the sides of horses in the hot pasture. 

At evening a breeze dries and crumbles 
the sky and the clouds float like undershirts 
and cotton dresses on a clothesline. Horses 
rock to their feet and race or graze. 
Parents open their shutters and call 
the lonely, happy child home. 
The child who hates silences talks and talks 
of cicadas and the manes of horses.

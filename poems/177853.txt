title : Nikita

author : Alberto RÃ­os

text : 
Under a heavy wire milk case, 
A piece of concrete foundation
On top, in summer, in her backyard, 
Mrs. Russo keeps the cat Nikita safe 
From birds, from dogs, from eating 
Johnson grass, which he throws up. 
Nikita waits for ants to wander in 
And for the sun to leave.
Instead, she comes to keep him 
Company, saying You look fat 
And that her son died,
Remember I told you?
Walking thin in his uniform
On a road.

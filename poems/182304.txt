text : 
go on sister sing your song 
lady redbone señora rubia 
took all day long 
shampooing her nubia 

she gets to the getting place 
without or with him 
must I holler when   
you’re giving me rhythm 

members don’t get weary   
add some practice to your theory 
she wants to know is it a men thing 
or a him thing 

wishing him luck   
she gave him lemons to suck 
told him please dear 
improve your embouchure

title : & then afterward

 (i) 
  
 I woke to early sun:
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
 We kept reaching
 through the long night.
  
  
 (ii)
  
 Afterward,
  
 the small deceptions
 we allow ourselves:
 a sickness, unchecked.
 Like this:
  
  
 (iii)
  
 & first sunlight.
 Snow continues.
 I could never close my eyes to light.
  
 But there was no light
 & you looked like night. 
  
  
 (iv)
  
 There must be a pattern,
  
 snow slow-dropping in wet clusters
 through the wooden arms
 of empty trees.
  
  
 (v)
  
 Sun fingering its way
 through branches
  
 I’d hung my life on.
 We don’t matter a bit; realization
 forces our eyes closed—
  
  
 (vi)
  
 A sickness, unchecked, like this.
 I’d hung my life on
  
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
  
 (vii)
  
 Our arms together
 we searched for patterns
  
 & sunlight.
  
  
 (viii)
  
 Our arms laced together,
 pointing together
 over wind-tossed grasses.
  
 Us: waist deep in night blue.
  
  
 (ix)
  
 There was no light.
 You pointed.
  
  
 (x)
  
 Sun overhead,
 you pointed
 to the wind-tossed grasses.
 This is a memory now. 
  
  
 (xi)
  
 Together in that first sun,
 so vivid:
 there must be a pattern
  
 I’d hung my life on.
  
  
 (xii)
  
 Snow dropped in clusters,
 staggered & jagged.
  
 We don’t matter a bit.
  
  
 (xiii)
  
 Reflected in lake water:
 all these things I’ll forget.
  
  
 (xiv)
  
 Our arms together
  
 but we keep reaching
 over the wind-tossed grasses.
  
  
 (xv)
  
 Black smoke curling:
  
 the importance 
 of night-blue field grass,
  
  
 (xvi)
  
 the importance of.
  
 The stars are close; we try to hold together.
  
  
 (xvii)
  
 All this ends
 but until then:
  
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
 The stars are close; we try to hold.
 Such distance between the fallen!
  
  
 (xviii)
  
 Burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
 You pointed.
  
  
 (xix)
  
 Grasses silently fold,
 a sickness, unchecked, reaching. Like this.
  
 Wooden arms of trees
 long since emptied.
  
  
 (xx)
  
 This ends in darkness,
 & all the stars within reach,
 & other constellations.

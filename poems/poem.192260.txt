Poems for Weddings



My eyes catch ruddy necks
Sturdily pressed back.
All a red-brick moving glint.
Like flaming pendulums, hands
Swing across the khaki--
Mustard coloured khaki--
To the automatic feet. 

    We husband the ancient glory
In these bared necks and hands.
Not broke is the forge of Mars;
But a subtler brain beats iron
To shoe the hoofs of death.
Who pays dynamic air now?--
Blind fingers loose an iron cloud
To rain immortal darkness
On strong eyes.

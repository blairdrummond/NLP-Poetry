title : O-Jazz-O War Memoir: Jazz, Don’t Listen To It At Your Own Risk

In the beginning, in the wet
 Warm dark place,
 Straining to break out, clawing at strange cables
 Hearing her screams, laughing
 “Later we forgave ourselves, we didn’t know”
 Some secret jazz
 Shouted, wait, don’t go.
 Impatient, we came running, innocent
 Laughing blobs of blood & faith.
 To this mother, father world
 Where laughter seems out of place
 So we learned to cry, pleased
 They pronounce human.
 The secret Jazz blew a sigh
 Some familiar sound shouted wait
 Some are evil, some will hate.
 “Just Jazz, blowing its top again”
 So we rushed & laughed.
 As we pushed & grabbed
 While jazz blew in the night
 Suddenly they were too busy to hear a simple sound
 They were busy shoving mud in men’s mouths,
 Who were busy dying on the living ground
 Busy earning medals, for killing children on deserted street corners
 Occupying their fathers, raping their mothers, busy humans we
 Busy burning Japanese in atomicolorcinemascope
 With stereophonic screams,
 What one hundred per cent red blooded savage, would waste precious 
             time
 Listening to jazz, with so many important things going on
 But even the fittest murderers must rest
 So they sat down in our blood soaked garments,
 and listened to jazz
             lost, steeped in all our death dreams
 They were shocked at the sound of life, long gone from our own
 They were indignant at the whistling, thinking, singing, beating,
             swinging,
 They wept for it, hugged, kissed it, loved it, joined it, we drank it,
 Smoked it, ate with it, slept with it
 They made our girls wear it for lovemaking
 Instead of silly lace gowns,
 Now in those terrible moments, when the dark memories come
 The secret moments to which we admit no one
 When guiltily we crawl back in time, reaching away from ourselves
 They hear a familiar sound,
 Jazz, scratching, digging, blueing, swinging jazz,
 And listen,
 And feel, & die.

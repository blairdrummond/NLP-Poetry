title : Apology for Apostasy?

author : Etheridge Knight

text : 
Soft songs, like birds, die in poison air 
So my song cannot now be candy. 
Anger rots the oak and elm; roses are rare, 
Seldom seen through blind despair. 

And my murmur cannot be heard 
Above the din and damn. The night is full 
Of buggers and bastards; no moon or stars 
Light the sky. And my candy is deferred 

Till peacetime, when my voice shall be light, 
Like down, lilting in the air; then shall I 
Sing of beaches, white in the magic sun, 
And of moons and maidens at midnight.

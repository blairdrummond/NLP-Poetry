title : my poem

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
a love person
 from love people
 out of the afrikan sun
 under the sign of cancer.
 whoever see my 
 midnight smile
 seeing star apple and
 mango from home.
 whoever take me for
 a negative thing,
 his death be on him
 like a skin
 and his skin
 be his heart’s revenge.

 lucy one-eye
 she got her mama’s ways.
 big round roller
 can’t cook 
 can’t clean
 if that’s what you want
 you got it world.
  
 lucy one-eye
 she see the world sideways.
 word foolish
 she say what she don’t want
 to say, she don’t say
 what she want to.
  
 lucy one-eye
 she won’t walk away
 from it.
 she’ll keep on trying
 with her crooked look
 and her wrinkled ways,
 the darling girl.

 if mama 
 could see
 she would see
 lucy sprawling
 limbs of lucy
 decorating the
 backs of chairs
 lucy hair
 holding the mirrors up
 that reflect odd
 aspects of lucy.
  
 if mama
 could hear
 she would hear
 lucysong rolled in the
 corners like lint
 exotic webs of lucysighs
 long lucy spiders explaining
 to obscure gods.
  
 if mama 
 could talk
 she would talk
 good girl
 good girl
 good girl
 clean up your room.

i was born in a hotel,
 a maskmaker.
 my bones were knit by
 a perilous knife.
 my skin turned around
 at midnight and
i entered the earth in
 a woman jar.
 i learned the world all
 wormside up
 and this is my yes
 my strong fingers;
 i was born in a bed of
 good lessons
 and it has made me 
wise.

 light
 on my mother’s tongue
 breaks through her soft
 extravagant hip
 into life.
 lucille
 she calls the light,
 which was the name
 of the grandmother
 who waited by the crossroads
 in virginia
 and shot the whiteman off his horse,
 killing the killer of sons.
 light breaks from her life
 to her lives…
  
 mine already is 
 an afrikan name.

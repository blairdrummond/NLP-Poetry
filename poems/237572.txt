We brown boys
           play
                      stick games,
           say
                      nicknames
 like BIG D, EVIL E;
 and conjure Knievel
 with jigsawed dirt bikes
 and sewer curbs
 for asphalt launch pads.
           We all sweat
           to know flight
           for just
           a minute.

 We brown boys,
           hair
                      all knaps,  
           wear
                      ballcaps’
 broken brims. Broken rims
 from hungry slamdunks,
 pro-ball pipe dreams
 over ice cream man’s
 “Pop Goes the Weasel.”
           We all hunt
           change from cords’,
           Bermudas
           and mamas.

 We brown boys—
           smack
                     talking
           slap
                     boxing—
 stay bragging and bagging,
 drinking summer from hoses
 and water bomb barrages.
 We throw rocks at garages
 making no dents.
          We all just
           trying to leave
           a mark.

title : On Seeing the Wind at Hope Mansell

author : Geoffrey Hill

text : 
Whether or not shadows are of the substance 
such is the expectation I can 
wait to surprise my vision as a wind 
enters the valley: sudden and silent 
in its arrival, drawing to full cry 
the whorled invisibilities, glassen towers 
freighted with sky-chaff; that, as barnstorming 
powers, rammack the small 
orchard; that well-steaded oaks 
ride stolidly, that rake the light-leafed ash, 
that glowing yew trees, cumbrous, heave aside. 
Amidst and abroad tumultuous lumina, 
regents, reagents, cloud-fÃªted, sun-ordained, 
fly tally over hedgerows, across fields.

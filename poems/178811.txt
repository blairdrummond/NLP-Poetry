The week in August you come home, 
adult, professional, aloof, 
we roast and carve the fatted calf 
—in our case home-grown pig, the chine 
garlicked and crisped, the applesauce 
hand-pressed. Hand-pressed the greengage wine. 

Nothing is cost-effective here. 
The peas, the beets, the lettuces 
hand sown, are raised to stand apart. 
The electric fence ticks like the slow heart 
of something we fed and bedded for a year, 
then killed with kindness’s one bullet 
and paid Jake Mott to do the butchering. 

In winter we lure the birds with suet, 
thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat. 
Darlings, it’s all a circle from the ring 
of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn 
to the gouged pine table that we lounge around, 
distressed before any of you was born. 

Benign and dozy from our gluttonies, 
the candles down to stubs, defenses down, 
love leaking out unguarded the way 
juice dribbles from the fence when grounded 
by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe, 
how eloquent, how beautiful you seem! 

Wearing our gestures, how wise you grow, 
ballooning to overfill our space, 
the almost-parents of your parents now. 
So briefly having you back to measure us 
is harder than having let you go.

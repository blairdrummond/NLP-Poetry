title : Astrophil and Stella 107

author : Sir Philip Sidney

text : 
Stella, since thou so right a princess art 
Of all the powers which life bestows on me, 
There ere by them aught undertaken be 
They first resort unto that sovereign part; 
Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart, 
Which pants as though it still should leap to thee, 
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy 
To this great cause, which needs both use and art, 
And as a queen, who from her presence sends 
Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit, 
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends. 
On servants’ shame oft master’s blame doth sit. 
Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove, 
And scorning say, “See what it is to love.”

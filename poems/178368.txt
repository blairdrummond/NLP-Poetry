title : Large Intestine

Look in the mirror. Let us both look. 
Here is my naked body. 
Apparently you like it, 
I have no reason to. 
Who bound us, me and my body? 
Why must I die 
together with it? 
I have the right to know where the borderline   
between us is drawn. 
Where am I, I, I myself. 

Belly, am I in the belly? In the intestines?   
In the hollow of the sex? In a toe? 
Apparently in the brain. I do not see it. 
Take my brain out of my skull. I have the right   
to see myself. Don’t laugh. 
That’s macabre, you say. 

It’s not me who made 
my body. 
I wear the used rags of my family,   
an alien brain, fruit of chance, hair   
after my grandmother, the nose 
glued together from a few dead noses.   
What do I have in common with all that?   
What do I have in common with you, who like   
my knee, what is my knee to me? 

Surely 
I would have chosen a different model. 

I will leave both of you here, 
my knee and you. 
Don’t make a wry face, I will leave you all my body   
to play with. 
And I will go. 
There is no place for me here, 
in this blind darkness waiting for 
corruption. 
I will run out, I will race 
away from myself. 
I will look for myself   
running 
like crazy 
till my last breath. 

One must hurry 
before death comes. For by then   
like a dog jerked by its chain 
I will have to return 
into this stridently suffering body.   
To go through the last 
most strident ceremony of the body. 

Defeated by the body, 
slowly annihilated because of the body 

I will become kidney failure 
or the gangrene of the large intestine.   
And I will expire in shame. 

And the universe will expire with me,   
reduced as it is 
to a kidney failure 
and the gangrene of the large intestine.

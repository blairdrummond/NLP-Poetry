title : [From Mars cruel god of war]

author : Franco Buffoni

text : 
From Mars cruel god of war 
The desire to tie the corpse to the chariot 
And drag it around each morning, 
From Mercury the idea to put a stop to that 
And buy the body back. 
Because everything sooner or later becomes a musical 
Or a collectible card or figurine 
Hitler or the Fierce Saladin 
Dracula the Impaler 
All stripped of any awareness of suffering: 
There is no voice in stones 
No word that turns to flesh or blood. 
(At that auction held at Bolaffi, 
Those intriguing heart-shaped or "C" postmarks 
Stamped after their arrival in Florence 
On two letters sent from the field to the family 
Of a student volunteer at Curtatone.)

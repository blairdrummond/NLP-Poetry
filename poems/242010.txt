title : The Beak of the Pelican

author : J. Patrick Lewis

text : 
She looks for wiggly fishes,
At least so it appears,
To stuff inside the suitcase
That's swinging from her ears. 

And though she's very graceful
When flying round and round,
How does she get that faceful
Of luggage off the ground?

title : The Wheel

author : Vinda Karandikar

text : 
Someone is about to come but doesn't. Is about 
to turn on the stairs but doesn't. 
I button my shirt 
come from the laundry with all its dazzling blots, 
like one's peculiar fate. 
I shut the door, sit quietly. 
The fan begins to whirl 
and turn the air into a whirlpool of fire, 
making a noise bigger than the house. 
Someone is about to come and doesn't. 
It doesn't matter. 
Calmly I lean against the wall, 
become a wall. 
A wounded bird on my shoulder laughs raucously, 
laughs at the shoulder it perches on! 

My soul of flesh and blood puts a long thread in the needle's eye. 
I stitch a patch on my son's umbrella. 
I pick his nose and name the pickings: 
I call one "Elephant" and another "Lion." 
Someone is about to come and doesn't. Is about 
to turn on the stairs and doesn't. 
I tickle my children, 
they tickle me in turn; I laugh, 
with a will; for I do not feel tickled. 
It doesn't matter. 
I scan their fingers for signs: 
Nine conches and one wheel. 



Note: "Nine conches and one wheel" are formations of lines on the tips of fingers which, in Indian palmistry, foretell a happy life.

I keep placing my hands over 
my face, the fingertips just 
resting on the place where I feel 
my eyebrows and the fine end 
of a bone. My eyes are covered 
with the blood of my hands, my 
palms hold 
my jaws. I do this at dinner. 
My daughter asks 
Are you all right? 
and by a common miracle 
when I smile 
she knows I am. 

             2 

I ask her what she will do 
after we eat. Sleep she 
tells me. But I will clean 
the deer skull, wash it. 

             3 

You gave me this skull in the woods 
told me to bring it clean 
and tell the story I had told you 
before, about how the deer had 
come to me, and I said I would. 

             4 

And I put this skull on an old 
newspaper, pulled the lower part 
of the jaws free, touched it first 
carefully, as if it would fall apart 
in my hands, the bone paper- 
thin, and then I saw I could 
scrub, so brushed the surface with 
steel and my fingers and more 
and more this surface became 
familiar to me. 

             5 

I wanted to see the lines of it 
what it would be if it had been 
polished by the wind, the water, 
and my hands, these agents making 
the skull more itself. 
Slowly I was not afraid at all 
and my fingers went into the deepest 
holes of this thing, not afraid 
for myself or it, feeling 
suddenly as if cleaning this 
small fragment of earth away 
from the crevices inside was 
like loving. 

            6 

But it was when I touched the place 
where the eyes were that I knew 
this was the shell of the deer that had 
lived here, this was this deer 
and not this deer, her home and 
now empty of her, but not 
empty of her, I knew also, not 
empty of her, as my hands 
trembled. 

            7 

And in that instant remembered you 
had been in that body of 
that deer dying, what 
does it feel like to be a deer 
dying, the death consumes 
you like birth, you are 
nowhere else but in the center. 

            8 

Remembering those gentle deer 
that watched me as I wept, 
or the deer that leapt as if 
out of my mind, when I saw 
speaking there in that green place 
the authority of the heart 
and the deer of the woods where 
my feet stood, stared at me until 
I whispered to her and cried 
at her presence. 

            9 

And when I cleaned the skull 
I washed myself and sat 
my body half out of the water 
and put my hands again over 
my face, my fingers edging the 
bone over my eyes, and I thought 
how good this feels and this 
is a gesture you make. 

            10 

Tell this story of the deer’s skull 
you asked quietly and so I 
came in my own time to put 
these words carefully here 
slowly listing each motion 
on this thin paper 
as fragile and as tough 
as knowledge.

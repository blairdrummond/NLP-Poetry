title : Emergency Haying

author : Hayden Carruth

text : 
Coming home with the last load I ride standing 
on the wagon tongue, behind the tractor 
in hot exhaust, lank with sweat, 

my arms strung 
awkwardly along the hayrack, cruciform. 
Almost 500 bales we’ve put up 

this afternoon, Marshall and I. 
And of course I think of another who hung 
like this on another cross. My hands are torn 

by baling twine, not nails, and my side is pierced 
by my ulcer, not a lance. The acid in my throat 
is only hayseed. Yet exhaustion and the way 

my body hangs from twisted shoulders, suspended 
on two points of pain in the rising 
monoxide, recall that greater suffering. 

Well, I change grip and the image 
fades. It’s been an unlucky summer. Heavy rains 
brought on the grass tremendously, a monster crop, 

but wet, always wet. Haying was long delayed. 
Now is our last chance to bring in 
the winter’s feed, and Marshall needs help. 

We mow, rake, bale, and draw the bales 
to the barn, these late, half-green, 
improperly cured bales; some weigh 150 pounds 

or more, yet must be lugged by the twine 
across the field, tossed on the load, and then 
at the barn unloaded on the conveyor 

and distributed in the loft. I help— 
I, the desk-servant, word-worker— 
and hold up my end pretty well too; but God, 

the close of day, how I fall down then. My hands 
are sore, they flinch when I light my pipe. 
I think of those who have done slave labor, 

less able and less well prepared than I. 
Rose Marie in the rye fields of Saxony, 
her father in the camps of Moldavia 

and the Crimea, all clerks and housekeepers 
herded to the gaunt fields of torture. Hands 
too bloodied cannot bear 

even the touch of air, even 
the touch of love. I have a friend 
whose grandmother cut cane with a machete 

and cut and cut, until one day 
she snicked her hand off and took it 
and threw it grandly at the sky. Now 

in September our New England mountains 
under a clear sky for which we’re thankful at last 
begin to glow, maples, beeches, birches 

in their first color. I look 
beyond our famous hayfields to our famous hills, 
to the notch where the sunset is beginning, 

then in the other direction, eastward, 
where a full new-risen moon like a pale 
medallion hangs in a lavender cloud 

beyond the barn. My eyes 
sting with sweat and loveliness. And who 
is the Christ now, who 

if not I? It must be so. My strength 
is legion. And I stand up high 
on the wagon tongue in my whole bones to say 

woe to you, watch out 
you sons of bitches who would drive men and women 
to the fields where they can only die.

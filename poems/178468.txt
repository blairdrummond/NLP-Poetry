The women were divided between regrets for the homes they had left and fear of the deserts and savages before them.  —Francis Parkman
nothing but this continent   
intent on its dismay— 
hands, etc. bandaged,   
a torn petticoat fringed   
with lace, roseate frozen   
fingers, or elsewhere   
feet wrapped in burlap   
scuffing new snow 

after the indigo of their tunics   
seeps back into the soil 
this spring, the several springs’   
dulling thaw and incidental greenery 

what marks they made were   
harrowed out by those who settled,   
so set themselves against the land 

whether to keep the land   
open to passage 
or parcel it to the plow   
Benton and Everett argued 

“English tartars,” some said, 
white savages to plunder the trade,   
“only farmer and tradesman stabilize” 

his head raised slightly   
the dying woodsman   
views the open plains, 

“flat water” squalls 
spilling stiff grasses 
into the small shade a stand   
of scrub trees gives his end 

“huge skulls and whitening   
bones of buffalo   
were scattered everywhere” 

the Conestoga’s canvas   
straining to the wind,   
the plow’s first bite,   
the first indenture   
of the rutted road,   
crossties set down,   
oil, asphalt glittering   
quartz aggregate to the sun 

the harrow’s bright discs   
crumble the damp shine   
of the new furrow, 
the wind dulls and sifts   
grassland into dust 

two days in the storm cellar,   
wet rags to their faces, 
the slatted door impacted   
with wet rags, dowery linens 

strange light at the cyclone’s   
onset, a cupped brightness   
edging banks of dark clouds,   
fields darkening in lines   
of gathering dust, section   
on section spilling eastward, 

a straw drilled through a tree,   
a team of mules transported   
forty miles intact 

a dream of transport, Dorothy   
soaring on the wind, becalmed   
in still another summer, lost,   
follows billboards and Burma Shave   
into the city’s ragged sprawl 

Uptown or Lakeview, five 
children in three rooms, A.D.C.,   
weathers like unpainted wood,   
stacked porches where her laundry 
tatters with city grit, bars   
haunted by banjo music 

everybody talks of home 
as though it were the sparkle   
of an earlier dream, a glint 
of rainwater in someone’s hair,   
names you can’t remember,   
old photographs gone brown   
with age, a man and woman,   
faces obscured by broad hats,   
a bare tree beside them, 
the bare distances empty   
and faded into the sky 

Oxus, Phasis, Palmyra— 
Oz encased in glass, 
“variegated with fields and meadows”   
store window dioramas 
display the life and manners 
of high-rise glass apartments— 
The El Dorado, Malibu East— 
warm winters, cool summers   
high above the city’s noise 

clouds move in facets   
across their polished faces,   
tipped red at sunset, presiding 
over a close-set clutter   
of flat, graveled roofs 

graceful as mannequins   
they are laughing into 
the summer evening, women   
bright as spring flowers,   
in autumn’s colors, 
warmed and smiling,   
they talk of love 
before a dying fire 

gray as she is, aging,   
she fingers the pictures   
of ladies’ magazines,   
fingers, as well, pictures   
she brought from home 

the red flowers on the floor   
wear into black treads, black   
dust comes in at her windows 

his weapons arranged at his side,   
the sun darkening his sight,   
Cooper contrived his death   
in alien spaces; Boone finished   
his days on a crumbling porch   
that fronted on the open West

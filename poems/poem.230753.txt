Free Verse

A porcupine skin, 
Stiff with bad tanning, 
It must have ended somewhere. 
Stuffed horned owl 
Pompous 
Yellow eyed; 
Chuck-wills-widow on a biassed twig 
Sooted with dust. 
Piles of old magazines, 
Drawers of boy's letters 
And the line of love 
They must have ended somewhere. 
Yesterday's Tribune is gone 
Along with youth 
And the canoe that went to pieces on the beach 
The year of the big storm 
When the hotel burned down 
At Seney, Michigan.

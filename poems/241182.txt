title : dear love,

author : Barbara Jane Reyes

text : 
you dream in the language of dodging bullets and artillery fire.
 new, sexy diagnoses have been added to the lexicon on your behalf
 (“charlie don’t surf,” has also been added to the lexicon on your behalf).

in this home that is not our home, we have mutually exiled each
 other. i walk down your street in the rain, and i do not call you. i
 walk in the opposite direction of where i know to find you. that we
 do not speak is louder than bombs.
  
 there are times that missing you is a matter of procedure. now is
 not one of those times. there are times when missing you hurts. so
 it comes to this, vying for geography. there is a prayer stuck in my
 throat. douse me in gasoline, my love, and strike a match. let’s see
 this prayer ignite to high heaven.

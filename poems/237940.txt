title :  Take Me Out to the Go-Go

author : Thomas Sayers Ellis

text : 
Nikita zips across stage
Trailed by a troop of white-gloved
One-wheelers: Killer Joes, 
The 12 & Under Crew
In disguise. 

A sixth sense guides him
Beyond darkness. An 
Inner voice says when,
Don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop,
I’ll tell you when. 

A constellation of funeral homes. 
Jumpsuits. Red & white
Ribbons in the sky. The total 
Groove, a carnival of roses
Circling the moon. 

Mere call & response
Never knocked socks this way,
Lifting nicknames & dates
From the faces of tombstones
And mere call & response never will. 

God climbs inside, 
Asking for souls—
Something we weren’t taught to share.

title : For Allen Ginsberg

Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright,   
Taunter of the ultra right,   
What blink of the Buddha’s eye   
Chose the day for you to die? 

Queer pied piper, howling wild, 
Mantra-minded flower child,   
Queen of Maytime, misrule’s lord   
Bawling, Drop out! All aboard! 

Finger-cymbaled, chanting Om, 
Foe of fascist, bane of bomb, 
Proper poets’ thorn-in-side, 
Turner of a whole time’s tide, 

Who can fill your sloppy shoes? 
What a catch for Death. We lose 
Glee and sweetness, freaky light, 
Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright.

title : Minor Poet

author : Bill Sweeney

text : 
His last composed poem, "Over My Head," 
    closes with the evening tide 
coming in as the light fails over Brighton Beach. 

In the years of The Great Plague, 
    he lived with his mother and brother 
and wrote the Elegies that remain unpublished, 

under the eaves in an unfinished room above 
    his mother's late-night television vigil. 
He wrote to a ghostly laugh-track 

in the night. Though he cut out and saved 
    lurid, five-color magazine pictures 
of The South Pacific, The Aegean; though 

he hoped for a winter crossing by steamer 
    until his final weakness set in, 
underneath he was a city boy 

whose poems drifted like a dinghy 
    in small inlets—Gravesend, Rockaway— 
out too far for safety, in sight of land.

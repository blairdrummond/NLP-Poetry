title : Veil

author : Todd Davis

text : 
In this low place between mountains 
 fog settles with the dark of evening. 
 Every year it takes some of those 
 we love—a car full of teenagers
 on the way home from a dance, or 
 a father on his way to the paper mill, 
 nightshift the only opening. 
 Each morning, up on the ridge, 
 the sun lifts this veil, sees what night 
 has accomplished. The water on our window- 
 screens disappears slowly, gradually, 
 like grief. The heat of the day carries water 
 from the river back up into the sky, 
 and where the fog is heaviest and stays 
 longest, you’ll see the lines it leaves 
 on trees, the flowers that grow 
 the fullest.

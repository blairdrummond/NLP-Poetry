for John
I couldn’t see in this light 
even if I wished. The black 
grillwork over black, cool upon coal, 
kisses me back in an icy press. 
Not wanting—anything—but to fall 
as the empty trash cans mingle 
below with the smell of feral cats. 

Flailing moon the color of suds 
over this factory of artifice, 
moored in the poverty of my untouched 
element, downed like a dog 
struck by a diesel—one headlamp 
flaring before my shadow’s dust 
buries its past in a crescent of mirth. 

Lost now in this anonymity of barely 
knowing you, my body would go 
unsearched for in the rubble. Who could 
remember my odor, my perfect strangeness 
at a glance? Life leaves through the gate 
of an ache, where you are, a vanishing 
landscape. Do I dare it back? 

I don’t know where you go 
anymore when you escape 
into that vast wilderness 
of our legal separation. Your 
memory rises from the knocking 
pipes, a sudden heat, a blast 
of blood. Where does it go? 

The galloping horses I hear are not 
hooves but my heart kicking in its swollen 
stall. But you, you take things as 
a letting go, like a beacon that opens 
a lens cap to our past. You take off 
the dark like this snow-strewn alley, 
a radiance, but no light of mine. 

Jealous as an abandoned child, I 
had no word for father. It floated 
in heaven like friend or famine. 
It rose like a muscle and punctuated 
my dreams, the ones of ruined houses, 
of countries like this one where the faces 
of whores and the working poor are my own. 

You had Irish eyes the color of old 
ice. What you lost was first love 
and a word for forever, like evergreen, 
oceanic, fossil. My bones could grind 
themselves to salt and I would still be 
this aging woman, this battered lifeline. 
History never has been kind to a loser. 

What do I see when morning 
chops ice into jade? What ring 
could I trade now for the freedom 
to bleed? What would I remember 
of a hearth where the flags 
of my silks beat at half mast, where 
I studied a sure vocabulary of snow? 

I had to leave before I could 
hear it: the sound of dishwater 
in a steamed house, the singing 
of water on white porcelain, cooling 
like clots seeping through a wound, 
our collision of tensions, a viscous 
rendered fat, divorced, releasing.

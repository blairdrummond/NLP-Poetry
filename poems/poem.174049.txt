Rhymed Stanza

The time I've lost in wooing, 
In watching and pursuing 
The light, that lies 
In woman's eyes, 
Has been my heart's undoing. 
Though Wisdom oft has sought me, 
I scorn'd the lore she brought me, 
My only books 
Were woman's looks, 
And folly's all they've taught me. 

Her smile when Beauty granted, 
I hung with gaze enchanted, 
Like him the Sprite, 
Whom maids by night 
Oft meet in glen that's haunted. 
Like him, too, Beauty won me, 
But while her eyes were on me, 
If once their ray 
Was turn'd away, 
Oh! winds could not outrun me. 

And are those follies going? 
And is my proud heart growing 
Too cold or wise 
For brilliant eyes 
Again to set it glowing? 
No, vain, alas! th' endeavour 
From bonds so sweet to sever; 
Poor Wisdom's chance 
Against a glance 
Is now as weak as ever.

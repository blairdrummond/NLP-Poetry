title : The Men

As a kid sitting in a yellow vinyl   
booth in the back of Earl’s Tavern,   
you watch the late-afternoon drunks   
coming and going, sunlight breaking   
through the smoky dark as the door   
opens and closes, and it’s the future   
flashing ahead like the taillights   
of a semi as you drop over a rise   
in the road on your way to Amarillo,   
bright lights and blonde-haired women,   
as Billy used to say, slumped over   
his beer like a snail, make a real man   
out of you, the smile bleak as the gaps   
between his teeth, stay loose, son,   
don’t die before you’re dead. Always 
the warnings from men you worked with   
before they broke, blue fingernails,   
eyes red as fate. A different life 
for me, you think, and outside later,   
feeling young and strong enough to raise 
the sun back up, you stare down Highway 54,   
pushing everything—stars, sky, moon,   
all but a thin line at the edge 
of the world—behind you. Your headlights   
sweep across the tavern window,   
ripping the dark from the small, humped   
shapes of men inside who turn and look,   
like small animals caught in the glare   
of your lights on the road to Amarillo.

Refrain

Enter JANUS 
JANUS 
Chronos, Chronos, mend thy pace, 
An hundred times the rolling sun 
Around the radiant belt has run 
In his revolving race. 
Behold, behold, the goal in sight, 
Spread thy fans, and wing thy flight. 

Enter CHRONOS, with a scythe in his hand, and a great globe on his back, which he sets down at his entrance 
CHRONOS 
Weary, weary of my weight, 
Let me, let me drop my freight, 
And leave the world behind. 
I could not bear 
Another year 
The load of human-kind. 

Enter MOMUS Laughing 
MOMUS 
Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! well hast thou done, 
         To lay down thy pack, 
         And lighten thy back. 
The world was a fool, e'er since it begun, 
And since neither Janus, nor Chronos, nor I, 
         Can hinder the crimes, 
         Or mend the bad times, 
'Tis better to laugh than to cry. 

CHORUS OF ALL THREE 
 'Tis better to laugh than to cry 

JANUS 
Since Momus comes to laugh below, 
         Old Time begin the show, 
That he may see, in every scene, 
What changes in this age have been, 

CHRONOS 
Then Goddess of the silver bow begin. 

Horns, or hunting-music within 
DIANA 
With horns and with hounds I waken the day, 
And hie to my woodland walks away; 
I tuck up my robe, and am buskin'd soon, 
And tie to my forehead a waxing moon. 
I course the fleet stag, unkennel the fox, 
And chase the wild goats o'er summits of rocks, 
With shouting and hooting we pierce thro' the sky; 
And Echo turns hunter, and doubles the cry. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
 With shouting and hooting, we pierce through the sky, 
 And Echo turns hunter, and doubles the cry. 

JANUS 
Then our age was in its prime, 

CHRONOS 
Free from rage, 

DIANA 
--And free from crime. 

MOMUS 
A very merry, dancing, drinking, 
Laughing, quaffing, and unthinking time. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
Then our age was in its prime, 
Free from rage, and free from crime, 
A very merry, dancing, drinking, 
Laughing, quaffing, and unthinking time. 

Dance of Diana's attendants 
MARS 
Inspire the vocal brass, inspire; 
The world is past its infant age: 
         Arms and honour, 
         Arms and honour, 
Set the martial mind on fire, 
And kindle manly rage. 
 Mars has look'd the sky to red; 
And peace, the lazy good, is fled. 
Plenty, peace, and pleasure fly; 
         The sprightly green 
In woodland-walks, no more is seen; 
The sprightly green, has drunk the Tyrian dye. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
 Plenty, peace, |&|c. 

MARS 
Sound the trumpet, beat the drum, 
   Through all the world around; 
Sound a reveille, sound, sound, 
The warrior god is come. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
 Sound the trumpet, |&|c. 

MOMUS 
Thy sword within the scabbard keep, 
         And let mankind agree; 
Better the world were fast asleep, 
         Than kept awake by thee. 
The fools are only thinner, 
         With all our cost and care; 
But neither side a winner, 
         For things are as they were. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
 The fools are only, |&|c. 

Enter VENUS 
VENUS 
Calms appear, when storms are past; 
Love will have his hour at last: 
Nature is my kindly care; 
Mars destroys, and I repair; 
Take me, take me, while you may, 
Venus comes not ev'ry day. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
Take her, take her, |&|c. 

CHRONOS 
The world was then so light, 
I scarcely felt the weight; 
Joy rul'd the day, and love the night. 
But since the Queen of Pleasure left the ground, 
         I faint, I lag, 
         And feebly drag 
The pond'rous Orb around. 
All, all of a piece throughout; 

pointing {}} to Diana {}} 
MOMUS, 
Thy chase had a beast in view; 

to Mars 
Thy wars brought nothing about; 

to Venus 
Thy lovers were all untrue. 

JANUS 
'Tis well an old age is out, 
And time to begin a new. 

CHORUS OF ALL 
All, all of a piece throughout; 
Thy chase had a beast in view; 
Thy wars brought nothing about; 
Thy lovers were all untrue. 
'Tis well an old age is out, 
And time to begin a new.

title : Miz Rosa Rides the Bus

That day in December I sat down
 by Miss Muffet of Montgomery.
 I was myriad-weary. Feets swole
 from sewing seams on a filthy fabric;
 tired-sore a pedalin’ the rusty Singer;
  
 dingy cotton thread jammed in the eye.
 All lifelong I’d slide through century-reams
 loathsome with tears. Dreaming my own
 silk-self.
  
 It was not like they all say. Miss Liberty Muffet
 she didn’t
 jump at the sight of me.
 Not exactly.
 They hauled me
 away—a thousand kicking legs pinned down.
  
 The rest of me I tell you—a cloud.
 Beautiful trouble on the dead December
 horizon. Come to sit in judgment.
  
 How many miles as the Jim Crow flies?
 Over oceans and some. I rumbled.
 They couldn’t hold me down. Long.
 No.
  
 My feets were tired. My eyes were
 sore. My heart was raw from hemming
 dirty edges of Miss L. Muffet’s garment.
 I rode again.
  
 A thousand bloody miles after the Crow flies
 that day in December long remembered when I sat down
 beside Miss Muffet of Montgomery.
 I said—like the joke say—What’s in the bowl, Thief?
 I said—That’s your curse.
 I said—This my way.
 She slipped her frock, disembarked,
 settled in the suburbs, deaf, mute, lewd, and blind.
 The bowl she left behind. The empty bowl mine.
 The spoiled dress.
  
 Jim Crow dies and ravens come with crumbs.
 They say—Eat and be satisfied.
 I fast and pray and ride.

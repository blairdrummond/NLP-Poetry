I Was Made Erect and Lone 
Henry David Thoreau 
1817-1862

U.S., New, England
Growing Old, Nature, Living, The Body



I was made erect and lone, 
And within me is the bone; 
Still my vision will be clear, 
Still my life will not be drear, 
To the center all is near. 
Where I sit there is my throne. 
If age choose to sit apart, 
If age choose, give me the start, 
Take the sap and leave the heart.

In May’s gaud gown and ruby reckoning
 the old saw wind repeats a colder thing.
  
 Says, you are the bluest body I ever seen.
 Says, dance that skeletal startle the way I might.
  
 Radius, ulna, a catalogue of flex.
 What do you think you’re grabbing
  
 with those gray hands? What do you think
 you’re hunting, cat-mouth creeling
  
 in the mouseless dawn? Pink as meat
 in the butcher’s tender grip, white as
  
 the opal of a thigh you smut the lie on.
 In May’s red ruse and smattered ravishings
  
 you one, you two, you three your cruder schemes,
 you blanch black lurk and blood the pallid bone
  
 and hum scald need where the body says I am
 and the rose sighs Touch me, I am dying
  
 in the pleatpetal purring of mouthweathered May.

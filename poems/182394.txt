Without even leaving one’s door, One can know the whole world.—Laozi
The rumble of the night sounds 
even in the bright daylight 
of morning. Life blooms amid 
the Ten Thousand Things, but 
does not bloom amid the Ten 
Thousand Things. Shrivel-eyed 
I wake up and tend to the One 
here and now, clamoring to be 
let out. Down with the gate, 
out with the boy, to the rooms 
of life’s necessities, first 
to void and next to fill. 
The Order is only order which 
is disorder, the only Disorder 
is the disorder that is order. 
We usher ourselves, each in our 
own way, back down the way 
for various brushings, combings, 
other groomings. Each in our 
own way we urge the other 
toward some kind of growth: 
one to assume, the other   
to renounce; one to grow larger, 
the other to grow smaller, 
thereby growing larger. Words 
do not work, and when they do not, 
other words might. This makes 
more sense than it seems, works 
more often than it doesn’t, 
except when it really doesn’t, 
and then that disorder creeps 
back in. In five minutes, 
a different challenge. In five 
hours, a different One. Six 
more hours, the One is rubbing 
eyes, untangled like a dragon, 
shucked and undone like an oyster. 
The night slowly rolls abed 
and the words form stories form 
sleep, the sleep of the Ten 
Thousand Things, the sleep 
that will echo the next day 
in the night’s rumbling sounds, 
in the bright light of morning.

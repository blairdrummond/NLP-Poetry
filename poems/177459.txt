title : Camouflaging the Chimera

We tied branches to our helmets. 
We painted our faces & rifles 
with mud from a riverbank, 

blades of grass hung from the pockets 
of our tiger suits. We wove 
ourselves into the terrain, 
content to be a hummingbird’s target. 

We hugged bamboo & leaned 
against a breeze off the river, 
slow-dragging with ghosts 

from Saigon to Bangkok, 
with women left in doorways 
reaching in from America. 
We aimed at dark-hearted songbirds. 

In our way station of shadows 
rock apes tried to blow our cover, 
throwing stones at the sunset. Chameleons 

crawled our spines, changing from day 
to night: green to gold, 
gold to black. But we waited 
till the moon touched metal, 

till something almost broke 
inside us. VC struggled 
with the hillside, like black silk 

wrestling iron through grass. 
We weren’t there. The river ran 
through our bones. Small animals took refuge 
against our bodies; we held our breath, 

ready to spring the L-shaped 
ambush, as a world revolved 
under each man’s eyelid.

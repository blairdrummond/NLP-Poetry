title : Charlie Chaplin Impersonates a Poet

author : Cornelius Eady

text : 
The stage is set for imminent disaster.   
Here is the little tramp, standing   
On a stack of books in order 
To reach the microphone, the 
Poet he’s impersonating somehow   
Trussed and mumbling in a 
Tweed bundle at his feet. 

He opens his mouth: Tra-la! 
Out comes doves, incandescent bulbs,   
Plastic roses. Well, that’s that, 
Squirms the young professor who’s   
Coordinated this, 
No more visiting poets! 

His department head groans   
For the trap door. As it   
Swings away 

The tramp keeps on as if   
Nothing has occurred,   
A free arm mimicking   
A wing.

title : From Our Correspondent in: Theatre Square, Dresden

author : Valerio Magrelli

text : 
Don't let's hang about 
on the cobblestones. 
The equestrian statue—keep 
going—represents the king. 
Yes, the Dante translator. 
Now let's move on. 
Lovely theatre, first rate, but 
no point in dawdling 
because this paving is contaminated 
(a nuclear accident 
near the quarry) and here we are 
already like ghosts on this X-ray plate, like ghouls, 
radiological tourists, little glass vessels 
blown with a breeze of electrons.

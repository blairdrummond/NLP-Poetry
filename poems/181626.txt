title : Bird at the Window

author : Sophie Cabot Black

text : 
Beyond is a brightness 
I am not equal to 

Yet what I see   
Turns into what I want, 

And to bring nothing but this body 
To pass through 

The one thing between   
Myself and what I crave, 

Almost done, the world a ruin   
Of leaves, winter at the throat, 

My song over and over until   
So familiar I can do 

What I am about to do 
While you who rise from the table 

And walk from room to room 
Will remember only the sound 

Of what cast herself through 
All that glass, instead of the song 

That was sung until finally 
You would ask to know more.

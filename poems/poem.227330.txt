CHORUS 
Come we shepherds whose blest sight 
Hath met love's noon in nature's night; 
Come lift we up our loftier song 
And wake the sun that lies too long. 

To all our world of well-stol'n joy 
       He slept, and dreamt of no such thing, 
While we found out heav'n's fairer eye, 
       And kiss'd the cradle of our King. 
Tell him he rises now too late 
To show us aught worth looking at. 

Tell him we now can show him more 
       Than he e'er show'd to mortal sight, 
Than he himself e'er saw before, 
       Which to be seen needs not his light. 
Tell him, Tityrus, where th' hast been; 
Tell him, Thyrsis, what th' hast seen. 

       TITYRUS 
Gloomy night embrac'd the place 
       Where the Noble Infant lay; 
The Babe look'd up and show'd his face, 
       In spite of darkness, it was day. 
It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise 
Not from the east, but from thine eyes. 

       CHORUS 
It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise 
Not from the east, but from thine eyes. 

       THYRSIS 
Winter chid aloud, and sent 
       The angry North to wage his wars; 
The North forgot his fierce intent, 
       And left perfumes instead of scars. 
By those sweet eyes' persuasive pow'rs, 
Where he meant frost, he scatter'd flow'rs. 

       CHORUS 
By those sweet eyes' persuasive pow'rs, 
Where he meant frost, he scatter'd flow'rs. 

       BOTH 
We saw thee in thy balmy nest, 
       Young dawn of our eternal day! 
We saw thine eyes break from their east 
       And chase the trembling shades away. 
We saw thee, and we bless'd the sight, 
We saw thee by thine own sweet light. 

       TITYRUS 
Poor World, said I, what wilt thou do 
       To entertain this starry stranger? 
Is this the best thou canst bestow, 
       A cold, and not too cleanly, manger? 
Contend, ye powers of heav'n and earth, 
To fit a bed for this huge birth. 

       CHORUS 
Contend, ye powers of heav'n and earth, 
To fit a bed for this huge birth. 

       THYRSIS 
Proud World, said I, cease your contest, 
       And let the Mighty Babe alone; 
The phoenix builds the phoenix' nest, 
       Love's architecture is his own; 
The Babe whose birth embraves this morn, 
Made his own bed ere he was born. 

       CHORUS 
The Babe whose birth embraves this morn, 
Made his own bed ere he was born. 

       TITYRUS 
I saw the curl'd drops, soft and slow, 
       Come hovering o'er the place's head, 
Off'ring their whitest sheets of snow 
       To furnish the fair Infant's bed. 
Forbear, said I, be not too bold; 
   Your fleece is white, but 'tis too cold. 

       CHORUS 
Forbear, said I, be not too bold; 
Your fleece is white, but 'tis too cold. 

       THYRSIS 
I saw the obsequious Seraphims 
       Their rosy fleece of fire bestow; 
For well they now can spare their wings, 
       Since Heav'n itself lies here below. 
Well done, said I, but are you sure 
Your down so warm will pass for pure? 

       CHORUS 
Well done, said I, but are you sure 
Your down so warm will pass for pure? 

       TITYRUS 
No no, your King's not yet to seek 
       Where to repose his royal head; 
See see, how soon his new-bloom'd cheek 
       'Twixt's mother's breasts is gone to bed. 
Sweet choice, said we! no way but so, 
Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow. 

       CHORUS 
Sweet choice, said we! no way but so, 
Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow. 

       BOTH 
We saw thee in thy balmy nest, 
       Bright dawn of our eternal day! 
We saw thine eyes break from their east, 
       And chase the trembling shades away. 
We saw thee, and we bless'd the sight, 
We saw thee, by thine own sweet light. 

       CHORUS 
We saw thee, and we bless'd the sight, 
We saw thee, by thine own sweet light. 

       FULL CHORUS 
Welcome, all wonders in one sight! 
       Eternity shut in a span; 
Summer in winter; day in night; 
       Heaven in earth, and God in man. 
Great little one, whose all-embracing birth 
Lifts earth to heaven, stoops heav'n to earth. 

Welcome; though nor to gold nor silk, 
       To more than Caesar's birthright is; 
Two sister seas of virgin-milk, 
       With many a rarely temper'd kiss, 
That breathes at once both maid and mother, 
Warms in the one, cools in the other. 

Welcome, though not to those gay flies 
       Gilded i' th' beams of earthly kings, 
Slippery souls in smiling eyes; 
       But to poor shepherds, homespun things, 
Whose wealth's their flock, whose wit, to be 
Well read in their simplicity. 

Yet when young April's husband-show'rs 
       Shall bless the fruitful Maia's bed, 
We'll bring the first-born of her flow'rs 
       To kiss thy feet and crown thy head. 
To thee, dread Lamb! whose love must keep 
The shepherds more than they the sheep. 

To thee, meek Majesty! soft King 
       Of simple graces and sweet loves, 
Each of us his lamb will bring, 
       Each his pair of silver doves; 
Till burnt at last in fire of thy fair eyes, 
Ourselves become our own best sacrifice.

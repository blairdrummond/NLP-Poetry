text : 
Before anything could happen, 
flecks of real gold 
on her mouth, her eyes more 
convex than any others, 
the ground spoke, the barrier 
of lilacs spoke. What sang 
in the black tree was entirely gold. 
Her chair was empty. 

New absence is a great figure 
dark as the underskin of fruit. 
At the center of the earth 
it surrounds and amplifies the dead 
whose music never slows down. 

She came by car. I came by train. 
We embraced. It was 
at the foot of a hill steeply 
crowned with apples 
and a ruined fortress. 
Imagination did not make the world. 

Sweetness is the entire portion. 
Before anything could happen, 
happiness, the necessary 
precondition of the world, 
spoke and flowered over the hill. 

When I was in Hell 
on the ruined palisade, 
either mystery or loneliness 
kissed my open eyes. 

It felt hugely convex, seeing 
and immediately forgetting. 

By contrast, what I imagined 
later was nothing.

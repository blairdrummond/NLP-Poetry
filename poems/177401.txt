title : The Fall of Troy

author : Rachel Hadas

text : 
Sing now the heavy furniture of the fall, 
the journey’s ending. Strong Aeneas bears   
deep on his shoulders all the dark wood chairs   
and tables of destruction. Bruising, blunt,   
they force his feet on up the war-scraped hills   
past raped dead temples. All Achilles kills   
litters the trail of sofa legs with other   
endings of houses. Further up, gods sit   
changing their own upholsteries of deceit,   
ordaining shelves and benches as the goal   
of his dim voyage. Sometimes arrows drawn   
on chair backs point the way they must go on,   
signs that some corridor of destiny 
is reserving him a threshold. Aeneas weeps   
at wind or passion, but steadfastly keeps 
carrying battered merchandise marked ROME 
in one direction, pondering it all.

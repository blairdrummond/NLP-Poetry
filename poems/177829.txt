In the beginning was the word 
And the word was 
Death 
And the word was nigger 
And the word was death to all niggers   
And the word was death to all life   
And the word was death to all 
   peace be still 

The genesis was life   
The genesis was death   
In the genesis of death   
Was the genesis of war 
   be still peace be still 

In the name of peace   
They waged the wars   
   ain’t they got no shame 

In the name of peace 
Lot’s wife is now a product of the Morton company   
   nah, they ain’t got no shame 

Noah packing his wife and kiddies up for a holiday   
row row row your boat 
But why’d you leave the unicorns, noah 
Huh? why’d you leave them 
While our Black Madonna stood there 
Eighteen feet high holding Him in her arms   
Listening to the rumblings of peace 
    be still be still 

CAN I GET A WITNESS? WITNESS? WITNESS? 
He wanted to know 
And peter only asked who is that dude? 
Who is that Black dude? 
Looks like a troublemaker to me 
And the foundations of the mighty mighty          
Ro Man Cat holic church were laid 

   hallelujah Jesus 
   nah, they ain’t got no shame 

Cause they killed the Carthaginians   
in the great appian way 
And they killed the Moors 
“to civilize a nation” 
And they just killed the earth 
And blew out the sun 
In the name of a god 
Whose genesis was white 
And war wooed god 
And america was born 
Where war became peace 
And genocide patriotism 
And honor is a happy slave 
cause all god’s chillun need rhythm 
And glory hallelujah why can’t peace 
   be still 

The great emancipator was a bigot   
   ain’t they got no shame 
And making the world safe for democracy 
Were twenty millon slaves 
   nah, they ain’t got no shame 

And they barbecued six million 
To raise the price of beef 
And crossed the 38th parallel 
To control the price of rice 
   ain’t we never gonna see the light 

And champagne was shipped out of the East   
While kosher pork was introduced 
To Africa 
   Only the torch can show the way 

In the beginning was the deed   
And the deed was death 

And the honkies are getting confused   
   peace be still 

So the great white prince 
Was shot like a nigger in texas 
And our Black shining prince was murdered   
like that thug in his cathedral 
While our nigger in memphis 
was shot like their prince in dallas 
And my lord 
ain’t we never gonna see the light 
The rumblings of this peace must be stilled   
   be stilled be still 

ahh Black people   
ain’t we got no pride?

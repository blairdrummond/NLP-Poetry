title : Almost Ashore

author : Gerald Vizenor

text : 
winter sea
over my shoes
shadows
and bright 
round stones
at san gregorio

every wave
turns a season
forests adrift 
empty shells
memory of fire
so faraway
in the mountains
and canyons

silent pools
raise my faces
by early tide
slight my hand
shoulders 
almost ashore

light breaks
over the plovers
certain steps
my traces
blood, bone, stone
turn natural
and heavy waves
rush the sand

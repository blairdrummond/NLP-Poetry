title : Skin Canoes

Swallows carve lake wind, 
trailers lined up, fish tins. 
The fires of a thousand small camps   
spilled on a hillside. 

I pull leeks, morels from the soil, 
fry chubs from the lake in moonlight.   
I hear someone, hear the splash, groan   
of a waterpump, wipe my mouth.   
Fish grease spits at darkness. 

Once I nudged a canoe through that water,   
letting its paddle lift, drip. 
I was sucked down smaller than the sound   
of the dropping, looked out 
from where I had vanished.

I. Deer Season
  
 The quiet of windows pours its sand in my ear.
 What, what? ask the dolls of evening
  
 though they do not wish to hear my answer.
 Five hens are alive in the brush, purring
  
 toward the slough. No one here has a rifle
 but the wind turns abruptly and returns a report.
  
 Three bright orange vests hang at the ready.
 The doe turns in her frame above the stove,
  
 and her season climbs like the moon into its place
 in the sky’s clock. The green theater
  
 with it’s elegant aspens goes more threadbare
 each week, so I’ll soon see the others, heretofore
  
 only heard. Just to the south the casino lights
 ride the underbellies of clouds, and further
  
 down the interstate more world twirls
 in its paper and drinks, while the baby throws
  
 his feet through the bars, and the father
 takes him like a little canoe on the billowy
  
 lake of his chest. Comes a mewling, then,
 from my dark, a mooing, a whine, feathered
  
 or furred I can’t divine. The girl with the flat face
 and bleached lips read her poems in crisp
  
 Ivy League whatnot, but I got sidetracked
 by the way her torso seemed stacked, pressed
  
 in layers like shale, so there was a weight to her
 that hung in the bottom of the eye like the bulk
  
 of a tear that never quite falls. It’s true
 the intelligence was clear as green ice, and just
  
 as hard, stripped of its I and heat. Her baby
 burbled on in the back of the room happily not
  
 in the poems. Oh little rabbit of grief on the spot
 where the last dog was turned under, don’t speak.
  
 I make a fire, then dream a fire: wind carries
 its gray rags into the woods, and the crackling
  
 in the grate enters my ducts, wakes me.
 When I look out, the grass along the fence
  
 is crawling with light, and the last wild asters
 press their blue buttons into the cold glass.
  
  
 II. The New Year
  
 Zero and a fine hard snow burns
 when it hits bare skin. A white
  
 ridge glows inside the birches
 across the slough where snow articulates
  
 the distance. Where water moves,
 where the land heaves. I haul oak chunks
  
 in a plastic sled. When I bend to stack
 the splits, my breasts pop and burn,
  
 and my child’s face rises like a bird
 razoring its shadow over the snow.
  
 Wind takes the rag of some old self
 and shakes it at me. The heart is only
  
 another shape the view stretches to include.
 Birches march out of the hardwoods
  
 with their white waists radiant, so many
 clones on one taproot. A jay circles
  
 the full feeders fending off smaller birds.
 I make this vocal gesture because self
  
 is simply one edge of me. Out here
 there’s only an economy of wood burned
  
 or to be burned, how much water’s left
 in the tank, how hard or soft the light.
  
 Degrees and drafts. This room and everything in it
 are mine, and though I try to be selfish and grim,
  
 my child has made me enduringly plural,
 more than I, but not quite we.
  
 Black-capped chickadees flee
 from three big jays at the feeder. Shrieking
  
 and diving in the strong winter light, the jays
 are not actually blue. Their feathers refract light
  
 so they appear blue. Self-luminous,
 hardy and belligerent as pronouns.
  
  
 III. Easter
  
 The kick of the screw finding purchase in pine
 slams my wrist bone, elbow and shoulder,
 but it’s in, and the panel is up. Now another
 and another until the wall is flush. I mark
  
 and cut each length with the small tooth
 of the new jigsaw my husband thought
 I should have. Two days apart from him
 and the child, I’ve forgotten the pump
  
 to empty my breasts, so the saw’s jump
 at the end of the cut draws the burning
 up. And with it a guilt as bright as the room
 where I drive plank after plank against the studs,
  
 each a satisfaction against the body’s wish
 to be elsewhere. Even into the night, I can’t put
 down my drill. I stoke the fire and drive 
 more screws, loving the growl when they’re
  
 in as far as they’ll go. The mind arranging
 which planks and trim tomorrow, next week
 and spring. Even my sleep is a cutting and fastening
 broken by my turning on the full globes
  
 of my breasts. So toward morning I dream
 of parties given by women I used to know,
 and to which I’m not and will never be invited,
 trays of fancy sandwiches and petit fours,
  
 half moon glasses of seething champagne.

America is inconceivable without drugs 
and always has been. One of the first acts 
was to dump the tea. The drug that furnished 
the mansions of Virginia was tobacco, 
a drug now in much disrepute. 
Sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for 
and they dealt it by the bale altho it 
was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire— 
people were so simple in those days. 
The Civil War saw the isolation of morphine 
making amputation a pleasure and making 
the block of wood between the teeth, 
which was no drug, obsolete. Morphinism 
was soon widespread among doctors and patients. 
At this date interns, the reports tell us, 
are among the premier drug ab/users 
of said moralistic nation. “Rock” stars 
(who notoriously “have” doctors) 
consume drugs by the metric ton 
even as they urge teenagers to Say No. 
The undercurrent of American history 
has been the running aches and pains 
of the worn path to the door of the apothecary 
to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs 
by the gallon. It has been all prone 
all seeking Florida, Ponce de León 
was just the beginning of a statistical curve 
whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo. 
His eager search for youth has become our 
frantic tilt with death and boredom, 
in fact we are farming death in Florida 
with far greater profit than we are 
farming food in Iowa—elixirs are as multiform 
as the life-style frauds we implore, 
a cultural patchwork fit for a fool 
in the only country in the world 
with a shop called the Drug Store.

title : My Father Holds the Door for Yoko Ono

author : Christopher Chambers

text : 
In New York City for a conference 
on weed control, leaving the hotel 
in a cluster of horticulturalists, 
he alone stops, midwestern, crewcut, 
narrow blue tie, cufflinks, wingtips, 
holds the door for the Asian woman 
in a miniskirt and thigh high 
white leather boots. She nods 
slightly, a sad and beautiful gesture. 
Neither smile, as if performing 
a timeless ritual, as if anticipating 
the loss of a son or a lover. 

Years later, Christmas, inexplicably 
he dons my mother’s auburn wig, 
my brother’s wire-rimmed glasses, 
and strikes a pose clowning 
with my second hand acoustic guitar. 
He is transformed, a working class hero 
and a door whispers shut, 
like cherry blossoms falling.

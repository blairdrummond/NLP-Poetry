loaded like spoons
 into the belly of Jesus
 where we lay for weeks for months
 in the sweat and stink
 of our own breathing
 Jesus
 why do you not protect us
 chained to the heart of the Angel
 where the prayers we never tell
 and hot and red
 as our bloody ankles
 Jesus
 Angel
 can these be men
 who vomit us out from ships
 called Jesus    Angel    Grace of God
 onto a heathen country
 Jesus
 Angel
 ever again
 can this tongue speak
 can these bones walk
 Grace Of God
 can this sin live

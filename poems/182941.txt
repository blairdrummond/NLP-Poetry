title : Winter Journal: Fish Rises, Dark Brown Muscle Turns Over

author : Emily Wilson

text : 
rings diminish, duck reflects flight then threads off 
Long branch of land, rusted oaks smoldering 
       fawn shore, grasses bare scripts of green 
       black fingerbones of the willows, splayed 
       rubric fringe of the reeds at the edge of water 
The reflection is its own blurred dream 
The blended edges, furred thing 
tawny path of stalks brushed into gray slope behind 
Bright yellow mostly gone now, the dominance 
       of dulled bronze, ochrous, ferrous grooves of 
       the several oaks 
The wrought planes and hinges of things 
Strange, held-off symmetry, axis of waterline 
       rubbed, smeared, edge-shifted 
What is real then made more so through 
       an intervention of element 
The chipmunk’s tail jerks in synch with its mouth-pops 
Stares hard at me from a dead willow stump 
Who are you and what have you done? 
Things moving in the leaves behind me. 
Dog barks from far across fields 
Single bird oars across lake 
The sky deep in: dark oxygens 
crimp of leaf edging in dried weed stalk 
miniature seedpods held forward 
calligraphic against gray water, white stones 
chipmunk-rustle, upturn duff, chirp storm whirl off, hold still 
       hold still 
Gravity picks and fidgets 

How each blade and bract is angled just so 
       arches, etched kerns 
       scroll of deft beech leaf 
       Baroque script of dried vines 
       their wall of texture coming down 
Crows burr into woods 
fish plinks through and slacks under 
ducks quilt across sky, through sky-water 
mottled beads hovering, unchaining 
Reflection is a real thing set 
       in perpetual motion, as if electron 
       spinning and jittering made visible 
       the static progressions 
The waving laminations of white stone 
the wandering rift through 
the pulse-veins 
Breathing thing, made to breathe, graven so 

Now the delicate hammers 
pure cuts of bird 
steel rings reassembling 
Quit path under oak 
Something moves off a dark road 
Deep-embroidered quiet 
the tickets slip 
thicket in 
meter-tick of duck taking off 
       keep close, brush close to surface 
       furl between bird and mirror-bird 
I am vested in sensation 
a suspension of yellow maple amid stalks of oak 
       distillate of leaves 
       saffron particulate 
Deep sea of trees, fanned tops of oak corals, collective bend 
fast tappers high up 
flapping across water 
back up the damp trough 
trees closing in 
two deer pick across, turn back 
       clatter through woods 
       encircling

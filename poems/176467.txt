title : Reflections on History in Missouri

author : Constance Urdang

text : 
This old house lodges no ghosts!
Those swaggering specters who found their way 
Across the Atlantic
Were left behind
With their old European grudges 
In the farmhouses of New England 
And Pennsylvania
Like so much jettisoned baggage 
Too heavy
To lug over the Piedmont.

The flatlands are inhospitable
To phantoms. Here
Shadows are sharp and arbitrary
Not mazy, obscure, 
Cowering in corners
Behind scary old boots in a cupboard
Or muffled in empty coats, deserted
By long-dead cousins
(Who appear now and then
But only in photographs 
Already rusting at the edges)Â—

Setting out in the creaking wagon 
Tight-lipped, alert to move on, 
The old settlers had no room 
For illusions.
Their dangers were real.
Now in the spare square house 
Their great-grandchildren
Tidy away the past
Until the polished surfaces
Reflect not apparitions, pinched, 
Parched, craving, unsatisfied, 
But only their own faces.

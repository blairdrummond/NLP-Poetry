title : Beautiful Dreamer Serenade

author : Stephen C. Foster

text : 
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, 
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee; 
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, 
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd a way! 

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, 
List while I woo thee with soft melody; 
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,— 
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! 
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me! 

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea 
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie; 
Over the streamlet vapors are borne, 
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn. 

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart, 
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea; 
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,— 
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! 
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

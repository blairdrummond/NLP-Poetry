     Christopher Robin
      Had wheezles
      And sneezles,
      They bundled him
      Into
      His bed.
      They gave him what goes
      With a cold in the nose,
      And some more for a cold
      In the head.
      They wondered
      If wheezles
      Could turn
      Into measles,
      If sneezles
      Would turn
      Into mumps;
      They examined his chest
      For a rash,
      and the rest 
      Of his body for swellings and lumps.
      They sent for some doctors
      In sneezles
      And wheezles
      To tell them what ought
      To be done.

      All sorts of conditions
      Of famous physicians
      Came hurrying round
      At a run.
      They all made a note
      Of the state of his throat,
      They asked if he suffered from thirst;
      They asked if the sneezles
      Came after the wheezles,
      Or if the first sneezle
      Came first.
      They said, "If you teazle
      A sneezle
      Or wheezle,
      A measle
      May easily grow.
      But humour or pleazle
      The wheezle
      Or sneezle,
      The measle
      Will certainly go."
      They expounded the reazles
      For sneezles
      And wheezles,
      The manner of measles
      When new.
      They said, "If he freezles
      In draughts and in breezles,
      Then PHTHEEZLES
      May even ensue."
  
Christopher Robin
Got up in the morning,
The sneezles had vanished away.
And the look in his eye
Seemed to say to the sky,
"Now, how to amuse them today?"

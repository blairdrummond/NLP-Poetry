text : 
The heavy, wet, guttural 
small-plane engine 
fights for air, and goes down in humid darkness   
about where the airport should be. 
I take a lot for granted, 
not pleased to be living under the phlegm- 
soaked, gaseous, foggy and irradiated 
heavens whose angels wear collars in propjets   
and live elsewhere in Clean Zones, 
but figuring the air is full of sorrows. 

I don’t blame 
the quick use of the entire earth 
on the boozy 
pilot 
come down to get a dose of cobalt 
for his cancer. He’s got 
a little life left, if 
he doesn’t have to take all day to reach it.   
With the black patches 
inside him, and 
the scars and the streaks and the sick stomach, 

his life is more and more like 
that of the lowliest child chimney sweep   
in the mind of the great insensible,   
William Blake. William Blake, 
the repeated one, Blake, half mad, 
half remembered, 
who knew his anatomy, down to 
the little-observed muscle in the shoulder   
that lifts the wing. 

The little London chimney sweeper 
reaches up and reaches down. 
In his back, 
every vertebra is separated from the long 
hours of stretching. 
With one deep, tired breath, 
the lungs go black. 

By the Holiday Company crane,   
adding a level to the hospital, 
on the highest land in the county,   
heavy sits the pure-white Air Care   
helicopter, with 
its bulging eye. 
It has kept many going, a good buy,   
something. 

Now someone I know says Blake   
in anger, 
angry for his brother in the factory   
and his sister on the ward, 
but tonight I have no more anger   
than the muscle 
that lifts my knee when I walk. 

Another pleads with the ocean 
that the words for 
suffering and trouble 
take place in a sound that will be all sounds   
and in the tidal roll 
of all our lives and every event, 
but I am silent by water, 

and am less to such power   
than a failed lung. 

And I think it is only a clever trick to know   
that one thing may be contained 
in another. Hence, 
Blake in the sweep, one in the ground   
in one in the air, 
myself in the clinic for runaway cells,   
now and later.

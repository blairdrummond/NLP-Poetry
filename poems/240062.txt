title : Through a Glass

author : Chana Bloch

text : 
On the crown of his head 
where the fontanelle pulsed 
between spongy bones, 
a bald spot is forming, globed and sleek 
as a monk’s tonsure.

I was the earliest pinch of civilization, 
the one who laced him 
into shoe leather 
when he stumbled into walking upright. 
“Shoes are unfair to children,” he’d grouse.

Through a pane of glass 
that shivers when the wind kicks up 
I watch my son walk away.

He’s out the door, up the street, around 
a couple of corners by now. 
I’m in for life. 
He trips; my hand flies out;

I yank it back.

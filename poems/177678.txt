title : Why I Might Go to the Next Football Game

sometimes you know   
things: once at a   
birthday party a little 

girl looked at her new party 
gloves and said she 
liked me, making suddenly the light much   
brighter so that the very small 

hairs shone above her lip. i felt 
stuffed, like a swimming pool, with   
words, like i knew something that was in   
a great tangled knot. and when we sat 

down i saw there were 
tiny glistenings on her 
legs, too. i knew 
something for sure then. but it 

was too big, or like the outside too   
everywhere, or maybe 
hiding inside, behind 
the bicycles where i later 

kissed her, not using my tongue. it was   
too giant and thin to squirm 
into, and be so well inside of, or 
too well hidden to punch, and feel. a few 

days later on the asphalt playground i   
tackled her. she skinned her 
elbow, and i even 
punched her and felt her, felt 

how soft the hairs were. i thought 
that i would make a fine football-playing   
poet, but now i know 
it is better to be an old, breathing 

man wrapped in a great coat in the stands, who   
remains standing after each play, who knows   
something, who rotates in his place 
rasping over and over the thing 

he knows: “whydidnhe pass? the other   
end was wide open! the end 
was wide open! the end was wide open . . . ”

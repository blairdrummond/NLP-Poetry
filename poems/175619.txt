title : The Miscarriage

Some species can crack pavement with their shoots 
to get their share of sun some species lay 
a purple froth of eggs and leave it there 
to sprinkle tidepools with tadpole confetti 
some species though you stomp them in the carpet   
have already stashed away the families 
that will inherit every floor at midnight 
But others don’t go forth and multiply 
as boldly male and female peeling the bamboo 
their keepers watching in despair or those 
endangered species numbered individually 
and mapped from perch to oblivious perch 

For weeks the world it seemed was plagued   
with babies forests dwindling into cradles   
rows of women hissing for an obstetrician   
babies no one could feed babies received 
by accident like misdirected mail 
from God so many babies people hired 
women to hold them babies babies everywhere 
but not a one to name When we got home   
the local news showed us a mother with   
quintuplets she was suckling them in shifts 
a mountain of sheets universally admired   
a goddess of fertility her smile   
could persuade the skies to rain Her litter   
slept ointment-eyed in pink wool caps while Dad 
ran his hand through his hair thinking maybe   
of money as he stood surveying his 
crowded living room his wealth of heartbeats 

Pizza and pop that night and there unasked inside 
the bottlecap was Sorry—Try Again 
you set it down and did not speak of it 
the moon flanked by her brood of stars that night 
a chaste distracted kiss goodnight that night 
your body quiet having spilled its secret 
your palms flat on your belly holding holding 

Forgive me if I had no words that night 
but I was wondering in the silence still 
begetting silence whether to console you 
if I consoled you it would make the loss 
your loss and so we laid beside ourselves 
a while because I had no words until 
our bodies folded shut our bodies closed 
around hope like a book preserving petals 
a book we did not open till the morning when 
we found hope dry and brittle but intact

Refrain, Couplet

I heard an Angel singing 
When the day was springing 
Mercy Pity Peace 
Is the worlds release 

Thus he sung all day 
Over the new mown hay 
Till the sun went down 
And haycocks looked brown 

I heard a Devil curse 
Over the heath & the furze 
Mercy could be no more 
If there was nobody poor 

And pity no more could be 
If all were as happy as we 
At his curse the sun went down 
And the heavens gave a frown 

Down pourd the heavy rain 
Over the new reapd grain 
And Miseries increase 
Is Mercy Pity Peace

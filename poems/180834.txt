title : The Posture

author : Lucretius

text : 
Of like importance is the posture too, 
In which the genial feat of Love we do: 
For as the females of the four foot kind, 
Receive the leapings of their Males behind; 
So the good Wives, with loins uplifted high, 
And leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try: 
For in that posture will they best conceive: 
Not when supinely laid they frisk and heave; 
For active motions only break the blow, 
And more of Strumpets than of Wives they show; 
When answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow. 
Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound, 
Throws off the Plow-share from the furrow’d ground. 
But common Harlots in conjunction heave, 
Because ’tis less their business to conceive 
Than to delight, and to provoke the deed; 
A trick which honest Wives but little need.

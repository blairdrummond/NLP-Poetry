title : [if your complexion is a mess]

text : 
if your complexion is a mess 
our elixir spells skin success 
you’ll have appeal bewitch be adored 
hechizando con crema dermoblanqueadora 

what we sell is enlightenment 
nothing less than beauty itself 
since when can be seen in the dark 
what shines hidden in dirt 

double dutch darky 
take kisses back to Africa 
they dipped you in a vat 
at the wacky chocolate factory 

color we’ve got in spades 
melanin gives perpetual shade 
though rhythm’s no answer to cancer 
pancakes pale and butter can get rancid

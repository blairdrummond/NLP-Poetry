text : 
I rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper. 
From the rock face footed a dancer white through red. 
    My family gave me over 
    to it, gone for the river. 

Were I a peasant harvesting grapes near Beaune 
in the last century, even, I might have dreamed 
    a saint lifting off for Arles, 
    Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, 

and knowing about cannon in that long peace, 
might have been troubled therefore that my flier 
    hauled a magnum of the best 
    and bloodied the west sky with it 

and vanished. My fisting that loose sheet in place 
was secretarial, not visionary! 
    Already in that decade 
    small tribes entered the void 

like windows on a skyscraper when the bent 
janitor makes his way. But those flick back on 
    each night, costly difference. 
    It is not only portents 

in dream or flapping images of the gone 
or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised 
    that catch like undertow 
    the foot in tide-rip toeing 

down the singing or remembered beach. 
We study populations in the forests, 
    we hold the paper flat, 
    mark, note, warn—the dictated 

prophecies do their work, we do some work— 
cut horn from rhinos so they won’t be poached. 
    But, to go on from there, 
    one needs to stand in the doorway 

some evening and feel the air as if it were fire 
pulling illusionlessly, letting the draw 
    of one fact heat its chain 
    of links, such as, Japan 

clear-cutting forests in Siberia 
where tigers not already harvested 
    lope their dwindling range, 
    two hundred as the hinge 

for their growled arc of existence, bones of the others 
ground to powders for old men’s potencies. 
    One needs to feel the tug 
    of the draft on skin, the drag 

of process utterly anciently itself. 
Faster, now, the pull is from birth through dwelling through 
    dissolution, along lines 
    streaming through us, ageless winds.

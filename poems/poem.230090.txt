Epigram, Rhymed Stanza

The princess in her world-old tower pined   
A prisoner, brazen-caged, without a gleam   
Of sunlight, or a windowful of wind; 
She lived but in a long lamp-lighted dream. 

They brought her forth at last when she was old;   
The sunlight on her blanched hair was shed   
Too late to turn its silver into gold. 
"Ah, shield me from this brazen glare!" she said.

title : Music Is Time

author : Jill Bialosky

text : 
Music is time, said the violin master. 
You can’t miss the stop or you’ll miss the train. 
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, 
one, two, three, four. 
 
She clapped her hands together 
as the boy moved the bow across the strings. 
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, 
one, two, three, four, the violin master shouted, 
 
louder and more shrill so that her voice 
traveled through the house like a metronome, 
guiding him, commanding him to translate the beat, 
to trust his own internal rhythm. 
 
Good boy, she said. 
See how hard you have to be on yourself? 
How will your violin know who you are 
unless you make it speak?

IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON EVER THEN HEY
 I AM HERE IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK SOMETIME
 INFOMERCIALS HAVE STARTED AND I KIND OF WANT TO DIE
 I’M PRETTY SURE THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY FOR A MORGUE
  
 OK SO ACTUALLY IT’S FOR THE BIBLE OR SOMETHING
 SO IT’S A COMMERICAL FOR TRYING TO BE HAPPY OR SOMETHING
 BUT I AM NOT HAPPY TONIGHT NO I AM NOT JUST HERE
 IF HAPPINESS EVER WORKED THEN HOW—I DON’T KNOW
  
 HAPPINESS IS A LIZARD IN THE SUNLIGHT GETTING WARM
 AND THEN IN THE NIGHT BENEATH A ROCK EATING FLIES
 AND SWALLLOWING THE MEAT OF THE TRASH OF THE DIRT
  
 AH, SO TONIGHT IS A LITTLE DRUNK AND OK OK OK
 THAT IS GOOD SO LET ME BE—THERE IS NO LOVE TONIGHT
 GOD IS LIKE BONO—SOME DICKWAD NO ONE WILL EVER MEET OR LIKE

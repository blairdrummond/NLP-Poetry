title : The Unruly Child

author : Bob Perelman

text : 
There is a company called Marathon Oil, mother, 
Very far away and very big and, again, very 
Desirable. Who isn’t? Back connecting pure dots, 
Fleecy intelligence lapped in explanatory sound 
The faces make difficult. 

Learn the language. 
That beautiful tongue-in-cheek hostage situation: 
My mind, up close, in pjs, and I use it. 
Wanting to fuck an abstraction nine times in a row, 
Continuous melismata, don’t stop, don’t stop, no name, no picture. 

There is a series of solids, mother, 
Called people, who rise to the transparent obtainable 
Solo windows, mornings, afternoons, 
And there are military operations called 
Operation Patio, Operation Menu. 

It is the individuals who finally get the feel of the tenses. 
So that it may snow, has to snow on the muddy corpse. 
There is a boundary, mother, very far away and very 
Continuous, broken, to interrogate civilians, the self, 
The text, networks of viewers found wanting a new way 
To cook chicken, why not?, to kill while falling asleep. 
There is the one language not called money, and the other not called explosions.

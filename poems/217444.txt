title : The Lake

author : Sophie Cabot Black

text : 
Day and night, the lake dreams of sky. 
A privacy as old as the mountains 
And her up there, stuck among peaks. The   whole eye 

Fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars, 
So little trespass. An airplane once 
Crossed her brow; she searched but could not find 

A face. Having lived with such strict beauty 
She comes to know how the sun is nothing 
But itself and the path it throws; the moon 

A riddled stone. If only a hand 
Would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. Even the elk 
Pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below— 

How she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves 
Her, as it sings all the way down the mountain.

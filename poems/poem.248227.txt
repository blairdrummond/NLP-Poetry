Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

I love you, great new Titan! 
 Am I not you? 
 Napoleon and Caesar 
 Out of you grew. 
  
 Out of unthinkable torture, 
 Eyes kissed by death, 
 Won back to the world again, 
 Lost and won in a breath, 
  
 Cruel men are made immortal. 
 Out of your pain born, 
 They have stolen the sun's power 
 With their feet on your shoulders worn. 
  
 Let them shrink from your girth, 
 That has outgrown the pallid days 
 When you slept like Circe's swine 
 Or a word in the brain's ways.

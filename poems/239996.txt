title : XLIV from The Arab Apocalypse

author : Etel Adnan

text : 
Where do you want ghosts to reside?
In our wakeful hours there are flowers which produce nightmares
We burned continents of silence   the future of nations
the breathing of the fighters got thicker   became like oxen’s

there is in that breath sparkles of scorched flesh and the fainting of stars

we crucify Gilgamesh on a TANK Viking II reaches Mars
Imam Ali dances over a nuclear blast
cursed are the clouds which repel water
cursed are the Arabs who fell tall and haggard eucalyptus trees

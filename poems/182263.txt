title : Left to Itself the Heart Could Almost Melt, Mend

author : Jill Osier

text : 
When the Amish girl gets off the bus 
she walks over and stomps 
her small black boot into a drift 
in front of McDonald's.    
She is maybe new to winter   
this far north and wants to know   
its depth. Its give. Oh,   
be careful. It already has you   
by the night of your dress,   
violet-black with white-dotted print.

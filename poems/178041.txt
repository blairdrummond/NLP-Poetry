title : Song for the Last Act

text : 
Now that I have your face by heart, I look   
Less at its features than its darkening frame   
Where quince and melon, yellow as young flame,   
Lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd’s crook.   
Beyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease 
The lead and marble figures watch the show   
Of yet another summer loath to go 
Although the scythes hang in the apple trees. 

Now that I have your face by heart, I look. 

Now that I have your voice by heart, I read   
In the black chords upon a dulling page   
Music that is not meant for music’s cage, 
Whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.   
The staves are shuttled over with a stark   
Unprinted silence. In a double dream   
I must spell out the storm, the running stream.   
The beat’s too swift. The notes shift in the dark. 

Now that I have your voice by heart, I read. 

Now that I have your heart by heart, I see 
The wharves with their great ships and architraves;   
The rigging and the cargo and the slaves 
On a strange beach under a broken sky. 
O not departure, but a voyage done! 
The bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps 
Its red rust downward, and the long vine creeps   
Beside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun. 

Now that I have your heart by heart, I see.

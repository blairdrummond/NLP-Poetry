title : Vasectomy

author : Philip Appleman

text : 
After the steaming bodies swept 
through the hungry streets of swollen cities;   
after the vast pink spawning of family   
poisoned the rivers and ravaged the prairies;   
after the gamble of latex and 
diaphragms and pills; 
I invoked the white robes, gleaming blades   
ready for blood, and, feeling the scourge   
of Increase and Multiply, made 
affirmation: Yes, deliver us from 
complicity. 
And after the precision of scalpels, 
I woke to a landscape of sunshine where   
the catbird mates for life and 
maps trace out no alibis—stepped   
into a morning of naked truth, 
where acts mean what they really are:   
the purity of loving 
for the sake of love.

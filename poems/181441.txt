title : Perpetuum Mobile

author : Marin Sorescu

text : 
Between peopleâ€™s 
ideals 
and their realization 
there is always 
a greater drop 
than in the highest 
of waterfalls. 

This potential gradient 
can be exploited 
rationally, 
if we build a sort of 
power station above it. 

The energy it supplies, 
even if we use it only 
to light our cigarettes, 
is something 
anyway; 
for while one is smoking 
one can very seriously 
think up 
ideals even crazier.

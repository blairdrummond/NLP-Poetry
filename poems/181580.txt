title : Written with a Pencil Found in Lorine Niedecker’s Front Yard

Bewitched 
    the boys were out 
         in force 

Drunken- 
    ness and lust 

—and full moon 
bouncing back 
         and forth that 
black 

above the bars 

* 

Last night 
    it burned 
          cigarette 

tip 
    thru old 
         blanket 

hole-punched 
    gray paper 
         sky 

Tonight it 
    outright 
         blinded 

One headlight 
    or drive-in sci-fi 
          eye 

* 

I’ve been 
             alone 
long enough 

Even the moon 
wears a ring 

and is full

The Dead Kings 
Francis Ledwidge 
1887-1917

Ireland




All the dead kings came to me
 At Rosnaree, where I was dreaming,
 A few stars glimmered through the morn,
 And down the thorn the dews were streaming.
  
 And every dead king had a story
 Of ancient glory, sweetly told.
 It was too early for the lark,
 But the starry dark had tints of gold.
  
 I listened to the sorrows three
 Of that Eire passed into song.
 A cock crowed near a hazel croft,
 And up aloft dim larks winged strong.
  
 And I, too, told the kings a story
 Of later glory, her fourth sorrow:
 There was a sound like moving shields
 In high green fields and the lowland furrow.
  
 And one said: 'We who yet are kings
 Have heard these things lamenting inly.'
 Sweet music flowed from many a bill
 And on the hill the morn stood queenly.
  
 And one said: 'Over is the singing,
 And bell bough ringing, whence we come;
 With heavy hearts we'll tread the shadows,
 In honey meadows birds are dumb.'
  
 And one said: 'Since the poets perished
 And all they cherished in the way,
 Their thoughts unsung, like petal showers
 Inflame the hours of blue and grey.'
  
 And one said: 'A loud tramp of men
 We'll hear again at Rosnaree.'
 A bomb burst near me where I lay.
 I woke, 'twas day in Picardy.

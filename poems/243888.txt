1. Falmouth, Massachusetts, 1972
  
 Oak table, knotted legs, the chirp
 And scrape of tines to mouth.
 Four children, four engines
 Of want. That music.
  
 What did your hand mean to smooth
 Across the casket of your belly?
 What echoed there, if not me—tiny body
 Afloat, akimbo, awake or at rest?
  
 Every night you fed the others
 Bread leavened with the grains
 Of your own want. How
 Could you stand me near you,
  
 In you, jump and kick tricking
 The heart, when what you prayed for
 Was my father’s shadow, your name
 In his dangerous script, an envelope
  
 Smelling of gun-powder, bay rum,
 Someone to wrestle, sing to, question,
 Climb?
  
  
                         2. Interstate 101 South, California, 1981
  
 Remember the radio, the Coca-Cola sign
 Phosphorescent to the left, bridge
 After bridge, as though our lives were
 Engineered simply to go? And so we went
  
 Into those few quiet hours
 Alone together in the dark, my arm
 On the rest beside yours, our lights
 Pricking at fog, tugging us patiently
  
 Forward like a needle through gauze.
 Night held us like a house.
 Sometimes an old song
 Would fill the car like a ghost.
  
                                     3. Leroy, Alabama, 2005
  
 There’s still a pond behind your mother’s old house,
 Still a stable with horses, a tractor rusted and stuck
 Like a trophy in mud. And the red house you might
 Have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road.
  
 A girl from the next town over rides in to lend us
 Her colt, cries when one of us kicks it with spurs.
 Her father wants to buy her a trailer, let her try her luck
 In the shows. They stay for dinner under the tent
  
 Your brother put up for the Fourth. Firebugs flare
 And vanish. I am trying to let go of something.
 My heart cluttered with names that mean nothing.
 Our racket races out to the darkest part of the night.
  
 The woods catch it and send it back. 
  
  
                         4. But let’s say you’re alive again—
  
 Your hands are long and tell your age.
 You hold them there, twirling a bent straw,
 And my reflection watches, hollow-faced,
 Not trying to hide. The waiters make it seem
  
 Like Cairo. Back and forth shouting
 That sharp language. And for the first time
 I tell you everything. No shame
 In my secrets, shoddy as laundry.
  
 I have praised your God
 For the blessing of the body, snuck
 From pleasure to pleasure, lying for it, 
 Holding it like a coin or a key in my fist.
  
 I know now you’ve known all along.
  
 I won’t change. I want to give
 Everything away. To wander forever.
 Here is a pot of tea. Let’s share it
 Slowly, like sisters.

We buy what we cannot control, the rugs, 
   rhythm-makers, containing refrains of 
the oldest story: a man takes a journey. 
   I have no stories inside me, he says, 
so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet 
   of blue constellations, star patterns 
at the edges of disordered border walls. 
   At the center, a meditative medallion 
makes a moving immortal-flowered ground: 
   to live there is to give oneself over 
to greenness, redness, occasional blues, 
   holding those spirits of woollen dyes 
rising from the knots within to breathe 
   against the woven, multi-colored air. 


[BIDJAR] 

Now there is a coat of many colors hung 
   around the wanderer's shoulders where 
he climbs out from that pit, down which 
   he flung himself, or was thrown into. 
Reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds 
   the dusts of centuries residing there 
beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers 
   passing, wearing thin, fighting about 
how best to articulate the names of gods 
   for whom they yearn—accursed by wars' 
helmet curves, shields, chained stitches 
   of unmediated reds and yellowed husks 
of blood—broken lines marking a garden 
   in whose precincts his journey began. 


[KAZAK] 

Three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies 
   through golden latchhooks, surrounding 
cloudbanks; three eagles, darting within 
   their shifting images: they return him 
to streets of lit porches in summer dark, 
   a boy stuttering over random syllables, 
a blindfolded man pleading for his life— 
   whose fate is in the hands of some men 
whose fate is in the hands of other men, 
   whose fate . . . until the whole pattern 
emerges, and the language becomes clear. 
   On the floor lies his mother, moaning, 
until he comes out, guilty, before her— 
   amid the mud of his own frozen blood. 


[SHIRVAN] 

To live inside such squares as the weaver 
   of this green, becoming golden, labor; 
to pull back old skins and try to emerge, 
   victorious, from that old prison after 
so many years, is to find a path back to 
   harmonious designs, surely centered on 
the search—yet still speaking of a life 
   with knotted figures seen as suffering 
variations on themes that can be inferred 
   from small vibrations of weft and warp, 
the ‘snakes' within the threads worn down 
   to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms 
writhing in a loom of days: those humming 
   ancient instruments whose music seems 


[SHIRAZ] 

raw as colors governed by the earth, pink 
   as brick, or deserts scraped from rock, 
rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting 
   down the slopes of the central plateaus 
to fresh respites from thinner regions of 
   dessication fixed at the fringes below. 
These lands lie under the ache of desire, 
   which calls feet out to play upon sand, 
to fill each new hollow, and dance about, 
   tongues turning on the knots of umber, 
ochre, woven into those undulating waves 
   others might summon in flowery manners 
to escape from bitter orange, still held 
   by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple 


[KERMAN] 

empowering all those who try to hold on— 
   as all things will hold to themselves 
an idea of themselves—to an aspiration 
   towards good fortune, unwavering even 
unto death. Yet here are dusky passages, 
   canopies of clearness, an everlasting 
understanding of the earth as cancerous 
   points of coloration, acid starbursts, 
or dangerous blots—all blurring the way 
   to move past sight: perspectives lost 
and found again, symmetrical, surrounded 
   by the momentos one saves from travel, 
old friends, like hues that may betoken, 
   in hopefulness, some changes of heart. 


[SENNEH] 

This creates a powerful language about 
   how to levitate a plane—for even as 
the occasional murmurs of new machines 
   are heard in the land, as old cyclic 
gardens arrange themselves in the whorls 
   and tendrils throughout tilled fields, 
snakes hold up this world in variations 
   of light blue skies above temptation. 
Even when an illiterate weaver mistakes 
   an old date for the design, then dyes 
and binds strange numbers into a ground, 
   the change of the serif, for instance, 
in a calligraphy of days marks the date 
   of cartouches as mysterious, unknown. 


[KASHAN] 

Yet the signals from the borders suggest 
   a different tale: lozenges are bottles 
strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads, 
   shaped like a woman found lying along 
the side of those same roads—the figure 
   of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly 
back on itself—as a web of years frames 
   a dying kind of certitude, innocence. 
The birds in these cages signify singing, 
   as the tapestries of perfected threads 
suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries 
   to the indeterminancy of all creation:

and we can buy it yet, articulate or not, 
   with each new freeing of our hearts.

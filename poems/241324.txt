title : The Amaranth

is an imaginary flower that never fades.
 The amaranth is blue with black petals,
 it’s yellow with red petals,
 it’s enormous and grows into the shape
 of a girl’s house,
 the seeds nestle high in the closet
 where she hid a boy.
 The boy and his bike flee
 the girl’s parents from the tip
 of the leaves, green summer light
 behind the veins.
 The amaranth is an imaginary flower
 in the shape of a girl’s house
 dispensing gin and tonics
 from its thorns, a succulent.
 This makes the boy’s bike steer
 off-course all summer, following
 the girl in her marvelous car,
 the drunken bike.
  
 He was a small part of summer,
 he was summer’s tongue.

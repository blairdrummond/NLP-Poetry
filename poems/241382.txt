To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,
 I wrote a Cuban song about the need 
 For people to suppress their fantasies,
 Especially unhealthy ones. The song
 Began by making reference to the sea,
 Because the sea is like a need so great
 And deep it never can be swallowed. Then
 The song explores some common myths
 But the Cuban people and their folklore:
 The story of a little Carib boy
 Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;
 The legend of a bird who wanted song
 So desperately he gave up flight; a queen
 Whose strength was greater than a rival kingâ€™s.
 The song goes on about morality,
 And then there is a line about the sea,
 How deep it is, how many creatures need
 Its nourishment, how beautiful it is 
 To need. The song is ending now, because
 I cannot bear to hear it any longer.
 I call this song of needful love my voice.

title : Revelation at Cap Ferrat

text : 
It’s not solely the dance 
of the juggler but his spirit: 
with its turkey wings, perfect thighs, 
sensuous hips, large round flat eye. 
This eye smiles like lips. 
Watch this eye— 
it’s not a donkey eye. 

It’s not solely the dancer 
who moves like a circus animal 
as though to children’s music—no, 
it’s the girl in the swing’s rhythm, 
the ticking of the clock at night, 
the strut of the cock, the flight 
of the holy family to the remains. 
The nipple that feeds 
the infant is an eye looking 
into his future. 

It’s not even the village square 
with its musicians and happy faces 
that makes the difference—no, 
because if it were, weddings 
with violins, harps, flutes 
would have settled the question: 
no, it is the rising and lifting, 
the failing and catching of 
that unknown sense of self 
before it crashes, that matters.

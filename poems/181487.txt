Here we are 
in our doughboys and camos, our doughty frocks 
with drips of bitter on the sleeve, our passions revving 
their pulp to pittance at a gas station 
                                 in the city that never peeps—   

                                 and here is the city 
with its Martians in leather and excoriated thunderbolt- 
boas, its Bible-trippers, its vintage bazookas for barter 
not sale, its reluctance to be reluctant, its speed 
for hire, into which we atrophy ourselves to briefly fit—   

                                 and we are never 
so close to the joys of oil, the grease inside which a fat 
becomes a fit, as we bellow magnanimously praise 
on the least well of those who pass, ones who are dying 

we salute: we are coming from the war, they are going   
to the war—

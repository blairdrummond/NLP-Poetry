People expected that the evil would finally drain away. —Aleksander Wat, My Century
Faded and baked here to a tawny grit, 
spills of blood and seed from humanity 
called from it for its crimes against mute earth 
gully in footpaths, dribble down to the sea, 
payment now and forever drawn from birth 
through flesh’s sunny darkness. Light yeasts in it. 

And if I find the slope to crumbled temples 
of that light’s god dragging at me through heat, 
shallow degrees of slant up to remnant stone, 
then something more than burnt air, or the repeat 
of weight known as time, pulls heavily in this zone, 
something the bone brings, terrible through simple. 

Phoibos, slayer at distances with shock, 
sower of plague and arrower of healing, 
tension of bright-dark beyond spanning, love 
will not quite cast out evil while revealing 
your fissionables. The raven was your dove. 
Heavy isotopes hum with crickets in rock. 

Neither woman nor man, my driver laughed 
when his lights torched writhings down the far shoulder, 
cross-dresser in the night beyond Naples, huge, 
sinuous, crooning as we shot past. Life seems older 
in its variant forms, drawn by the centrifuge 
to the rim and swinging, swayed in time’s dream uncalfed. 

For the vast thrower, shafter of quivering force, 
sex was filigree in whoever served. 
Pythoness, yes, wombed keeper of those coils 
in the wet cellar where tongue darted and swerved. 
But her own throat when it swelled with voice knew toils 
past a man’s strength, torqued bulging from the source. 

And that young man fitted with bone and thong 
and membrane from his withers by his father 
the maze molder, when he climbed into flame 
itself in the high nucleus, dripped as slather 
down the sky’s maw. Union there, with an aim 
at the center, crisped on a central soundless gong, 

sizzling from his overreach extended 
back on itself and down, the soundless hurry 
of the sea far below minutely riven, 
trembling in place, diamonds in blue slurry 
nowhere disturbed yet flecking everywhere, driven— 
all this boy’s cry endlessly thin, suspended. 

The sybil when at last her throat disgorged 
its burdens rumbled like a pawing bull, 
or the bull-fiend on Krete, and shrilly warbled. 
Birds ride the bull’s hump in stone graphs, that full 
barbarity at poise piercing now the garbled 
clang of Ikaros, over us tensile and forged. 

This is the crumbling whistle of shells and frags 
in their close arc. Philosophy gets precise 
when it turns practical. This in our background whir. 
Archimedes, old Fermi in your eyes, 
naked, ecstatic with theorems that assure 
conclusion, your city falls, your hacked flesh sags. 

There was a sprig which, if you bore it in hand 
on landing here, your pilot drowned and your herald 
crushed in the surf, would bend and seem to listen— 
there was a branch that trailed her voice through imperiled 
corridors to throats of the dead, and glistened, 
then brought you back to your breath near shining sand. 

And there was pelt from the solar scavenger, 
its blond mane tossing with your workings, turning 
catastrophe to triumph, lion crud 
strewn now on waves, coat of the charger burning 
obsidian cobalt platinum and mud 
in craters of the shaker and avenger. 

Eroded skull of this squat promontory, 
nubbled shrine over cave by surf hypnotized 
before deeps enameled with fire’s mosaic, 
you are the structure lucid though pulverized 
behind the logics, and the omens prosaic 
in their spelling out, and the blaze of story. 

Give me your light! I am the darkened thing 
seeking it. Give me your fire and your cry! 
But hood me from sulfurs she inhaled when she twisted 
over the fissure, give me your hand from the sky 
we have fallen into. Give, yes, what you insisted 
she utter, rasped uncoilings of your spring! 

And then release me to the animal 
shy of speech yet steady in ecstasies, 
your cousin the outsider’s gaze through life, 
the drink of it down, and finally mind as frieze 
eternally in metamorphic strife 
released, sea stone and cloud infinitely small. 

And there the migrant and his wanderers 
may find the new land, and their future wars 
may roll, exhausted in hissing foam, to sink 
over the fish spines, and the blunderers 
of fulfillment stare at samsaric wink 
of ocean, stare and find sleep that dissolves the curse.

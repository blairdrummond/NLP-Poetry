title : Winter Journal: Threshed Blue, Cardings, Dim Tonsils

text : 
stripped batting of cloud 
glimpsed ligaments 
dusk coming up under 
lithographic, nib-hatchings 
       instruments click 
       the fine-sprung locust 
       replicate dinge along hill-lines 
       tailings of umber, the rust smudge 
There is still that hemmed ocean of oaks 
       the various reds, the somehow 
       silver cast over the brown-gold 
       the under-brushed shadows 
How can there be more of their dispensing 
       into air? 
The night-openings of the trees 
The thousand clefts into 
Their corridors shiver and merge and piece apart 
There is no one beside what was once river 
Only the carbons incoming 
       accreting in leaves 
Love of old oaks unencumbering 
Root-beauties brought through 
crude sieves of bare trees 
the few fastened leaves 
Those pods are like tongues or like sickles 
The blades have been pulled from their sheaths 
The backs of the clouds now upturned 
They herd from pink seas 
They make their untouchable stream 
       through regions of steep emptiness 
       against which the trees have their gestures 
Drop down, drop down toward me 
your little sleek scars 
Make your bed in rough cedars 
clangor of darks numbering in 
clusters of trunks and spoked lungs 
the thistles that work at the gums

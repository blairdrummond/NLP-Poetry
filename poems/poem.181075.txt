"Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me" 
Dante Alighieri 
1265-1321

Italy
Love, Heartache & Loss



on the 9th of June 1290
Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me,
    Saying, 'I've come to stay with thee a while';
    And I perceived that she had ushered Bile
And Pain into my house for company.
Wherefore I said, 'Go forth - away with thee!'
    But like a Greek she answered, full of guile,
    And went on arguing in an easy style.
Then, looking, I saw Love come silently,
Habited in black raiment, smooth and new,
    Having a black hat set upon his hair;
And certainly the tears he shed were true.
    So that I asked, 'What ails thee, trifler?'
Answering, he said: 'A grief to be gone through;
    For our own lady's dying, brother dear.'

title : And Still It Comes

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
like a downhill brakes-burned freight train 
full of pig iron ingots, full of lead   
life-size statues of Richard Nixon, 
like an avalanche of smoke and black fog   
lashed by bent pins, the broken-off tips 
of switchblade knives, the dust of dried offal, 
remorseless, it comes, faster when you turn your back,   
faster when you turn to face it,   
like a fine rain, then colder showers,   
then downpour to razor sleet, then egg-size hail, 
fist-size, then jagged 
laser, shrapnel hail 
thudding and tearing like footsteps   
of drunk gods or fathers; it comes   
polite, loutish, assured, suave,   
breathing through its mouth   
(which is a hole eaten by a cave),   
it comes like an elephant annoyed,   
like a black mamba terrified, it slides   
down the valley, grease on grease,   
like fire eating birds’ nests, 
like fire melting the fuzz 
off a baby’s skull, still it comes: mute   
and gorging, never 
to cease, insatiable, gorging 
and mute.

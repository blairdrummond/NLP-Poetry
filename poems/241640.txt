title : Symphony No.3, in D Minor

author : Jonathan Williams

text : 
Thousands lavishing, thousands starving;        intrigues, war, flatteries, envyings,      hypocrisies, lying vanities, hollow amusements,         exhaustion, dissipation, death—and giddiness         and laughter, from the first scene to the last.        —Samuel Palmer, 1858 ﻿
I. Pan Awakes: Summer Marches In
  
  
                Pan’s 
                spring rain
                “drives his victims
                out to the animals
                with whom they become
                as one”—
  
                pain and paeans,
                hung in the mouth,
  
                to be sung
                
  
                II. What the Flowers in the Meadow Tell Me
  
  
                June 6, 1857, Thoreau in his Journal:
  
                A year is made up of a certain series
                and number of sensations and thoughts
                which have their language in nature…
  
                Now I am ice, now
                I am sorrel.
  
                
                Or, Clare, 1840, Epping Forest:
  
                I found the poems in the fields
                And only wrote them down
  
                and
  
                The book I love is everywhere
                And not in idle words
  
                John, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
                the syllables are able 
                to turn plantains into quatrains,
               tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
               form corollas in light clusters of tones…
  
                Sam Palmer hit it:
                “Milton, by one epithet
                draws an oak of the largest girth I ever saw,
                ‘Pine and monumental oak’:
                I have just been trying to draw a large one in 
                Lullingstone; but the poet’s tree is huger than
                any in the park.”
  
                Muse in a meadow, compose in
                a mind!
  
  
                III. What the Animals in the Forest Tell Me
  
  
                Harris’s Sparrow—
  
                103 species seen
                by the Georgia Ornithological Society
                in Rabun Gap,
  
                including Harris’s Sparrow, with its
                black crown, face, and bib encircling
                a pink bill
  
  
                It was, I think, the third sighting
                in Georgia, and I should have been there
                instead of reading Clare, listening to
                catbirds and worrying about
                Turdus migratorious that flew
                directly into the Volkswagen and
                bounced into a ditch
  
  
                Friend Robin, I cannot figure it, if I’d
                been going 40 you might be
                whistling in some grass.
  
                10 tepid people got 10 stale letters
                one day earlier, 
                I cannot be happy
                about that. 
  
  
                IV. What the Night Tells Me
  
  
                the dark drones on
                in the southern wheat fields
                and the hop flowers
                open before the sun’s
                beckoning
  
  
                the end
                is ripeness, the wind
                rises,
                and the dawn says
                yes
  
  
                YES! it says
                “yes”
  
  
  
                V. What the Morning Bells Tell Me
  
  
                Sounds, and sweet aires
                that give delight
                and hurt not—
  
                that, let
                Shakespeare’s
                delectation 
                bear us
  
  
  
                VI. What Love Tells Me
  
  
  
                Anton Bruckner counts the 877th leaf
                on a linden tree in the countryside near Wien
                and prays:
  
                Dear God, Sweet Jesus,
                Save Us, Save Us…
  
                the Light in the Grass,
                the Wind on the Hill,
  
                are in my head,
                the world cannot be heard
  
  
                Leaves obliterate
                my  heart,
  
                we touch each other
                far apart…
  
  
                Let us count 
                into 
                the Darkness

text : 
As I sit here in the quiet Summer night, 
Suddenly, from the distant road, there comes 
The grind and rush of an electric car. 
And, from still farther off, 
An engine puffs sharply, 
Followed by the drawn-out shunting scrape of a freight train.   
These are the sounds that men make 
In the long business of living. 
They will always make such sounds, 
Years after I am dead and cannot hear them. 

Sitting here in the Summer night, 
I think of my death. 
What will it be like for you then? 
You will see my chair 
With its bright chintz covering 
Standing in the afternoon sunshine, 
As now. 
You will see my narrow table 
At which I have written so many hours. 
My dogs will push their noses into your hand,   
And ask—ask— 
Clinging to you with puzzled eyes. 

The old house will still be here, 
The old house which has known me since the beginning.   
The walls which have watched me while I played:   
Soldiers, marbles, paper-dolls, 
Which have protected me and my books. 
The front-door will gaze down among the old trees   
Where, as a child, I hunted ghosts and Indians;   
It will look out on the wide gravel sweep 
Where I rolled my hoop, 
And at the rhododendron bushes 
Where I caught black-spotted butterflies. 

The old house will guard you, 
As I have done. 
Its walls and rooms will hold you, 
And I shall whisper my thoughts and fancies   
As always, 
From the pages of my books. 

You will sit here, some quiet Summer night,   
Listening to the puffing trains, 
But you will not be lonely, 
For these things are a part of me. 
And my love will go on speaking to you 
Through the chairs, and the tables, and the pictures,   
As it does now through my voice, 
And the quick, necessary touch of my hand.

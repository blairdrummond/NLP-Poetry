title : The Gulf of Blues

On the other end of the line
 he sounds like my brother
 but is my father
 telling me about Coony who is fat.
 His whole body like a stomach
 round all round, fat even on his head.
 Eighty and heavy.
 How he joked Coony about his weight,
 joking him about a tow truck he’d need
 to haul him out of the tub
 like an old sunken ship pulled out of
 the gulf of blues,
 leaving whirlpools in the porcelain.
  
 “Quit all that eating and drinking,”
 my daddy say he said to him.
 “Quit pointing in that garden and reach down
 to get it.” My daddy say he joked him,
 ribbed him good.
 (And I know my daddy laughed gap-toothed,
 his mouth, throat, chest, and gut wide
 open for the signifying jest.
 His gray hair striking back time.)
  
 He sounds like my brother when he was
 a little boy, digging in the encyclopedia
 for the cause of something obscure, occult,
 trying to figure out how old Coony slipped
 in the bathtub that was always there
 and died like that. Baby Sister called
 to tell it first and she wasn’t joking
 after all like my daddy thought she was,
 Death a sad trick children pull.
  
 On the other end of the line
 my father sounds like my brother now.
 I know how
 Dying, bitter or tender, is the dark water that keeps
 us young.
 And this gulf of blues, deep and shiny,
 the only place to be
 between Time and Eternity.

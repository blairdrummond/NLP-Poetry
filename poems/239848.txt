grown to give this gun
to you that sings
around another metal grip
inside the stall that goes
against the marker that has cuts
and calculates their known
deception, something ran
instead around the parked
encircles disks. wagon, tent
was all that heard, no mouths
were twice together found
or borrowed in the ceiling of
another torso promising this
twice together head, this push
through veins that gives your
death another word, another
his, another whipping rain
with any arm and any end

finished — pocketed amount
that goes around the dust
inside their word, their forest
cut like wounded deer in sights
they have you down around
the bear that stole and bit
no wash, no jail in beaming what
had nothing in this earth
to speak the level of their tongue
that is all know, and all the S
that Panamá has had in hand
with me, I dream you were
     my heart all sewn
     together by their was
     and is is known
     right now

title : The Desert of Empire

author : Mark Rudman

How easily our lives could have been easier if our 
fathers hadn't done in whoever stood in their way. 
Did progress demand they set factories belching smoke 
like volcanoes? You're right to be dumbfounded as to why 

you're forced to spend your time making up for 
your ancestors' mistakes, waste this beautiful day 
restoring ruined shrines and temples 
so that the gods might not abandon Rome for good. 

There could be a turn about: after they were rid of 
the Etruscans, a few farsighted countrymen 
had the savvy to steal their fine 
sarcophagi designs, along with the booty. 

Decadence is your legacy. I hold out hope 
for satires, epigrams, and odes, but heaping on 
the gore is not an answer, and our plays are weak 
echoes of the Greeks. 

If you want to have some say in the way things are, 
put yourself in the hands of a higher order. 
Have faith in faith. Bow down to the gods 
who oversee and underwrite and sponsor. 

There's nothing empirical left to this empire now. 
What would have been routine raids on small fry 
republics—from Vietnam to the Isle of Man— 
are beaten back, and the opposition, 

in ecstatic mockery, turn our spoils 
to souvenir necklaces and key chains. 
The ancient city, riven by civil strife, 
escaped destruction by fanatic Bosnia and Iraq 

with their demonic submarines, bombers, 
and other dangerous toys, by a hairsbreadth. 
Self-absorbed, promiscuous, 
we've brought these evils on ourselves 

like people who, anticipating the worst 
from a routine physical, forswear 
doctors until their symptoms call for 
drastic measures; as only after 

the condom-clogged, gaseous, 
syringe-rich, toxic river 
overflows and floods the litter-free, 
segregated streets of the capital 

will the Rivers Network organize 
a mass cleanup on Earth Day. 
The young, lured always by the glitter of cities, 
find nothing cooler than the hotter— 

than-ever-before dance-crazes flown in 
from the clubs of Rio, Barcelona, or Berlin. 
How was a girl to know that marriage sucks 
the sap out of sex? And why not make it 

with the guests, especially if it's just the boost 
his mercurial career needs to rocket off... 
How are they to know the sexual spectacles 
began on their own ravaged ground? 

And these out-of-towners are so endlessly grateful 
for a dose of decadence because they 
"sure don't get pussy like this in Topeka." 
(The New Age victor is the one who gets 

the onlooker to come without anything 
physical happening between them.) 
"How does he think I know how to get the dry- 
cleaning-mogul's cock to stiffen, as if a good 

dis weren't hard to find, like 'you use your tongue 
like you're trying to remove a spot.'" 
Her husband, in his white tux, appeared 
nonchalant, but a second glance revealed 

a man slaphappy and dazed from one 
too many Zombies; either way, 
when the Titania II pulls into port 
she'll allow whoever has the best 

offer, captain or mutineer, Delano or 
Benito Cereno, to take her on the dance floor. 
Dalliance supplies what she needs for her shopping sprees 
which "this guy whose wedding ring I like never 

take off can't get through his head are 
necessary. He's so dense, like I show up 
in this designer dress on my 'allowance.' 
Men have no idea what it costs a girl to be 

truly glamorous in times like these— 
and when they land the commission 
remain clueless as to why they 
were chosen and not the other guy 

with the goody-two-shoes type wife." 
It's shattering to consider that these nerds, 
for whom watching's the real 
turn on, sprang from fierce, sturdy stock 

who in their youth conquered conquerors, 
brought down swaggering, gallant 
Hannibal, Pyrrhus, and Antiochus, 
dyeing the sea red with Punic blood. 

But the early Romans, the soldier-farmers, 
knew better than to double think what had to be done, 
and dug with the tools of the long-gone Sabines, 
and never neglected to cut the logs to honor 

mom's firm yet anxious request for firewood as 
shadows shifted on a far rise, night 
fell, and man and oxen were the same 
in their deep desire to lie down. 

Who is immune from ruin by time? 
Each generation wearier than the one before; 
these days no one deigns to have children 
until they are "professionally secure." 

And the media waits long and long to warn 
the idealists born during the baby-boom 
that the future is also being sabotaged: 
undone by sluggish sperm; hardened wombs.

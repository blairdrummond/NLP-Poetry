title : The Delta Parade

Everything stops. 
A fat man on his way to Baltimore   
smokes for three hours in the club car. 
The porter slips out and calls his wife, 
he has one dime left and he’s almost   
yelling. Somewhere south of York,   
she thinks he said. The funeral   
procession leaves its lights on   
and out of this pure stubbornness   
its batteries go dead. 
The bank robber leans on his horn   
in desperation while his partner   
snaps the rubber bands around   
the money. A band, 
you can hear it up the river, 
first like the new heart of the child on 
your lap, then like an old moon   
pulsing below your nails, or something 
softly moving through your arms and   
throat. Here, 
press here, not just drums. 
A clown is throwing caramels   
at the porch rails, balloons 
are exploding or sailing up the river.   
The lucky trees, to be able   
to stand that close. If we talk   
too much, we’ll surely miss it. 

And at the still center 
of summer it starts; cowboys ride out out 
of another life, old cars get up 
from the dead and dance 
like cripples hired out for a tent meeting.   
Up and down the sidewalk, the town   
sucks in its breath like a girl 
taking short gasps just above her trumpet,   
or a fire engine’s horn, heaving 
like a drowned man or a heat wave slapping   
against the water tower, this afternoon   
just like a parade. The sore-footed   
ponies are loaded down with flags   
and the library float says 
“Immortal Shakespeare,” says it 
with carnations and the hides of roses,   
says it with a jester and a princess   
wearing wings. 

And she stutters, but no one cares   
or can hear her. Except for the man   
on the unicycle who tips his top hat   
to the crowd, who swears he will   
follow her anywhere, who follows   
the mayor and the city council, who   
follows the tap dancing class and the Future   
Farmers, the Lions Club and the Veterans   
of Foreign Wars; who clasps a carnation   
between his teeth and sways   
back and forth like 
a broken clock. 

And then things begin again, 
a car follows the man on the unicycle   
and suddenly it’s just another car,   
a pair of dice dangling 
from the rearview mirror, a woman   
giving her breast to a child and another   
child carefully peeling a crayon, then   
slowly giving the peels to his 
grandmother, who opens the big brass   
clasps of her pocketbook and lets   
the bright curls drop slowly 
to the bottom 
like confetti or a boy’s first 
haircut. Like a first yellow leaf 
that fell when we weren’t looking. 
Because it’s summer. Like a smooth   
yellow pebble that is rubbing and rubbing   
in the new left boot of the drummer,   
that someone skimmed on the river   
exactly at three o’clock. 
Not out of anger or of boredom 
this time, but as if it could almost   
wear wings.

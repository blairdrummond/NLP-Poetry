Brilliance is a carcass 
on a snow-white beach. 

Envy never sleeps. 
I tell my children truthfully: 

a long red beard is breaking 
from the darkness scale. 

He’s chasing you because 
you’re new. Because he’s old 

and sees the town in dirty tones: 
violet sheep and wine-dark 

corn. He burns the evening 
rainbow like a wartime bridge 

until it’s charred and charlatans 
topple out of  robin eggs 

and pox  your happy window 
by capturing the ledge 

and chattering like X-rays 
that crash into your flesh.

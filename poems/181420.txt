title : Cinderblock

On the first warm day, 
the aides fret about his pate, 
fetch his hat. I push him 
out the automatic doors 
into the pallid sun. 
Dad thinks we should 
stay put until all the Indians 
are back in their tepees, 
but right now he’s off to teach 
a Latin class. Where are his keys? 
They’re a few miles away, 
in the past, where he’s no longer 
active in the community. 
I steer him along the asphalt paths 
of the grounds: bark mulch, 
first green shoots, 
puddle of coffee by a car. 
I loop around so he can discover 
the pile of construction materials twice, 
the word cinderblock coming to him 
more quickly the second time.

I am a tornado child. 
         I come like a swirl of black and darken up your day; 
         I whip it all into my womb, lift you and your things, 
         carry you to where you've never been, and maybe, 
         if I feel good, I might bring you back, all warm and scared, 
         heart humming wild like a bird after early sudden flight. 

I am a tornado child. 
         I tremble at the elements. When thunder rolls my womb 
         trembles, remembering the tweak of contractions 
         that tightened to a wail when my mother pushed me out 
         into the black of a tornado night. 

I am a tornado child, 
         you can tell us from far, by the crazy of our hair; 
         couldn't tame it if we tried. Even now I tie a bandanna 
         to silence the din of anarchy in these coir-thick plaits. 

I am a tornado child 
         born in the whirl of clouds; the center crumbled, 
         then I came. My lovers know the blast of my chaotic giving; 
         they tremble at the whip of my supple thighs; 
         you cross me at your peril, I swallow light 
         when the warm of anger lashes me into a spin, 
         the pine trees bend to me swept in my gyrations. 

I am a tornado child. 
         When the spirit takes my head, I hurtle into the vacuum 
         of white sheets billowing and paint a swirl of color, 
         streaked with my many songs.

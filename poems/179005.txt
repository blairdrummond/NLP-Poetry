title : Kissing a Horse

author : Robert Wrigley

text : 
Of the two spoiled, barn-sour geldings 
we owned that year, it was Red— 
skittish and prone to explode 
even at fourteen years—who’d let me 
hold to my face his own: the massive labyrinthine 
caverns of the nostrils, the broad plain 
up the head to the eyes. He’d let me stroke 
his coarse chin whiskers and take 
his soft meaty underlip 
in my hands, press my man’s carnivorous 
kiss to his grass-nipping upper half of one, just 
so that I could smell 
the long way his breath had come from the rain 
and the sun, the lungs and the heart, 
from a world that meant no harm.

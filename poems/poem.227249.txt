Imagery, Pastoral


Water and windmills, greenness, Islets green;?
Willows whose Trunks beside the shadows stood
Of their own higher half, and willowy swamp:?
Farmhouses that at anchor seem'd?in the inland sky
The fog-transfixing Spires?
Water, wide water, greenness and green banks,
And water seen?

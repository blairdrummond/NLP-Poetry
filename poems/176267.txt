title : The Moment When Your Name is Pronounced

author : Forrest Gander

text : 
This high up, the face 
eroding; the red cedar slopes 
over. An accident chooses a stranger. 
Each rain unplugs roots 
which thin out like a hand.   
Above the river, heat 
lightning flicks silently 
and the sound holds, coiled in air.   
Some nights you are here   
dangling a Valpolicella bottle,   
staring down at the flat water 
that slides by with its mouth full of starlight. 
It is always quiet 
when we finish the wine.   
While you were a living man   
how many pictures were done   
of you. Serious as an angel,   
lacing up your boots. Ice   
blows into my fields.

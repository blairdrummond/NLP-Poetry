title : "Pacific Surfliner" Now Arriving San Diego

author : W. S. Di Piero

The Santa Fe Depot's Moorish architecture of displacement— 
squeaky kids trawl satchels through the shed, happy voices 
mystically far from home, the waiting room's fizzled, tiled light 
of life lived imperfectly between one where and another. 
Everybody's here. Cowboys, Mennonites, Tijuana illegals, 
Muslim cabbies at prayer on loading docks as dark clouds 
fuss above the southerly sun past its prime. 

Killing time, a life mostly miscues and hesitance, 
I want something to take me over so looked for you 
near the baggage claim's glide, who could have been   
anybody from everywhere, like Ellis Island's ghosts, 
their dump of cardboard valises, bindles, baby-fat sacks 
strangled by hemp, and around me here long-haul lovers who 
in sleepers last night loved to exhaustion. Scorched roughnecks, 
perfumed girls in heels grabbing Samsonites and golf bags 
schooling the carousel's louvered U-turns and straightaways. 

It must be why I'm here, to wait and see who claims 
what looks too much like your brown suede duffel, 
no "Antigua" or "Cancun" decaled in its hide, 
nasal music threading the scene while tonight you weave 
through songs somewhere else. That floppy bag and us— 
the Garment District, two Venices, South End, South Philly, 
scraped nap, brass clips, gaunt warmed handle. . . 
A teenage girl two-hands it off the belt and waddles 
into the runny sun, your bag five years late 
thumping freshened thighs and dimpled knees. 
Where are you now that you're here again for me? 
Hear these thrilled voices, 
                                       the engine horn howling? 
                                                                                 Smell these acid residues?

title : Sonnet #10

author : Hayden Carruth

text : 
You rose from our embrace and the small light spread 
like an aureole around you. The long parabola 
of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh I saw 
permute itself through unfolding and unlimited 
minuteness in the movement of your tall tread, 
the spine-root swaying, the Picasso-like Ã©clat 
of scissoring slender legs. I knew some law 
of Being was at work. At one time I had said 
that love bestows such values, and so it does, 
but the old man in his canto was right and wise: 
ubi amor ibi ocullus est. 
Always I wanted to give and in wanting was 
the poet. A man now, aging, I know the best 
of love is not to bestow, but to recognize.

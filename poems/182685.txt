title : For the Old Gnostics

author : Robert Bly

text : 
The Fathers put their trust in the end of the world 
And they were wrong.   The Gnostics were right and not 
Right.   Dragons copulate with their knobby tails. 
Some somnolent wealth rises unconcerned, 
Over there!   In the world!   Ponderous stubborn 
Sorrow weighs down the flying Gospels. 
Some enormous obstacle blocks our way. 
The untempered soul grumbles in empty light.

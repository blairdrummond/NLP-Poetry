title : Escape from the Old Country

author : Adrienne Su

text : 
I never had to make one,
 no sickening weeks by ocean,
  
 no waiting for the aerogrammes
 that gradually ceased to come.
  
 Spent the babysitting money
 on novels, shoes, and movies,
  
 yet the neighborhood stayed empty.
 It had nothing to do with a journey
  
 not undertaken, not with dialect,
 nor with a land that waited
  
 to be rediscovered, then rejected.
 As acid rain collected
  
 above the suburban hills, I tried
 to imagine being nothing, tried
  
 to be able to claim, “I have
 no culture,” and be believed.
  
 Yet the land occupies the person
 even as the semblance of freedom
  
 invites a kind of recklessness.
 Tradition, unobserved, unasked,
  
 hangs on tight; ancestors roam
 into reverie, interfering at the most
  
 awkward moments, first flirtations,
 in doorways and dressing rooms—
  
 But of course. Here in America,
 no one escapes. In the end, each traveler
  
 returns to the town where, everyone
 knew, she hadn’t even been born.

To Proverbs
As Love and I, late harbour'd in one inn, 
With proverbs thus each other entertain: 
In love there is no lack, thus I begin, 
Fair words make fools, replieth he again; 
Who spares to speak, doth spare to speed (quoth I), 
As well (saith he) too forward, as too slow; 
Fortune assists the boldest, I reply, 
A hasty man (quoth he) ne'er wanted woe; 
Labour is light, where love (quoth I) doth pay, 
(Saith he) light burthen's heavy, if far born; 
(Quoth I) the main lost, cast the bye away; 
You have spun a fair thread, he replies in scorn. 
    And having thus awhile each other thwarted, 
    Fools as we met, so fools again we parted.

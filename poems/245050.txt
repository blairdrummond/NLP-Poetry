title : The Thing about Joe Sullivan

author : Roy Fisher

text : 
The pianist Joe Sullivan,
 jamming sound against idea
  
 hard as it can go
 florid and dangerous
  
 slams at the beat, or hovers,
 drumming, along its spikes;
  
 in his time almost the only
 one of them to ignore
  
 the chance of easing down,
 walking it leisurely,
  
 he’ll strut, with gambling shapes,
 underpinning by James P.,
  
 amble, and stride over
 gulfs of his own leaving, perilously
  
 toppling octaves down to where
 the chords grow fat again
  
 and ride hard-edged, most lucidly
 voiced, and in good inversions even when
  
 the piano seems at risk of being
 hammered the next second into scrap.
  
 For all that, he won’t swing
 like all the others;
  
 disregards mere continuity,
 the snakecharming business,
  
 the ‘masturbator’s rhythm’
 under the long variations:
  
 Sullivan can gut a sequence
 in one chorus—
  
 —approach, development, climax, discard—
 and sound magnanimous.
  
 The mannerism of intensity
 often with him seems true,
  
 too much to be said, the mood
 pressing in right at the start, then
  
 running among stock forms
 that could play themselves
  
 and moving there with such
 quickness of intellect
  
 that shapes flaw and fuse,
 altering without much sign,
  
 concentration
 so wrapped up in thoroughness
  
 it can sound bluff, bustling,
 just big-handed stuff—
  
 belied by what drives him in
 to make rigid, display,
  
 shout and abscond, rather
 than just let it come, let it go—
  
 And that thing is his mood:
 a feeling violent and ordinary
  
 that runs in among standard forms so
 wrapped up in clarity
  
 that fingers following his
 through figures that sound obvious
  
 find corners everywhere,
 marks of invention, wakefulness;
  
 the rapid and perverse
 tracks that ordinary feelings
  
 make when they get driven
 hard enough against time.

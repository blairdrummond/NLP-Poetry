title : Fragment of a Women from Kos

author : Susan Mitchell

text : 
At first all you see are the folds 
of drapery, high grass close together, swaying 
beads you parted as a child, field behind 
the house, then river. Sky. 
You were told finches lived there, red- 
winged, tipsy, upside down their hold 
on the reeds, even so 
they sang, trilling over and over 
your outstretched hands song 
poured like seeds from a basket or from 
a bowl, water. 
                   There was a woman, 
young, beautiful—you used to hug her 
from behind, closing your hands 
over the cry of surprise 
she gave out 
like perfume. Now here 
she is, rising 
from the dead 
landscape of memory, just this 
fragment of her, still   
kneeling.

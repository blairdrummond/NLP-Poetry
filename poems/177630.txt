title : Twenty-third

text : 
And at the picnic table under the ancient elms, 
one of my parents turned to me and said: 
“We hope you end up here,”
where the shade relieves the light, where we sit  
in some beneficence—and I felt the shape of the finite  
after my ether life: the ratio, in all dappling, 
of dark to bright; and yet how brief my stay would be 
under the trees, because the voice I’d heard 
could not cradle me, could no longer keep me 
in greenery; and I would have to say good-bye 
again, make my way across the white 
California sand and back: or am I now creating 
the helplessness I heard those words express, 
the psalm torn like a map in my hands?

Fetch? Balls and sticks capture my attention 
seconds at a time. Catch? I don’t think so. 
Bunny, tumbling leaf, a squirrel who’s—oh 
joy—actually scared. Sniff the wind, then 

I’m off again: muck, pond, ditch, residue 
of any thrillingly dead thing. And you? 
Either you’re sunk in the past, half our walk, 
thinking of what you never can bring back, 

or else you’re off in some fog concerning 
—tomorrow, is that what you call it? My work: 
to unsnare time’s warp (and woof!), retrieving, 
my haze-headed friend, you. This shining bark, 

a Zen master’s bronzy gong, calls you here, 
entirely, now: bow-wow, bow-wow, bow-wow.

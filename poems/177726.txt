For Max Rojas
Once a month 
when the moon loses everything, 
Don Max takes a chair 
to the edge of the sea. 
Black sand beach & green-backed heron. 
The moon   
casts off her milkglass earrings. 
I am nothing, she says, but black & white. 
I keep losing my face. 
Don Max feels for his pipe in his pocket. 
Takes it, knocks it against his palm. 
I am old! She cries. I get gooseflesh 
in the dark. Don Max is looking for his tobacco. 
Don Max has found a match. 
You don’t know how hard it is 
to come back from nothing.   
Don Max smiles & lights up.   
I keep making the same mistakes, she says. 
I think you should leave me, she says.   
Through smoke, she watches Don Max 
fold a strip of seaweed into a grasshopper. 
Leave me for your own good! She demands. 
Don Max has set the grasshopper in the sand. 
Besides, I am too beautiful.   
She speaks it as though it makes her sad. 
I’ll find other lovers. I will 
forget you.

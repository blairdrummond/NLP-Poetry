title : Slam, Dunk, & Hook

Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's 
Insignia on our sneakers, 
We outmaneuvered to footwork 
Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot 
Swish of strings like silk 
Ten feet out. In the roundhouse 
Labyrinth our bodies 
Created, we could almost 
Last forever, poised in midair 
Like storybook sea monsters. 
A high note hung there 
A long second. Off 
The rim. We'd corkscrew 
Up & dunk balls that exploded 
The skullcap of hope & good 
Intention. Lanky, all hands 
& feet...sprung rhythm. 
We were metaphysical when girls 
Cheered on the sidelines. 
Tangled up in a falling, 
Muscles were a bright motor 
Double-flashing to the metal hoop 
Nailed to our oak. 
When Sonny Boy's mama died 
He played nonstop all day, so hard 
Our backboard splintered. 
Glistening with sweat, 
We rolled the ball off 
Our fingertips. Trouble 
Was there slapping a blackjack 
Against an open palm. 
Dribble, drive to the inside, 
& glide like a sparrow hawk. 
Lay ups. Fast breaks. 
We had moves we didn't know 
We had. Our bodies spun 
On swivels of bone & faith, 
Through a lyric slipknot 
Of joy, & we knew we were 
Beautiful & dangerous.

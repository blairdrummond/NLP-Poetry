One of them             drops radio into hardhat 
                               and spits, Damn it, 
                               boys, we won’t need this one.   
But hell, they had already drilled 
the charge. In the dynamite’s   
wake, boulders turn to snow.   
Men walk through the trees. 
            It’s cool now in here.   
Quiet enough 
to hear tracks rust; 
the Monte Ne line that never whistled through 
and the summering passengers   
unstartled by sudden dark,   
the temperature drop. 
Stones jut out, 
gargoyles scabbed with lichen.   
The steamy eye 
of an afternoon 
watches us from either end. 
            We are waylaid by a spell. 
A stone 
slithers off 
or I imagine this. 
In the pitch I feel 
the others when they breathe.   
We are unborn. One 
of our silhouettes speaks, 
            There’s a camera in the car. 
Bats opening like orchids. 
The absence of one of us, unimaginable— 
our present so intense 
its tense is aorist. 
Each of us afraid to leave   
two men he loves behind.

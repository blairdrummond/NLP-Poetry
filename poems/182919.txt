title : Beautiful Signor

author : Cyrus Cassells

text : 
All dreams of the soul  End in a beautiful man’s or woman’s body.   —Yeats, “The Phases of the Moon”  
Whenever we wake, 
still joined, enraptured— 
at the window, 
each clear night’s finish 
the black pulse of dominoes 
dropping to land; 

whenever we embrace, 
haunted, upwelling, 
I know 
a reunion is taking place—      

Hear me when I say 
our love’s not meant to be 
an opiate; 
helpmate, 
you are the reachable mirror 
that dares me to risk 
the caravan back 
to the apogee, the longed-for 
arms of the Beloved— 


Dusks of paperwhites, 
dusks of jasmine, 
intimate beyond belief 

beautiful Signor 

no dread of nakedness 

beautiful Signor 

my long ship, 
my opulence, 
my garland 

beautiful Signor 

extinguishing the beggar’s tin, 
the wind of longing 

beautiful Signor 

laving the ruined country, 
the heart wedded to war 

beautiful Signor 

the kiln-blaze 
in my body, 
the turning heaven 

beautiful Signor 

you cover me with pollen 

beautiful Signor 

into your sweet mouth— 

This is the taproot: 
against all strictures, 
desecrations, 
I’ll never renounce, 
never relinquish 
the first radiance, the first 
moment you took my hand— 

This is the endless wanderlust: 
dervish, 
yours is the April-upon-April love 
that kept me spinning even beyond 
your eventful arms 
toward the unsurpassed: 

the one vast claiming heart, 
the glimmering, 
the beautiful and revealed Signor.

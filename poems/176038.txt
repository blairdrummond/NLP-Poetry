1. The Winter: 1748 
—Erasmus Darwin, 1731-1802 

A little satin like wind at the door. 
My mother slips past in great side hoops,   
arced like the ears of elephants 
on her head a goat-white wig, 
on her cheek a dollop of mole. 

She has entered the evening, and I 
her room with its hazel light. 
Where her wig had rested is a leather head,   
a stand, perfect in its shadow but 
carrying in fact, where the face should be,   
a swath of door. It cups 

in its skull-curved closure 
clay hair stays, a pouch of wig talc 
that snows at random and lends to the table 

a neck-shaped ring. 
When I reach inside I am frosted,   
my hand like a pond in winter, pale   
fingers below of leaves or carp. 

I have studied a painting from Holland,   
where a village adjourns to a frozen river. 
Skaters and sleighs, of course, but   
ale tents, the musk of chestnuts, 

someone thick on a chair with a lap robe.   
I do not know what becomes of them   
when the flow revisits. Or why 
they have moved from their warm hearthstones   
to settle there—except that one step 

is a method of gliding, 
the self for those moments 
weightless and preened as my leather companion. 
And I do not know if the fish there   
have frozen, or wait in some stasis 
like flowers. Perhaps they are stunned 
by the strange heaven—dotted with 

boot soles and chair legs 
and are slumped on the mud-rich bottom— 
waiting through time for a kind of shimmer,   
an image perhaps, something 
known and familiar, something   

rushing above in their own likeness, 
silver and blade-thin at the rim of the world. 


2. The Lions: North Staffordshire, 1770   
—James Whitfield, 1735-1772 
 

There are backflows of broom and mayweed, 
coal rillets 
slick on the mine path. 
And the bulrush reeds stretch up from the marsh pond   
like the stiffened tails of lions. 

I walk toward a village of perfect exchange: 
my life taking coal from the earth, then the potter   
in turn taking heat from the coal, the earth   
giving up an arc shape of pot, and the pot   
giving back, in some fired brilliance,   
a raspberry vine. . . . 

We make from the spines of bulrush reeds   
our tallow candles, each turn 
in a trough of sheep fat 
increasing their marble. They burn with a kind   
of spitting and cast to the walls 
an equal division of soot and light, 

all the surfaces gradually blackening,   
around the crucifix, the pastel sketch of   
a peach and char. 

Through the windows, 
great kilns cast the shadows of scent jars. 

It is a kind of immortality for us, that   
entering, that coming away, icicles thick 
in the drift tunnels, our lungs half functioning, 
but functioning—each chest with its hissing 
like a room with a brook running under it. 

When the earth shudders just over our heads, 
we say that the lions are walking, 
down from the marsh pond, out through 
the seams. We die with their chests 
pressed over our chests. In feast position. 
In rubble or in bed. 

The lions are with us, we say to our children, 
although nothing is there but 
the bedclothes. They have come for their tails, 

that sputter and flare on the bedposts 
and mark with their compass-point brilliance 
the absolute boundaries of 
any world opening under us. 


3. Wedgwood: 1790 
—Josiah Wedgwood, 1730-1795 

When smallpox settles like sand at the knee   
each upstep is a rasp, each kneeling 
the hiss, then downwash of seedpods. 
Just a boy, I limped past a pity 
of cantering geese, black-beaked with madness, 

each with its burden of drunken rider, 
then crossed the short tracks of moorland waste,   
the gorse tufts, the low-slung canopies of broom.   
Near the treeline, a single deer stepped 
into a stillness, watched me from a stillness, 
a magical closure of particles, light. Behind me, 

the pot banks of Burslem shivered like hives. 

I grew, declined. My cane tip 
a hail on the cobbles. And each day, 
each year, from a salt glaze or green glaze: 
knife-hafts, pickle-leaves, then creamers, Queen's ware,   
the press of the moulder's board, the dip 
of the baller's scale. I visited the chemists. 
I visited the soil. 

One spring, they severed my leg with a surgeon's blade. 

And up through the rice grains of laudanum,   
through the stupor, dream, as the blade   
wheezed with the breath-strokes of sleepers,   
I watched the still globe of our earth 
shatter and rush, burst away in an instant— 
particles, light. Then a cough. The thin 

lispings of thread under skin. 
On a wooden limb—brindled and cold as a pike— 
I walked and re-walked the kiln-room floors, 
saw on the rackworks those jasper bodies, cawk-white 
and luminous. And where was I going those years 
of my life, pigments of gorse and heath 
flaring, fading on the hillsides?   

In the royal chambers one morning, I watched 
as the Queen, from an elbow pad of claret velvet,   
reached up with her forearm and open hand 
to the open hand of the glove maker. From her 
nails and knuckles to her palm, wrist, 
he stroked out a cover of suckling fawn, translucent, 

fragile as the inner skin of eggs. 
Then a flush rose in the rims of her ears,   
as if she imagined an alternate world, as if 
through that dappled membrane, she were held 
by an alternate world—suspended—like water 
by a vase still rich with the coal-scent of fire. 
And as long as she did not move at all, 
there she would stay.

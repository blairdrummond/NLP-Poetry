And how terrific it is to write a radio poem 
and how terrific it is to stand on the roof and 
watch the stars go by and how terrific it is to be 
misled inside a hallway, and how terrific it is 
to be the hallway as it stands inside the house, 
and how terrific it is, shaped like a telephone, 
to be filled with scotch and stand out on the street, 
and how terrific it is to see the stars inside the radios 
and cows, and how terrific the cows are, crossing 
at night, in their unjaundiced way and moving 
through the moonlight, and how terrific the night is, 
purveyor of the bells and distant planets, and how 
terrific it is to write this poem as I sleep, to sleep 
in distant planets in my mind and cross at night the 
cows in hallways riding stars to radios at night, and 
how terrific night you are, across the bridges, into 
tunnels, into bars, and how terrific it is that you are 
this too, the fields of planetary pull, terrific, living 
on the Hudson, inside the months of spring, an 
underwater crossing for the cows in dreams, terrific, 
like the radios, the songs, the poem and the stars.

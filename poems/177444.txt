title : The Homecoming

author : Barbara Howes

text : 
All the great voyagers return 
Homeward as on an arc of thought;   
Home like a ruby beacon burns 
As they crest wind, scale wave, soar air;   
All the great voyagers return, 

Though we who wait never have done   
Fearing the piteous accidents, 
The coral reef sharp as the bones   
It has betrayed, fate’s cormorant   
Unleashed, whose diving’s never done. 

Even the voyager of mind 
May fail beneath behemoth’s weight;   
Oh, the world’s bawdy carcass blinds   
All but the boldest, rots the sails 
And swamps the voyaging of the mind. 

But all the great voyagers return 
Home like the hunter, like the hare 
To its burrow; below, earth’s axle turns 
To speed their coming, the following fair 
Winds bless their voyage, blow their safe return.

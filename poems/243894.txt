What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee;   What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage.                  Ezra Pound
You’ll find labels describing what is gone:
 an empress’s bones, a stolen painting
  
 of a man in a feathered helmet
 holding a flag-draped spear.
  
 A vellum gospel, hidden somewhere long ago
 forgotten, would have sat on that pedestal;
  
 this glass cabinet could have kept the first
 salts carried back from the Levant.
  
 To help us comprehend the magnitude
 of absence, huge rooms
  
 lie empty of their wonders—the Colossus,
 Babylon’s Hanging Gardens and
  
 in this gallery, empty shelves enough to hold
 all the scrolls of Alexandria.
  
 My love, I’ve petitioned the curator
 who has acquired an empty chest
  
 representing all the poems you will
 now never write. It will be kept with others
  
 in the poet’s gallery. Next door,
 a vacant room echoes with the spill
  
 of jewels buried by a pirate who died
 before disclosing their whereabouts.
  
 I hope you don’t mind, but I have kept
 a few of your pieces
  
 for my private collection. I think
 you know the ones I mean.

title : A Parking Lot in West Houston

Angels are unthinkable
 in hot weather
  
 except in some tropical locales, where
 from time to time, the women catch one in their nets,
  
 hang it dry, and fashion it into a lantern
 that will burn forever on its own inexhaustible oils.
  
 But here—shins smocked with heat rash,
 the supersaturated air. We no longer believe
  
 in energies pure enough not to carry heat,
 nor in connections—the thought of someone
  
 somewhere warming the air we breathe
 that one degree more . . . .
  
 In a packed pub during the World Cup final,
 a bony redhead woman gripped my arm
  
 too hard. I could see how a bloke might fancy you.
 Like a child’s perfect outline in fast-melting snow,
  
 her wet handprint on my skin, disappearing.
 The crowd boiling over, a steam jet: Brrra-zil!
  
 And Paris—a heroin addict
 who put her hypodermic
  
 to my throat: Je suis malade.
 J’ai besoin de medicaments.
  
 Grabbing her wrist, I saw
 her forearm’s tight net sleeve of drying blood.
  
 I don’t like to be touched. 
 I stand in this mammoth parking lot,
  
 car doors open, letting the air conditioner
 run for a while before getting in.
  
 The heat presses down equally
 everywhere. It wants to focus itself,
  
 to vaporize something instantaneously,
 efficiently—that shopping cart, maybe,
  
 or that half-crushed brown-glass bottle—
 but can’t quite. Asphalt softens in the sun.
  
 Nothing’s detachable.
 The silvery zigzag line
  
 stitching the tarmac to the sky around the edges
 is no breeze, just a trick of heat.
  
 My splayed-out compact car half-sunk
 in the tar pit of its own shadow—
  
 strong-shouldered, straining
 to lift its vestigial wings.

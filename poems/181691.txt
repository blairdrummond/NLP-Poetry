“Who are you to tell us how to live or why, 
et cetera?”   No Man, of course, and not so tall   
as is the current fashion, nor smart enough 
in the acceptable modern way, to enthrall 

the crowd with stories of my life among 
the savages where I was home and growing 
baffled day by day, raging through the night 
as if it were new music I made, groaing. 

It came to me today at lunch, the sound 
of women in the next booth, a voice like 
Aunt Odile’s—whom I never knew well 
nor did I like her, but not her spite 

but her voice like home-grown fame, a touch 
gravelly, a considerable groan itself, it seemed. 
They spoke outmoded French around me, never 
to me, except to taunt, I thought.   She leaned 

above me, on those visits, speaking to Mother 
in their private French, laughing.   A boy 
surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues 
knowing what wasn’t meant for him:   toy 

temptations, suggestive coils of syllables. 
I learned Latin, for Mass, and did love 
its terrific laddered randomness:   
The Blessed hovering Virgin above 

every station of a boy’s new path, hormonal 
disharmonies, her praises sung into hundreds 
the first Tuesday of every month: and yet 
Latin could not expose such shreds 

of glittering flesh as I found in French, 
not like the living tongue whose tip twined 
into an Uncle’s mustache as he leered 
at the wrong Aunt and winked and a fine 

distance crystallized loud there, then 
gone. Crashing like German. Father’s family 
spoke clear English among the bayous, boys 
and girls of immigrants accentless happily 

German through two wars, not counting 
Civil.   I had the tongue for arithmetic 
and spoke it beautifully.   I loved to count:   
precision’s a tempting career, clicking 

into a future like an abacus ignoring 
all those accents around. 
I never learned the luck of any 
but English, bland and bound. 

But only yesterday I heard a word 
the mechanic said in Czech 
to his cousin—shop rag—clearly centered 
in a welter of incomprehension, the wreck 

of my car at their wretched mercies:   shop 
rag.   And he wiped his hands and cried   
for me, shrugging like a cousin would. 
I wrote a check. I drove home, or tried. 

So does it count?   Am I a man of passion or 
child of comprehension?   “Father of little lusts 
driving myself home who thinks:   Buy some 
sentiment, a little like love and she must 

speak French this time. She longs 
for you, you know; it isn’t just the money. 
America loves you for yourself alone” 
and so I go for professional help, honey- 

blond hair and a disposition like 
a happy banker, whose French for dear 
sounds like dog; the cost of living 
is going up, loving her here.

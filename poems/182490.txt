text : 
The threewomen who all walked 
In the same dress 
And it had falling ferns on it 
Skipped parallel   
To the progress 
Of Giovanni Franchi 

Giovanni Franchi’s wrists flicked 
Flickeringly as he flacked them 
His wrists explained things 
Infectiously by way of his adolescence 
His adolescence was all there was of him 
Whatever was left was rather awkward 
His adolescence tuned to the tops of trees 
Descended to the fallacious nobility 
Of his first pair of trousers 

They were tubular      flapped friezily 
The color of coppered mustard 
What matter 
Were they not the first 
No others could ever be the first again 
The ferns on the flounces of the threewomen 
Began fading as she thought of it 
Tea table problems for insane asylyms 
Are démodé 
Démodé 

Allow us to rely on our instincts 
The threewomen was composed of three instincts 
Each sniffing divergently directed draughts 
The first instinct    first again    (may 
Renascent gods save us from the enigmatic 
Penetralia of Firstness) 
Was to be faithful to a man       first 
The second       to be loyal to herself first 
She would have to find which self first 
The third which might as well have been first 
Was to find out how many toes the   
Philosopher Giovanni Bapini had       first 

Giovanni Franchi hooligan-faced and latin-born 
You imagine what he looked like 
Looked as nearly as he could as the   
Philosopher looked 
His articulations were excellent 
Still    where Giovanni Bapini was cymophanous 
Giovanni Franchi was merely pale 

He scuttled winsomely 
To its distribution from a puffer   
For the declaration of War 
His acolytian sincerity 
The sensitive down among his freckles 
Fell in with the patriotic souls of flags 
Red white and green flags      fillipping piazzas 
When the “National Idea” arrived on the Milan Express 

Continually cutting off an angle from Paschkowski’s 
Through plate-glass swingings 
To look as busy bodily 
As the philosopher’s brain was 
As Giovanni Bapini importuned mobs 
From monumental gums 
To the sparky detritus 
From the hurried cigarette 
Of his disciple 
Whose papa and mama kept a trattoria 
Audaciously squatting right opposite the Pitti Palace 
The Pitti Palace however stolid      could hardly help noticing 
Being an aristocrat it went on looking 
As plainly piled up as ever 
The Pitti Palace has never been known to mention the trattoria 
Or mention Giovanni Franchi 
Sitting in it 
At a book 
It could not see from that distance 
Giovanni watching the munchers supporting his parents   
With an eye 
On assuring himself 
Of their sufficient impression 
By erudition 

He was so young 
That explains so much 
No book ever explained what to be young is 
But they look so much more important for that 
Giovanni was in continuous ecstacy 
Induced by the imposing look of them 
When Giovanni Bapini spoke of them 
He could not tell 
How completely more precious 
Would be such knowledge 
As how many toes the philosopher Giovanni Bapini had 

Now the threewomen 
For pity’s sake 
Let us think of her as she    to save time 
Seeing the minor Giovanni 
Sitting at the major Giovanni’s feet 
Made sure he must be counting his toes 
All to the contrary    he was picking the philosopher’s brains 
Happy in the security that when he had done 
He would still be youthful enough to sort out his own 

He listened at the elder’s lips 
That taught him of earthquakes and 
Of women— 
His manners were abominable 
He would kill a woman 
Quite inconspicuously it is true 
And neglect to attend her funeral 
I mean the older man 
And what he told 
Giovanni Franchi 
About these pernicious persons 
Was so extremely good for him 
It entirely spoilt his first love-affair 
To such an extent          it never came off 

We have read of   
Trattoria    meaning eating house. 
Piazzas    or squares 
The Pitti Palace    enormous 
And Paschkowski’s      for beer 
All are in Firenze 
Firenze is Florence 
Some think it is a woman with flowers in her hair 
But NO       it is a city with stones on the streets 

Giovanni Bapini often said 
Everybody in Firenze knows me 
And everybody did 
Excepting—That is      she didn’t 
She never knew what he was 
Or how he was himself 
Yet she uniquely was the one 
To speculate      upon the number of his toes 
The days growing longer 
Fulfilling her of curiousity 

She made a moth’s net 
Of metaphor and miracles 
And on the incandescent breath of civilizations 
She chased by moon-and-morn light 
Philosopher’s toes 

As virginal      as had he never worn them 
Clear of ‘white marks means money’ 
All quicks and cores 
They fluttered to her fantasy 
Fell into her lap 
While she gathered her ferny flounces about them 
They inappropriately passed 

But Giovanni Franchi was there 
He almost winked it at her 
That he was there 
His eyes were intrepid with phantom secrets 
The Philosopher had flung to him 
And as she tripped by him 
She guessed      these all 
All    but the number of those toes 

She made diurnal pilgrimage 
To the trattoria 
To eat 
Trout    that might have been trained for circuses 
If minarets    grew in miniature whirlpools 
And mayonnaise       that helped her to forget 
That what is underneath       need never matter 

She put all minor riddles out of her 
Such as 
What was the under-cover of Franchi’s book 
Telling to the plaid pattern of the tablecloth 
Too shy to interrogate 
She sent ambassadors 
To the disciple 
They returned 
Oh rats 
Quite manifest    that Giovanni Franchi 
Some semieffigy 
Damned by scholiums 
Knew no more      how many toes— 
Than      Giovanni Bapini knew himself

title : A Day At The Races

When you wake up after twelve hours 
The stove is cold, there's ice in the water bucket 
— clouds outside and snow, the noise of a crow, 
The only sound; until your wife cries 
From an upper bunk, Honey, I'd like some coffee. 
Luther chuckles. I nod, excuse myself  for the men's room 

Next to me stretches a teacher 
Who once warned me not to get married 
Too early. Elderly now, but having done well 
In real estate as a second career. He says 
Well, well, as if  he can't recall my name. 
But buys me a drink and talks of  his wayward 
Daughter. When he mentions her married last name 
I tell him I have met her, but leave off at that    . . . 
He squints like a badger. In my wife's family, he resumes, 
After a jostling by a drunken salesman, there's a 
Sort of stupid gene that runs through the whole outfit, 
Being half  Finnish, half  Dutch — or maybe something 
Cancelled something    . . .    I notice a protuberance, a small growth 
At the edge of  his eye, hanging like a broken thread 

I always thought, I say, your daughter had a charming 
Personality. He hunches his shoulders. Waking to dread, 
The debts of  dread — but I couldn't help him. 
Neither did I want to. On the way out 
I spot my first wife chatting with a small-time gangster — 
She flutters a wave my way, a Victorian flutter

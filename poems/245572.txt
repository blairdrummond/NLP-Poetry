title : Woman Watches Ocean on a Reef through a Glass-Bottomed Boat

author : Angela Jackson

text : 
In the ocean one fish
 swallows the other:
 a geometric progression of
 loss.
 You are bigger than I.
 The calamity of love
 swelling out larger than us.
 And what destiny partakes of
 our dilemma?
 Swallows the cause and effect:
 eyes and kissing mouths and enlarged
 parts wanting to breathe and wanting.
  
 There is no gentle sense to this.
 Is there?
 Only a kind of terror
 at the chain
 of events, the scale of loss, the ordered
  
 destruction one against the other—
 all that something larger
 awaits its moment.

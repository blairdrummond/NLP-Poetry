Sonnet

I find no peace, and all my war is done. 
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice. 
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise; 
And nought I have, and all the world I season. 
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison 
And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no wise-- 
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device, 
And yet of death it giveth me occasion. 
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain. 
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health. 
I love another, and thus I hate myself. 
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain; 
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death, 
And my delight is causer of this strife.

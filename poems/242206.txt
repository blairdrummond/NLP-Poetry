title : The Wound﻿

author : Tom Sleigh

When I woke the darkness was so thick,
 So palpable and black that my eyes
 Seemed blind as stone staring into stone.
  
 The blade that I had dreamed, efficient and quick
 As it cut into my thigh, cleaning a gangrened
 Wound infected to the bone, seemed poised
  
 Above my throat: Close-grained, impenetrable,
 The blackness rose before me like a wall.
 And then off in the next room, nervous, light,
  
 A soft padding as of an animal
 Raced like my heartbeat in my temples
 Round and round, trapped, stealthily desperate
  
 As if hunting its own track, terrified
 And captivated by its own odor.
 Skin cool in the night air, eyes drilling
  
 Through the dark, who I was before I
 Slept had burned off like a vapor
 So that amnesiac and pure, witnessing
  
 My terror that I no longer recognized
 As my own, my mind floated beyond me
 To confront that frantic, closing footfall
  
 As Jacob dreaming met his dark angel—
 Though in my wrestling nothing blessed me
 Or promised any blessing; but was a mask whose eyes
  
 Were all black pupil, blind as molten tar.
 I strained to see what paced there, my eyes burning
 Through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed
  
 Back across the blackness, an insistent, glazed
 Staring that shimmered and disappeared.
 The shining blade plunged at my throat, my mind
  
 Stretched and twisted, its wires tightening
 And turning as the creature lunged back and forth
 And with a deep-throated yowling, thrashing
  
 And thrashing to fight clear of its own circling,
 Cleanly leapt away. I reached for the knife
 But gripped only air, my eyes pressing
  
 Deeper and deeper into the night’s black stone,
 Cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound,
 Probing for the white shining of the bone:
  
 What had I become? What darkness had my dream
 Led me down into? Too frightened even 
 To move, I lay bound and sweating in
  
 The sheets, the moon a warning-bell beating
 On the glass, its light carving out the curtains
 Like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane.

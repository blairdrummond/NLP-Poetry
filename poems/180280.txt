title : The Train

Not that anyone will care, 
But as I was sitting there 

On the 8:07 
To New Haven, 

I was struck by lightning. 
The strangest thing 

Wasn't the flash of my hair 
Catching on fire, 

But the way people pretended 
Nothing had happened. 

For me, it was real enough. 
But it seemed as if 

The others saw this as nothing 
But a way of happening, 

A way to get from one place 
To another place, 

But not a place itself. 
So, ignored, I burned to death. 

Later, someone sat in my seat 
And my ashes ruined his suit.

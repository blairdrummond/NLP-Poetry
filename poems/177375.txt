title : Psalm

author : George Oppen

text : 
Veritas sequitur ...
In the small beauty of the forest 
The wild deer bedding down— 
That they are there! 

                              Their eyes 
Effortless, the soft lips 
Nuzzle and the alien small teeth 
Tear at the grass 

                              The roots of it 
Dangle from their mouths 
Scattering earth in the strange woods. 
They who are there. 

                              Their paths 
Nibbled thru the fields, the leaves that shade them 
Hang in the distances 
Of sun 

                              The small nouns 
Crying faith 
In this in which the wild deer   
Startle, and stare out.

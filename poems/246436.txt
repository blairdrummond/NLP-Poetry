for Thomas Green Bethune
Thar he blows! Plus, tusks 
crushed into grins, grins 
host to, guest of, impish

Nature, her fort/da “jewels”
glassified behind blank
opposable pupils—Ahabit perfected

(“perhaps memory”) by/for the dicey 
Veil. Auto-didact/-dialectics 
staged in rent-to-rent

“crowded houses,” asea to har-har-
poon Terrible Tom’s tom-tom 
stutter—VAC  C . Gone

but for “language, music, 
imitation and perhaps memory.”
Owns no umbrella to forget to splay

open like a bucket. Can’t cast 
down, can’t go singin’ in 
the there.

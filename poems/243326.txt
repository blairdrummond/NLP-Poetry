 She was twenty-two. He was fifty-three,
 a duke, a widower with ten children.
  
 They met in Paris, each in exile from
 the English Civil War. Virginal
  
 and terrified, still she agreed
 to marry him. Though women were mere chattel
  
 spinsterhood made you invisible
 in the sixteen hundreds. Marriage was arranged
  
 —hers a rare exception. Despite a dowry
 a woman never could own property.
  
 Your womb was just for rent. Birth control
 contrivances—a paste of ants, cow dung
  
 mashed with honey, tree bark with pennyroyal—
 all too often failed the applicant.

 If anything went wrong you bled to death.
 You bore & bore & bore as you were taught
 screaming sometimes for days in childbirth.
 To bring forth was a woman’s fate
  
 but not for Margaret Cavendish, childless
 Duchess of Newcastle. After the head
 of Charles the First had been detached
 and the Restoration seated a new monarch,
  
 she and the duke returned to his estate
 where nothing discomposed their paradise.
 How rare, two lovers scribbling away,
 admiring each other’s words in privacy.
 He: polymath, equestrian, playwright.
 She: philosopher, fantasist, poet.

 His the first book on the art of dressage,
 till then an untried humane approach
 to teaching classic paces in the manège,
 the grace of the levade and the piaffe.
  
 Hers the goofy utopian fantasy,
 The Blazing-World. The heroine is adrift
 with her kidnapper in a wooden skiff.
 A storm comes up conveniently, and they 
 are blown to the North Pole. He freezes to death
 but she is carried to a contiguous
 North Pole, a new world where the emperor
 falls in love with her, makes her his empress
  
 and cedes her all his powers over
 clans of wildly invented creatures.

 Poems, plays, philosophical
 discourses on Platonick love, 
 a chapter on her Birth, Breeding, and Life
 and an Apology for Writing so Much
 Upon this Book about herself,
 even some inquiries into science…
 years in chosen isolation the Duchess
 filled with words, and the Duke with reassurance.
  
 Even this outburst did not discomfit him:
 Men are so unconscionable and cruel
 …they would fain Bury us in their...beds as in
 a grave…[T]he truth is, we live like Bats or Owls,
 Labour like Beasts, and die like Worms. Pepys 
 called her mad, conceited, and ridiculous.

 Virginia Woolf, in 1928,
 found her Quixotic and high-spirited
 as well as somewhat crack-brained and bird witted
 but went on to see in her a vein
 of authentic fire. Eighty-odd years on,
 flamboyant, eccentric, admittedly vain,
  
 now she’s a respected foremother among
 women of letters. Founded in 1997,
 the Margaret Cavendish Society
 — “international, established to provide
 communication between scholars worldwide”—
 is plumped with learned papers, confabs, dues.
 She’s an aristocrat who advocates
 —words worn across centuries—for women’s rights.

 I went to college in the nineteen forties
 read Gogol, Stendhal, Zola, Flaubert.
 Read Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky
 and wrote exams that asked: contrast and compare.
  
 Male novelists, male profs, male tutors, not 
 a single woman on the faculty
 nor was there leaven found among the poets
 I read and loved: G.M. Hopkins, A.E.
 Housman, Auden, Yeats, only Emily
 (not quite decoded or yet in the canon).
 Ten years later, I struggled to break in 
 the almost all-male enclave of poetry.
  
 Here’s a small glimpse in the the hierarchy:
 famed Robert Lowell praising Marianne

 as the best woman poet in America, put down
 by Langston Hughes, bless his egalitarian
 soul, who rose at the dinner to pronounce 
 her the best Negro woman poet in the nation.
  
 Terrified of writing domestic poems, 
 poems pungent with motherhood, anathema
 to the prevailing clique of male pooh-bahs,
 somehow I balanced teaching freshman comp
 half-time with kids, meals, pets, errands, spouse.
 I wrote in secret, read drafts on the phone
 with another restless mother, Anne Sexton,
 and poco a poco our poems filled up the house.
  
 Then one of us sold a poem to The New Yorker.
 A week later, the other was welcomed in Harper’s.

 But even  as we published our first books
 the visiting male bards required care.
 We drove them to their readings far and near,
  
 thence to the airport just in time to make
 their flight to the next gig. You drive like a man,
 they said by way of praise, and if a poem
  
 of ours seemed worthy they said, you write like a man.
 When asked what woman poet they read, with one
 voice they declaimed, Emily Dickinson.
  
 Saintly Emily safely dead. Modern
 women poets were dismissed as immature,
 their poems pink with the glisten of female organs.
  
 The virus of their disdain hung in the air
 but women were now infected with ambition.

 We didn’t merely saunter decade by decade.
 We swept on past de Beauvoir and Friedan,
 and took courage from Carolyn Kizer’s knife-blade
 Pro Femina: I will speak about women
 of letters for I’m in the racket, urging,
 Stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors.
  
 If a woman is to write, Virginia Woolf
 has Mary Beton declare, she has to have
 five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door,
 a sacred space where Shakespeare’s sister Judith
 might have equaled his prodigious gift
 or not. She might have simply floated there, 
 set loose in the privilege of privacy, her self
 unwritten, under no one else’s eyes…

 Oh, Duchess, come hurdle five centuries
 to a land of MFA’s in poetry,
 of journals in print and even more online,
 small presses popping up like grapes on vines,
 reading staking place in every cranny,
 prizes for first books, some with money.
  
 Come to this apex of tenured women professors
 where sessions on gender and race fill whole semesters
 and students immerse themselves in women’s studies.
 Meet famous poets who are also unabashed mothers
 or singletons by choice or same-sex partners—
 black, Latina, Asian, native American, 
 white , Christian, Muslim, Jew and atheist—
 come join us, Duchess Margaret Cavendish.

Rhymed Stanza

The leaves talked in the twilight, dear;   
   Hearken the tale they told:   
How in some far-off place and year,   
   Before the world grew old, 

I was a dreaming forest tree, 
   You were a wild, sweet bird 
Who sheltered at the heart of me 
   Because the north wind stirred; 

How, when the chiding gale was still,   
   When peace fell soft on fear, 
You stayed one golden hour to fill 
   My dream with singing, dear. 

To-night the self-same songs are sung   
   The first green forest heard; 
My heart and the gray world grow young-- 
   To shelter you, my bird.

title : Give It Back

author : Don Bogen

text : 
Give it back—I made it all up
That alcove where surplus glowed under dust
Unfinished, an attic space with nails poking down
Khaki of sheet metal, orange flickering in tubes
Ephemeral as the smells, which were plywood, solder, and Kents
Color words, smell words—I put them in a book
Everything there is still missing
Two lies of remembrance: it was always winter
Things could speak

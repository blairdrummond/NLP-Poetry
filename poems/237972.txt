title : Bach in the DC Subway

author : David Lee Garrison

text : 
As an experiment,
The Washington Post
 asked a concert violinist—
 wearing jeans, tennis shoes,
 and a baseball cap—
 to stand near a trash can
 at rush hour in the subway
 and play Bach
 on a Stradivarius.
Partita No. 2 in D Minor
 called out to commuters
 like an ocean to waves,
 sang to the station
 about why we should bother
 to live.
  
 A thousand people
 streamed by.  Seven of them
 paused for a minute or so
 and thirty-two dollars floated
 into the open violin case.
 A café hostess who drifted
 over to the open door
 each time she was free
 said later that Bach
 gave her peace,
 and all the children,
 all of them,
 waded into the music
 as if it were water,
 listening until they had to be
 rescued by parents
 who had somewhere else to go.

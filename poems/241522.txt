title : Exercise 8 (12/4/00 AM)

author : Catherine Wagner

text : 
Raise up your back like an insect on the face of the nation
 He took Miss Mousie on his knee, O say
 little mouse will you marry me?
 Getting hair cut this morning illegally
 I can’﻿t afford it
 Fourteen fifteen I depend on you and roiling unlap this morn
 The mind refrigerated all night
 Now to clarify the broth skim off the oil & swallow it is your oil
 I must have it shorter so it grows longer in unison
 A glory and stern grandeur, which men silently gazed on with wonder
     and tears

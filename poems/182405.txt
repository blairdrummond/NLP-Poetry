title : from “Origins of Poetry”

author : Joel Lipman

text : 
  Joel Lipman has worked for years with rubber stamps, creating poems on yellowing acidic pages torn out of old books. This technique produces a frisson between the apparently unrelated base text and Lipman's overtext. As evidenced by the meter and movement of the words on the page above, it is clear that Lipman is writing real poetry, but it is poetry enhanced by the distinctive appearance of the words.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

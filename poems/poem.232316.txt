The Props assist the House (729)

Common Measure, Metaphor

The Props assist the House 
Until the House is built 
And then the Props withdraw 
And adequate, erect, 
The House support itself 
And cease to recollect 
The Augur and the Carpenter - 
Just such a retrospect 
Hath the perfected Life - 
A Past of Plank and Nail 
And slowness - then the scaffolds drop 
Affirming it a Soul -

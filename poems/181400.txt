title : Weighing In

author : Rhina P. Espaillat

text : 
What the scale tells you is how much the earth 
has missed you, body, how it wants you back 
again after you leave it to go forth 

into the light. Do you remember how 
earth hardly noticed you then? Others would rock 
you in their arms, warm in the flow 

that fed you, coaxed you upright. Then earth began 
to claim you with spots and fevers, began to lick 
at you with a bruised knee, a bloody shin, 

and finally to stoke you, body, drumming 
intimate coded messages through music 
you danced to unawares, there in your dreaming 

and your poems and your obedient blood. 
Body, how useful you became, how lucky, 
heavy with news and breakage, rich, and sad, 

sometimes, imagining that greedy zero 
you must have been, that promising empty sack 
of possibilities, never-to-come tomorrow. 

But look at you now, body, soft old shoe 
that love wears when itâ€™s stirring, look down, look 
how earth wants what you weigh, needs what you know.

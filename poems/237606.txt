We fought in Salem,
 as she nosed the rented car
 through streets that
 stubbornly refused to match
 the squiggled lines
 accordioning from my lap.
 She pressed me for direction
 as I spun the folding paper
 like a compass point,
 urged me for instruction
 as I traced the lines like Braille,
 my fingers blinded,
 tapping out the spell of history;
 I could not navigate this town.

 How could I explain
 the pall of Salem?
 There’s not an inch on Earth
 that isn't steeped in blood—
 corpses pushing up the cobblestones
 in every town,
 and the buildings that blunt the sky
 are girdered in bone.
 One could travel anywhere
 and feel that chill,
 the hovering of ghosts
 above the landscape,
 the past’s damp breath
 against the ear.

 This town, though,
 descended like a shroud
 upon my holiday;
 Salem,
 its rectilinearity
 compressed the ribbon of my spine
 and sealed my thighs
 like doorways to a crypt;
 Salem,
 its somber abnegation,
 grimmest reprobation
 sought to suck me to a hollow shell
 through which the vengeful cries of God
 then could be heard. 

 My lover, steering wheel in hand,
 stared into narrow streets
 with the eyes of a dark bird.
 “Which way,” she cawed, “which way?”
 But mine glowed with the blankness
 of a woman swaying from a noose,
 clothing asunder,
 curses drowning in an airless throat,
 spirit driven from its home;
 it circled now above our heads.
 The useless atlas crumpled at my feet,
 it could not lead me to a place
 where threat did not bear down like heavy stones;
 we fought in Salem.

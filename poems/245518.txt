Lotan Baba, a holy man from India, rolled on his side for             four thousand kilometers across the country in his quest for             world peace and eternal salvation.                                                                                                                     —Reuters 
He started small: fasting here and there,
 days, then weeks. Once, he stood under
 a banyan tree for a full seven years, sitting
             for nothing—not even to sleep. It came
             to him in a dream: You must roll
             on this earth, spin your heart in rain,
                         desert, dust. At sunrise he’d stretch, swab
                         any cuts from the day before, and lay prone
                         on the road while his twelve men swept
             the ground in front of him with sisal brooms.
             Even monkeys stopped and stared at this man
             rolling through puddles, past storefronts
 where children would throw him pieces
 of butter candy he’d try and catch
 in his mouth at each rotation. His men
             swept and sang, swept and sang
             of jasmine-throated angels
             and pineapple slices in kulfi cream.
                         He rolled and rolled. Sometimes
                         in his dizzying spins, he thought
                         he heard God. A whisper, but still.

title : All the Dead Soldiers

author : Thomas McGrath

text : 
In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something—
A puling anger, a cold wind stiffened by flying bone—
Out of the north ... 
                               and remember, then, what’s up there: 
That ghost-bank: home: Amchitka: boot hill ....

They must be very tired, those ghosts; no flesh sustains them
And the bones rust in the rain.
                                              Reluctant to go into the earth
The skulls gleam: wet; the dog-tag forgets the name;
The statistics (wherein they were young) like their crosses, are weathering out,

They must be very tired.
                                     But I see them riding home, 
Nightly: crying weak lust and rage: to stand in the dark, 
Forlorn in known rooms, unheard near familiar beds: 
Where lie the aging women: who were so lovely: once.

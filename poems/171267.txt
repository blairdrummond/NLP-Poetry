title : Babylon Revisited

author : Amiri Baraka

text : 
The gaunt thing   
with no organs 
creeps along the streets 
of Europe, she will 
commute, in her feathered bat stomach-gown 
with no organs 
with sores on her insides 
even her head 
a vast puschamber   
of pus(sy) memories 
with no organs 
nothing to make babies 
she will be the great witch of euro-american legend 
who sucked the life 
from some unknown nigger 
whose name will be known 
but whose substance will not ever   
not even by him 
who is dead in a pile of dopeskin 

This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob Thompson   
a black painter, a giant, once, she reduced 
to a pitiful imitation faggot 
full of American holes and a monkey on his back   
slapped airplanes 
from the empire state building 

May this bitch and her sisters, all of them,   
receive my words 
in all their orifices like lye mixed with   
cocola and alaga syrup 

feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your   
hysterectic laughs 
while your flesh burns 
and your eyes peel to red mud

title : Speckled Trout

Water-flesh gleamed like mica: 
orange fins, red flankspots, a char 
shy as ginseng, found only 
in spring-flow gaps, the thin clear 
of faraway creeks no map 
could name. My cousin showed me 
those hidden places. I loved 
how we found them, the way we 
followed no trail, just stream-sound 
tangled in rhododendron, 
to where slow water opened 
a hole to slip a line in, 
and lift as from a well bright 
shadows of another world, 
held in my hand, their color 
already starting to fade.

title : After The Pillow Book

author : Peter Pereira

text : 
You call me to the bath, where 
by evening light before bed I rub 
the ointment into your maculate back. 
I place my hand between the wings 
of your scapulae, where you cannot 
reach, cannot see—the arc of your life 
revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored 
spots—and hover there awhile, 
remembering how we watched the lover 
read the manuscript painted on the skin 
of his beloved; how he pressed 
the words to his chest and face—and cried out. 
The arteries in my palm open, their warmth 
rising between us as I massage you, neither 
sexual nor umbilical, 
this connection—you trusting 
your back to me, and 
me with no deceit. 
Only salve, only unguent. 
Only balm.

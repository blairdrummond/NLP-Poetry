title : The Poet

author : Yone Noguchi

text : 
Out of the deep and the dark, 
A sparkling mystery, a shape, 
Something perfect, 
Comes like the stir of the day: 
One whose breath is an odor, 
Whose eyes show the road to stars, 
The breeze in his face, 
The glory of heaven on his back. 
He steps like a vision hung in air, 
Diffusing the passion of eternity; 
His abode is the sunlight of morn, 
The music of eve his speech: 
In his sight, 
One shall turn from the dust of the grave, 
And move upward to the woodland.

I 

So you have swept me back, 
I who could have walked with the live souls 
above the earth, 
I who could have slept among the live flowers 
at last; 

so for your arrogance 
and your ruthlessness 
I am swept back 
where dead lichens drip 
dead cinders upon moss of ash; 

so for your arrogance 
I am broken at last, 
I who had lived unconscious, 
who was almost forgot; 

if you had let me wait 
I had grown from listlessness 
into peace, 
if you had let me rest with the dead, 
I had forgot you 
and the past. 

                               II 

Here only flame upon flame 
and black among the red sparks, 
streaks of black and light 
grown colourless; 

why did you turn back, 
that hell should be reinhabited 
of myself thus 
swept into nothingness? 

why did you glance back? 
why did you hesitate for that moment? 
why did you bend your face 
caught with the flame of the upper earth, 
above my face? 

what was it that crossed my face 
with the light from yours 
and your glance? 
what was it you saw in my face? 
the light of your own face, 
the fire of your own presence? 

What had my face to offer 
but reflex of the earth, 
hyacinth colour 
caught from the raw fissure in the rock 
where the light struck, 
and the colour of azure crocuses 
and the bright surface of gold crocuses 
and of the wind-flower, 
swift in its veins as lightning 
and as white. 

                               III 

Saffron from the fringe of the earth, 
wild saffron that has bent 
over the sharp edge of earth, 
all the flowers that cut through the earth, 
all, all the flowers are lost; 

everything is lost, 
everything is crossed with black, 
black upon black 
and worse than black, 
this colourless light. 

                               IV 

Fringe upon fringe 
of blue crocuses, 
crocuses, walled against blue of themselves, 
blue of that upper earth, 
blue of the depth upon depth of flowers, 
lost; 

flowers, 
if I could have taken once my breath of them, 
enough of them, 
more than earth, 
even than of the upper earth, 
had passed with me 
beneath the earth; 

if I could have caught up from the earth, 
the whole of the flowers of the earth, 
if once I could have breathed into myself 
the very golden crocuses 
and the red, 
and the very golden hearts of the first saffron, 
the whole of the golden mass, 
the whole of the great fragrance, 
I could have dared the loss. 

                              V 

So for your arrogance 
and your ruthlessness 
I have lost the earth   
and the flowers of the earth, 
and the live souls above the earth, 
and you who passed across the light 
and reached 
ruthless; 

you who have your own light, 
who are to yourself a presence, 
who need no presence; 

yet for all your arrogance 
and your glance, 
I tell you this: 

such loss is no loss, 
such terror, such coils and strands and pitfalls 
of blackness, 
such terror 
is no loss; 

hell is no worse than your earth 
above the earth, 
hell is no worse, 
no, nor your flowers 
nor your veins of light 
nor your presence, 
a loss; 

my hell is no worse than yours 
though you pass among the flowers and speak 
with the spirits above earth. 

                               VI 

Against the black 
I have more fervour 
than you in all the splendour of that place, 
against the blackness 
and the stark grey 
I have more light; 

and the flowers, 
if I should tell you, 
you would turn from your own fit paths 
toward hell, 
turn again and glance back 
and I would sink into a place 
even more terrible than this. 

                              VII 

At least I have the flowers of myself, 
and my thoughts, no god 
can take that; 
I have the fervour of myself for a presence 
and my own spirit for light; 

and my spirit with its loss 
knows this; 
though small against the black, 
small against the formless rocks, 
hell must break before I am lost; 

before I am lost, 
hell must open like a red rose 
for the dead to pass.

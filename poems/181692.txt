Pei designed the building with views,   
smooth masonry, and the mountains aligned 
for a photo opportunity; inside are files 
sufficient for forever, for fine tuning weather. 

Great Spangled Fritillary, the watcher vaguely recalls 
from Teach Yourself Lepidoptery, a book. 
He wanted to live in a land of appropriate weather 
with views of mountains and with music constant. 

He wants to tell a story but no one would listen, 
like opera: Black women clean the floors 
and shine the walls like silver nightly. 
Computers whir Platonic as nuns. Nothing 

escapes naming; storms arranged in teacups 
like anyone’s collection, like rows of butterflies 
pinned and satisfactory: this is the new landscape. 
Or there is a lewd father among the shrubbery 

watching daughters in weather; he breathes heavily 
and the wet wisdom begins, the storm gathering 
to spill across the ridge, longed for. 
Daughters must be warned against sincerity 

of frantic violins: “He was a man of sympathetic   
tendencies,” read the official report. “He was 
smaller than he looked and tended to lick chocolate 
from his fingers in a lascivious manner.” 

He tried his wife’s patience, it is true, 
and lived alone through the marriage, kept 
his own counsel. With such petty symbols as 
weather, he kept his own counsel. 

A butterfly like weather; the climate like 
laughter, the movement of small air. Clouds, too, 
have names. Clouds leave home to find themselves. 
Good money after bad, the fathers say, and close   

the door called Nature against their coming back. 
The funny little ways children have of making 
the world the color they always wanted. Sunset. 
Birds. The mathematics of memory begin 

to swirl like cookie dough, like chocolate with egg 
and sugar and vanilla and butter. A bowl to lick, 
dangerous with delight, as ultraviolet. Home again! 
begs the mother and soon the sorry child walks 

that long allée as rain begins to pour.   Past   
such petty symbols the boy returns through architecture,   
a silly gauntlet: the butterfly, the mother, the fit 
signatures of loveliness. His parents at the door, 

the little cottage in the woods, Hansel home again 
at last, the shining path. A little like a dream. 
Ours is not a simple age, and things are what they seem 
happily ever after in the malicious tiny rain.

The Poets light but Lamps -- (930) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Living, Death, Nature, Stars, Planets, Heavens



The Poets light but Lamps --
Themselves -- go out --
The Wicks they stimulate
If vital Light

Inhere as do the Suns --
Each Age a Lens
Disseminating their
Circumference --

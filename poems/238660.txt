title : The Roll Call

author : Thomas Sayers Ellis

text : 
Any half-decent rapper
Can conjure the dead,

Can reach into graves
And accuse God

Of Indian-giving.
The trick is ancestral,

No more magic than memory’s
Hidden strings & chains.

Trust me,
We haven’t forgotten a name.

Say them. Raise your hands.
Holler at me!

title : Better Late than Never

I was young once, at least, if not beautiful. 
And what is beauty anyway? The light off snow 
is pretty. I was young once, as young as any. 
After all, she thought, to know the edge 
of truth or of mountains, you need to lie or fall. 

Everyone has an inner life, O careless love, 
it's as simple as that. That's why they hurried 
to marry before the month endedâ€”fear of June. 
She would avert her eyes from the magazines' 
special issues with brides on their creamy covers. 

He worked to replace her money he'd squandered. 
Then came a time of last intimacy, her injections, 
when once a week he'd puncture with the silken needle 
her arm, her condition worse with age, her pain 
made him wince and call her Dear; her alluring allergies. 

From where they retired all views were distant, 
nothing true or tender at hand. Mountains to the west 
like pets kept for good weather or loneliness 
and the need for cold to gloat upon. 
They would sometimes think of history together, 

of the choked passes which killed, of the grasses of summer 
when water was rare and expensive as illicit love. 
With the interstate smooth as needles gleaming beneath 
the snow-slick peaks, they would think of pioneers 
lost and together, alas, two by two, with beds as baggage. 

Another edge to be cut on. She loves the little 
line of houses or trees in landscapes, the thin 
horizons hugely bearing the weight of drama 
and of sky with its tooth of cypress or steeple. 
And he, while he turned the wheel and tuned the radio, 

what was on his married mind? He remembers often, 
these latter days, the cousin he first loved, 
her marriage to an ugly man when he lit the candles 
and wore the little suit his mother made, 
and he cried for her because she was only beautiful. 

He remembered riding in the car from the library, 
having taken a book on Freud because his cousin 
was studying Freud, and such studies were forbidden 
his Catholic childhood. And riding in the back seat 
as his father drove he read about the fountain pen 

as phallic, the ink seed of Onan spilled, and he 
grew sick and felt the frisson of guilt and glory. 
And she was married to an ugly man, but the world 
conspires to avert its eyes, and the needle-sharp 
peaks hover behind them as the little dashes of white 

lines spurt out beneath their car on the highway home, 
a little line like spoor marking their path, so easy 
to retrace, ready made, like everyone's. So there's 
no need to look, just live long, since youth is truer 
than beauty, Love; long life and many children.

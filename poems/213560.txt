title : Introit & Fugue

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
After death, my father   
practices meticulously   
until the Bach is seamless,   
spun glass in a dream,   
you can no longer tell   
where the modulations are,   
or the pedal shifts 
or the split fingerings . . . 

if he rests 
it’s to wind the metronome   
or sip his cup of ice . . . 

but who is the other old man   
in the identical flannel gown,   
head cocked, listening 
ever more critically, 
deeper in the empty room?

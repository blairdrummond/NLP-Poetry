title : Focus

Photograph found in the road: bejeweled hand
 gripping a limp dick. All parties
 suffering from lack of ambition. The hills
 of Tuscany won’t dapple with sunlight,
 and here it is nearly noon. She didn’t 
 much want the leather jacket, the vendor didn’t
 really care to sell it, she hardly tried 
 it on, he barely praised her beauty, then
 everyone wasn’t hungry and went to lunch.
 The rubies won’t glow. The delayed train shrugs
 on its siding. The penis appears at ease.
 Osteria, osteria, osteria, osteria.
 I knew many words but preferred to say
 the same ones over and over, like
 a photographer shooting four frames
 of the same subject, hoping for one in focus.
 This clearly among the other three.

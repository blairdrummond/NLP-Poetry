title : Argonaut's Vow

author : Carol Frost

text : 
Pushed prow southerly into the golden wind: 

hurt the eyes: gold pelted water: so looked less far away: 

plovers huddling on the tide's last piece of shore: 

Rise up in brightness: clap wings:: 

I told myself I'll go where eagles go: if to brimstone: 

my wake a narrow river back 

to its source in cedar: and when sunlight embers 

the shore's soft fleece will be before me.

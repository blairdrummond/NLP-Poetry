text : 
I 
My wife is ill! 
And I sit 
             waiting 
for a quorum 


II 
Fast ride 
his horse collapsed 
Now he saddled walked 

Borrowed a farmer’s 
unbroken colt 
To Richmond 

Richmond How stop— 
Arnold’s redcoats 
there 


III 
Elk Hill destroyed— 
Cornwallis 
carried off 30 slaves 

Jefferson: 
Were it to give them freedom 
he’d have done right 


IV 
Latin and Greek 
my tools 
to understand 
humanity 

I rode horse 
away from a monarch 
to an enchanting 
philosophy 


V 
                           The South of France 

Roman temple 
“simple and sublime” 

Maria Cosway 
       harpist 
on his mind 


white column 
and arch 


VI 
To daughter Patsy: Read— 
read Livy 

No person full of work 
was ever hysterical 

Know music, history 
dancing 

(I calculate 14 to 1 
in marriage 
she will draw 
a blockhead) 

Science also 
Patsy 


VII 
Agreed with Adams: 
send spermaceti oil to Portugal 
for their church candles 

(light enough to banish mysteries?: 
three are one and one is three 
and yet the one not three 
and the three not one) 

and send salt fish 
U.S. salt fish preferred 
above all other 


VIII 
Jefferson of Patrick Henry 
backwoods fiddler statesman: 

“He spoke as Homer wrote” 
Henry eyed our minister at Paris— 

the Bill of Rights hassle— 
“he remembers . . . 

in splendor and dissipation 
he thinks yet of bills of rights” 


IX 
True, French frills and lace 
for Jefferson, sword and belt 

but follow the Court to Fontainebleau 
he could not— 

house rent would have left him 
nothing to eat 


. . . 


He bowed to everyone he met 
and talked with arms folded 

He could be trimmed 
by a two-month migraine 

and yet 
                stand up 


X 
Dear Polly: 
I said No—no frost 

in Virginia—the strawberries 
were safe 

I’d have heard—I’m in that kind 
of correspondence 

with a young daughter— 
if they were not 

Now I must retract 
I shrink from it 


XI 
Political honors 
            “splendid torments” 
“If one could establish 
            an absolute power 
of silence over oneself” 

When I set out for Monticello 
       (my grandchildren 
                will they know me?) 

How are my young 
                     chestnut trees— 


XII 
Hamilton and the bankers 
would make my country Carthage 

I am abandoning the rich— 
their dinner parties— 

I shall eat my simlins 
with the class of science 

or not at all 
Next year the last of labors 

among conflicting parties 
Then my family 

we shall sow our cabbages 
together 


XIII 
Delicious flower 
of the acacia 

or rather 

Mimosa Nilotica 
from Mr. Lomax 


XIV 
Polly Jefferson, 8, had crossed 
to father and sister in Paris 

by way of London—Abigail 
embraced her—Adams said 

“in all my life I never saw 
more charming child” 

Death of Polly, 25, 
Monticello 


XV 
My harpsichord 
my alabaster vase 
and bridle bit 
bound for Alexandria 
Virginia 

The good sea weather 
of retirement 
The drift and suck 
and die-down of life 
but there is land 


XVI 
These were my passions: 
Monticello and the villa-temples 
I passed on to carpenters 
bricklayers what I knew    

and to an Italian sculptor 
how to turn a volute 
on a pillar 

You may approach the campus rotunda 
from lower to upper terrace 
Cicero had levels    


XVII 
John Adams’ eyes 
            dimming 
Tom Jefferson’s rheumatism 
                              cantering 


XVIII 
Ah soon must Monticello be lost 
                   to debts 
   and Jefferson himself 
                                     to death 


XIX 
Mind leaving, let body leave 
Let dome live, spherical dome 
and colonnade 

Martha (Patsy) stay 
“The Committee of Safety 
must be warned” 

Stay youth—Anne and Ellen 
all my books, the bantams 
and the seeds of the senega root

title : Maudlin; Or, The Magdalen’s Tears

author : Linda Gregerson

text : 
If faith is a tree that sorrow grows 
and women, repentant or not, are swamps, 

a man who comes for solace here   
will be up to his knees and slow 

getting out. A name can turn on anyone.   
But say that a woman washes the dust 

from a stranger’s feet 
and sits quite dry-eyed in front 

of her mirror at night. 
The candle flame moves with her breath, as does 

the hand of the painter, who sees in the flame   
his chance for virtuosity. She lets him leave 

her shoulder bare. 
Bedlam’s distilled from a Mary too, 

St. Mary’s of Bethlehem, shelter   
for all the afflicted and weak 

of mind. The donors conceived of as magi   
no doubt. The mad and the newborn 

serve equally well for show.   
A whore with a heart, the rich 

with a conscience, the keepers of language   
and hospitals badly embarrassed at times 

by their charge. The mirror refuses 
the candle, you see. And tears on another’s behalf 

are not 
the mirrors he’s pleased to regard. 

Who loves his ironies buxom and grave   
must hate the foolish water of her eyes.

Haze of wave spume towards Small Point, 
       Seguin Island Light like a whale's spout— 
maybe life washes itself here, cools off. 
       It never comes clean. See all the sails up 
and full in the windy parade of skin 
       and sand and brine. Soon the rocks will pluck 
each wave's feathers. Soon the beach 
       like the moon, waning, will be 1/8th its size. 
Somewhere else—maybe Ireland—the tide 
       will bottom out then. For now the sun 
blesses the bodies at home in theirs, 
       and those less so, to ruin and ruin's aftermath— 
whatever that is—and the waves rolling in, 
       little snowplows, nimbus in miniature; how 
the beach fishhooks east, one child— 
       is that mine, or some spirit I was one more 
usher of?—face up, arms and legs 
       scraping a temporary angel in the sand.

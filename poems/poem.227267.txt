Lines Composed 21st February 1825
All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair-- 
The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing-- 
And Winter slumbering in the open air, 
Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring! 
And I the while, the sole unbusy thing, 
Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing. 

         Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow, 
Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow. 
Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may, 
For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away! 
With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll: 
And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul? 
Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve, 
And Hope without an object cannot live.

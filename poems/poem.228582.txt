Sonnet

Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance 
Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize, 
Both by the judgment of the English eyes 
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France; 
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance, 
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies 
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise; 
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance; 
Others, because of both sides I do take 
My blood from them who did excel in this, 
Think Nature me a man of arms did make. 
How far they shot awry! The true cause is, 
Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face 
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.

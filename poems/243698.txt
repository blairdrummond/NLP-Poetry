title : High and Bright and Fine and Ice

When the motorboat man asked me to love him
  
 I whispered precipice
 the word for the no-more-boyfriend feeling
  
 because precipice contains ice (practically twice)
 because I wanted teetering—
  
  
 What? he said
 Yes
  
 His ears from the engines—so hard of hearing—his hands always
   so hot
  
  
 Mid our first winter—I’d clung so long to the dock
 he had to crowbar my fingers off
  
 Each digit cracked so cleanly
 Would you say they break like icicles? I asked sweetly
  
  
 I knew I was nothing! But if I could sustain one song—
 I is, I is, I is I is I is
  
 I could be: ice
  
  
 Sex on the bathroom’s cold marble counter was best
 I whispered statuette, monument
  
 What? he, sculpting my legs, said
  
 Yes
  
  
 The child? I named her Cecily
 It sounded like iced lily
  
  
 For pure, I said pristine
 At the ocean, I said brine
  
 Isle for vacation; for flowers, edelweiss
  
 But when I said (only of late, late!) I choose ice
 Brittle pearls broke behind my syllables
  
 Did he hear me?
 Again, twice, thrice:
  
 For my love
 we would need to live 
 in a great pyramid
 We would need to sleep
 beneath the continental shelf
 with Antarctic crust blanketing us
 The only driveway to any kind of house
 is an iceberg-ridden Northwest Passage
 When I whispered universe
 you were to translate it as
 one bright line
 one bright rime

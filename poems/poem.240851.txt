As the immense dew of Florida 
 Brings forth
 The big-finned palm
 And green vine angering for life,
  
 As the immense dew of Florida
 Brings forth hymn and hymn
 From the beholder,
 Beholding all these green sides
 And gold sides of green sides,
  
 And blessed mornings,
 Meet for the eye of the young alligator,
 And lightning colors
 So, in me, come flinging
 Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.

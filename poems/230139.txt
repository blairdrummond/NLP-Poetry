CONFIDENCE 
       (after Bashō) 

Clouds murmur darkly,   
it is a blinding habit— 
gazing at the moon. 


TIME OF JOY 
       (after Buson) 

Spring means plum blossoms   
and spotless new kimonos   
for holiday whores. 


RENDEZVOUS 
       (after Shiki) 

Once more as I wait 
for you, night and icy wind   
melt into cold rain. 


FOR SATORI 

In the spring of joy, 
when even the mud chuckles,   
my soul runs rabid, 
snaps at its own bleeding heels,   
and barks: “What is happiness?” 


SOMBER GIRL 

She never saw fire 
from heaven or hotly fought   
with God; but her eyes 
smolder for Hiroshima 
and the cold death of Buddha.

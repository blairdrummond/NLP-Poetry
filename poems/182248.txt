Pass by the showy rose, 
blabbing open, 
suckling a shiny beetle; 

pass by the changeless diamond 
that falls asleep in shadowâ€” 

this love is a lichen, 

alga and fungus made one fleck, 
feeding on what it feeds, 

growing slightly faster than stone 
into a patch of gray lace, 
a double thumbprint, 

its bloom distinguishable, with practice, 
from its dormant phase, 

crocheting its singular habit 
over time, a faithful stain 
bound to its home, 

etching on the unmoved rock 
the only rune it knows.

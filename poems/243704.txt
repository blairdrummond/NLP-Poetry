Give me your tired, your poor,
 Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
 The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
 Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
 I lift my lamp beside the golden door!
 Give me your gentrificatees of the Lower East Side including all the well-heeled young Europeans who’ll take apartments without leases
 Give me your landlords, give me your cooperators
 Give me the guys who sell the food and the computers to the public schools in District One
 Give me the IRS-FBI-CIA men who don’t take election day off
 Give me the certain members of the school board & give me the district superintendent
 Give me all the greedy members of both american & foreign capitalist religious sects
 Give me the parents of the punk people
 Give me the guy who puts those stickers in the Rice Krispies
 Give me the doctor who thinks his time is more valuable than mine and my daughter’s & the time of all the other non-doctors in this world
 Give me the mayor, his mansion, and the president & his white house
 Give me the cops who laugh and sneer at meetings where they demonstrate the new uses of mace and robots instead of the old murder against people who are being evicted
 Give me the landlord’s sleazy lawyers and the deal-making judges in housing court & give me the landlord’s arsonist
 Give me the known & unknown big important rich guys who now bank on our quaint neighborhood
 Give me, forgive me, the writers who have already or want to write bestsellers in this country
 Together we will go to restore Ellis Island, ravaged for years by wind, weather and vandals
 I was surprised and saddened when I heard that the Statue of Liberty was in such a serious state of disrepair & I want to help
 This is the most generous contribution I can afford.

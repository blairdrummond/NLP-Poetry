title : Beauty and the Illiterate

author : Odysseus Elytis

text : 
Often, in the Repose of Evening her soul took a lightness from 
                  the mountains across, although the day was harsh and 
                  tomorrow foreign. 

But, when it darkened well and out came the priest’s hand over 
                  the little garden of the dead, She 

Alone, Standing, with the few domestics of the night—the blowing 
                  rosemary and the murmur of smoke from the kilns— 
                  at sea’s entry, wakeful 

Otherly beauty! 

Only the waves’ words half-guessed or in a rustle, and others 
                  resembling the dead’s that startle in the cypress, strange 
                  zodiacs that lit up her magnetic moon-turned head. 
                  And one 

Unbelievable cleanliness allowed, to great depth in her, the real 
                  landscape to be seen, 

Where, near the river, the dark ones fought against the Angel, 
                  exactly showing how she’s born, Beauty 

Or what we otherwise call tear. 

And long as her thinking lasted, you could feel it overflow the 
                  glowing sight bitterly in the eyes and the huge, like an 
                  ancient prostitute’s, cheekbones 

Stretched to the extreme points of the Large Dog and of the Virgin. 

“Far from the pestilential city I dreamed of her deserted place 
                  where a tear may have no meaning and the only light be 
                  from the flame that ravishes all that for me exists. 

“Shoulder-to-shoulder under what will be, sworn to extreme silence 
                  and the co-ruling of the stars, 

“As if I didn’t know yet, the illiterate, that there exactly, in extreme 
                  silence are the most repellent thuds 

“And that, since it became unbearable inside a man’s chest, solitude 
                  dispersed and seeded stars!”

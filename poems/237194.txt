title : The Untamed

author : R. S. Thomas

text : 
My garden is the wild
   Sea of the grass. Her garden
Shelters between walls.
   The tide could break in;
   I should be sorry for this.

There is peace there of a kind,
   Though not the deep peace
Of wild places. Her care
   For green life has enabled
   The weak things to grow.

Despite my first love,
   I take sometimes her hand,
Following straight paths
   Between flowers, the nostril
   Clogged with their thick scent.

The old softness of lawns
   Persuading the slow foot
Leads to defection; the silence
   Holds with its gloved hand
   The wild hawk of the mind.

But not for long, windows,
   Opening in the trees
Call the mind back
   To its true eyrie; I stoop
   Here only in play.

I.
  
 sound knots 
  
 pinned to a fabric-less body form of oak bone
  
 a barreled chest
  
  
 the presence of acoustic music over the instrument
  
 resting on your lap
  
  
 a limited vehicle               but you knew that
  
 having learned tablature
  
 the guitar posed in sculpture
  
 clear its throat by reaching the oval gap flushed
  
 against stomach into its curious sound
  
 gather fingers around an inexhaustible voice and play the strings

  
 II. 
  
 bread shaped to song as we ate and fidgeted
  
 the pitch of river
 frozen to stillness           a film
 reeled and taut
  
 swelling water
 oily in its cold 
 steps before it hardens
  
 an utterance before song is shaped
  
 a compression of freezing water
 eating away at its own babbling face


 III.
  
 where are the boxes of clothes
  
 the newspaper to scoop inside of cups
  
 feel free to comment
  
 miss nothing as of chewing a new food
  
 these are features of comfort
  
 a lower altitude,
  
 moved further but           no egg crate to snug the ends of the hutch
  
  
 a chimera of tempered sand
  
 speak of her house absolved by the wiping ocean
  
 speak of her name by way of mountains
  
 the mirrors          silver flaking for the edges of the mirrors
  
 leaving only glass             unreflective patches
  
  
 the promised half
  
 the unanswerable ruin of aperture                       begging
  
 from where you haven’t seen yourself in years

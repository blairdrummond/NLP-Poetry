text : 
dreaming the lives of the ancestors,
 you awake, justly terrified of this world:
 you could dance underwater and not get wet,
 you hear, but the pressure is drowning you:
  
 you’re awake, but just terrified of this world,
 where all solids are ice: underwater boogie,
 you hear, but the press sure is drowning you:
the igbo were walking, not dancing:

where all solids are ice, underwater boogie
is good advice, because they’re quick to melt:
 the igbo were straight up walking, not dancing:
 and you’ve still got to get through this life:
  
 take my advice, quickly: they’re melting:
 you could dance underwater and not get wet:
 and you’ve got to, to get through this life still
 dreaming the lives of the ancestors

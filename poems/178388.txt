title : In The Summer After “Issue Year” Winter (1873)

I scratch earth around timpsila 
on this hill, while below me, 
hanging in still air, a hawk 
searches the creekbed for my brothers.   
Squat leaves, I’ll braid your roots   
into such long ropes, they’ll cover   
the rump of my stallion. 
Withered flower, feed us now 
buffalo rot in the waist-high grass. 

Hear my sisters laugh? 
They dream of feasts, of warriors   
to owl dance with them 
when this war is over. They don’t see   
our children eating treebark, cornstalks,   
these roots. Their eyes gleam 
in shallow cheeks. The wagon people   
do not think relationship is wealth. 

Sisters, last night the wind 
returned my prayer, allowing me to hear   
Dog Soldiers singing at Ash Hollow.   
I threw away my blanket 
stained with lies. 
Above the wings of my tipi, 
I heard the old woman in Maka Sica 
sigh for us. Then I knew 
the distance of High Back Bone’s death- 
fire from another world away. Even they   
may never stop its motion. 

Yesterday at noon, I heard 
my Cheyenne sister moan as she waded   
through deep snow before soldiers 
cut up her corpse to sell 
as souvenirs. Are my brothers 
here? Ghosts bring all my joy. 
I walk this good road between rock 
and sky. They dare not threaten with death   
one already dead.

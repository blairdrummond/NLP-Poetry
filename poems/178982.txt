title : Thinking of Darwin

author : Herbert Morris

text : 
Were it not for that photograph,   
disaster in its final stages, 
matchbox houses coming down,   
rubble of streets, uprooted trees, 
lives we somehow could not envision,   
removed from us and not our own,   
on distant coasts the fall of night, 

we might never have thought of Darwin,   
remembered what we had forgotten, 
nothing but desert at our backs, 
somewhere the light gone grey, gone green,   
the very texture of the air 
evoking strangeness in us, distance, 
deepwater harbor on the rim 
of an island whose aspirations, 
despite itself, assume proportions   
hemispheric, continental, 
set adrift in uncharted waters 
where a wind from the Timor Sea 
smacks of Celebes, of Java, 
celebrates archipelagoes 
for which no names have been devised, 

where rain runs green, and rocks dream gold,   
where every morning, on our tongues,   
we taste the raging of the dust 
gathering at abandoned stations 
and know, or come to know, the life,   
the littoral on which we wait, 
though not yet clearly its true name,   
not precisely its purpose with us; 

where, naked, night to night, inventing   
names for our nakedness, we lie   
suspended under the Equator 
between the wastes of self and weather,   
trying to learn ourselves, our names,   
what to make of this emptiness, 
this sense of absence which afflicts us,   
forgetting what we must remember, 

the great Australian coast spun out   
beyond our scrutiny in shales,   
corals, limestones, salt scrub, sand,   
discovery at every turn 
and, this far south, no turning back,   
latitudes of impossible 
dimensions bleaching the horizon,   
mapping what will not quite stay mapped,   
nothing but desert at our backs,   
nothing but darkness to advance on,   
night on the routes that enter strangeness   
more dangerously, in the evening,   
than we can bring ourselves to say,   
darkness and an interior 
for which, of course, there is no name   
except, unmapped, unknown, ourselves.

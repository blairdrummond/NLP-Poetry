title : Question

author : May Swenson

text : 
Body my house 
my horse my hound   
what will I do 
when you are fallen 

Where will I sleep   
How will I ride   
What will I hunt 

Where can I go 
without my mount   
all eager and quick   
How will I know   
in thicket ahead 
is danger or treasure   
when Body my good   
bright dog is dead 

How will it be 
to lie in the sky 
without roof or door   
and wind for an eye 

With cloud for shift   
how will I hide?

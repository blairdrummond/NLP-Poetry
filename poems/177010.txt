text : 
My husband has a crush on Myrna Loy, 
and likes to rent her movies, for a treat. 
It makes some evenings harder to enjoy. 

The list of actresses who might employ 
him as their slave is too long to repeat. 
(My husband has a crush on Myrna Loy, 

Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, coy 
Jean Arthur with that voice as dry as wheat ...) 
It makes some evenings harder to enjoy. 

Does he confess all this just to annoy 
a loyal spouse? I know I can’t compete. 
My husband has a crush on Myrna Loy. 

And can’t a woman have her dreamboats? Boy, 
I wouldn’t say my life is incomplete, 
but some evening I could certainly enjoy 

two hours with Cary Grant as my own toy. 
I guess, though, we were destined not to meet. 
My husband has a crush on Myrna Loy, 
which makes some evenings harder to enjoy.

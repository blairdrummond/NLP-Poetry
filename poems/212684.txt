A Caledonian megalith. 
A tinted bather from Cape Ann.   
The 1937 kith 
and kin of a Kentuckian   
beside their Model T sedan. 
The Celts. Who set me this arith- 
metic of icons? Who began   
by pasting in Bob Dylan? Zith- 
erpicking rhinestone charlatan.   
He tries to be American. 

Who tries to be American 
as hard as him? Not Aly Khan.   
Not George F. Babbitt the Zenith- 
ophiliac Zenithian. 
As sure as God made Granny Smith   
a pricier-sounding product than   
the Winesap or the Jonathan,   
there is a mystery and myth   
to being an American, 
and being an American 

compounds it. Kurosawa-san,   
steady my Nikon while I pan   
across the porches of forsyth- 
iabedizened Mattapan 
in search of ... dot dot dot ... the plan,   
the weltanschauung, the ethnith- 
ifying principle a pith 
helmeted Oxbridge fancy-dan 
could pounce on like a fiend from Ran 
and authenticate forthwith. 

The cromlech beetles o’er the frith.   
The ultimate American 
possession rattles his Kal-Kan,   
Prince, you’re a prince. A dog a man   
can talk to. What this caravan   
of adumbrations and antith-   
esises panteth for is Dith 
Pran and the long-lost Mrs. Pran:   
Far-fetched, tenacious, captious: fan   
tabulously American.

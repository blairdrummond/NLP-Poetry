title : Auroras

author : Joanna Klink

text : 
It began in a foyer of evenings 
The evenings left traces of glass in the trees 
A book and a footpath we followed 
Under throat-pipes of birds

We moved through a room of leaves 
Thin streams of silver buried under our eyes 
A field of white clover buried under our eyes 
Or a river we stopped at to watch 
The wind cross it, recross it

Room into room you paused
Where once on a stoop we leaned back
Talking late into daylight
The morning trees shook off twilight
Opening and closing our eyes auroras

Beyond groves and flora we followed a road 
Dotted with polished brown bottles, 
Scoured furrows, a wood emptied of trees

It was enough to hollow us out
The evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet
Branches with spaces for winds

The earth changes
The way we speak to each other has changed 
As for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits 
Listening for a landscape beyond us

The Cold Heaven 
William Butler Yeats

Modern
Ireland
Religion, Death, Living



Suddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven 
That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,   
And thereupon imagination and heart were driven   
So wild that every casual thought of that and this 
Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season   
With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;   
And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,   
Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,   
Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,   
Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent   
Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken   
By the injustice of the skies for punishment?

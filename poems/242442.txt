 from incarceration, Taunton State Hospital, 1972
  
 gaunt, ugly deformed
  
 broken from the womb, and horribly shriven
 at the labor of their forefathers, if you check back
  
 scout around grey before actual time
 their sordid brains don’t work right,
 pinched men emaciated, piling up railroad ties and highway
 ditches
 blanched women, swollen and crudely numb
 ered before the dark of dawn
  
 scuttling by candlelight, one not to touch, that is, a signal panic
 thick peasants after the attitude
  
 at that time of their century, bleak and centrifugal
 they carry about them, tough disciplines of copper Indianheads.
  
 there are worse, whom you may never see, non-crucial around the
 spoke, these you do, seldom
 locked in Taunton State Hospital and other peon work farms
 drudge from morning until night, abandoned within destitute
 crevices odd clothes
 intent on performing some particular task long has been far
 removed
 there is no hope, they locked-in key’s; housed of course
  
 and there fed, poorly
 off sooted, plastic dishes, soiled grimy silver knives and forks,
 stamped Department of Mental Health spoons
 but the unshrinkable duties of any society
 produces its ill-kempt, ignorant and sore idiosyncrasies.
  
 There has never been a man yet, whom no matter how wise
 can explain how a god, so beautiful he can create
 the graces of formal gardens, the exquisite twilight sunsets
 in splendor of elegant toolsmiths, still can yield the horror of
  
 dwarfs, who cannot stand up straight with crushed skulls,
 diseases on their legs and feet unshaven faces of men and women,
 worn humped backs, deformed necks, hare lips, obese arms
 distended rumps, there is not a flame shoots out could ex-
 tinguish the torch of any liberty’s state infection.
  
 1907, My Mother was born, I am witness t-
 o the exasperation of gallant human beings at g-
 od, priestly fathers and Her Highness, Holy Mother the Church
 persons who felt they were never given a chance, had n-
 o luck and were flayed at suffering.
  
 They produced children with phobias, manias and depression,
 they cared little for their own metier, and kept watch upon
 others, some chance to get ahead
  
 Yes life was hard for them, much more hard than for any blo
 ated millionaire, who still lives on
 their hard-earned monies. I feel I shall
 have to be punished for writing this,
 that the omniscient god is the rich one,
 cared little for looks, less for Art,
 still kept weekly films close for the
 free dishes and scandal hot. Some how
 though got cheated in health and upon
 hearth. I am one of them. I am witness
 not to Whitman’s vision, but instead the 
 poorhouses, the mad city asylums and re-
 life worklines. Yes, I am witness not to 
 God’s goodness, but his better or less scorn.

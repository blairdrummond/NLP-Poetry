            I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there’s not enough            troops in the army to force the southern people to break            down segregation and accept the Negro [pronounced Nigra]            into our theatres, into our swimming pools, into our homes,            and into our churches.                                    —Strom Thurmond, South Carolina                                    Senator and Presidential Candidate                                         for the States’ Rights Party, 1948             I said, “I’m gonna fight Thurmond from the mountain to            the sea.”                                     —Modjeska Monteith Simkins, Civil                              Rights Matriarch, South Carolina, 1948
The youngest has been married off.
  
 He is as tall as Abraham Lincoln. Here, on his
 wedding day, he flaunts the high spinning laugh
 of a newly freed slave. I stand above him, just
 off the second-floor landing, watching
 the celebration unfold.
  
 Uncle-cousins, bosom buddies, convertible cars
 of nosy paramours, strolling churlish penny-
 pinchers pour onto the mansion estate. Below,
 Strom Thurmond is dancing with my mother.
  
 The favorite son of South Carolina has already
 danced with the giddy bride and the giddy bride’s
 mother. More women await: Easter dressy,
 drenched in caramel, double exposed, triple cinched,
 lined up, leggy, ready.
  
 I refuse to leave the porch.
  
 If I walk down I imagine he will extend his
 hand, assume I am next in his happy darky line,
 #427 on his dance card. His history
 and mine, burnt cork and blackboard chalk,
 concentric, pancaked, one face, two histories,
 slow dragging, doing the nasty.
  
 My father knows all this.
  
 Daddy’s Black Chief Justice legs straddle the boilerplate
 carapace of the CSS H. L. Hunley, lost Confederate
 submarine, soon to be found just off the coast of
 Charleston. He keeps it fully submerged by
 applying the weight of every treatise he has
 ever written against the death penalty of
 South Carolina. Chanting “Briggs v. Elliott,”
 he keeps the ironside door of the submarine shut.
 No hands.
  
 His eyes are a Black father’s beacon, search-
 lights blazing for the married-off sons, and
 on the unmarried, whale-eyed nose-in-book
 daughter, born unmoored, quiet, yellow,
 strategically placed under hospital lights to
 fully bake. The one with the most to lose.
  
 There will be no trouble. Still, he chain-
 smokes. A burning stick of mint & Indian
 leaf seesaws between his lips. He wants
 me to remember that trouble is a fire that
 runs like a staircase up then down. Even
 on a beautiful day in June.
  
 I remember the new research just out:
 What the Negro gave America
 Chapter 9,206:
  
 Enslaved Africans gifted porches to North
 America. Once off the boats they were told,
 then made, to build themselves a place—to live.
  
 They build the house that will keep them alive.
  
 Rather than be the bloody human floret on
 yet another southern tree, they imagine higher
 ground. They build landings with floor enough
 to see the trouble coming. Their arced imaginations
 nail the necessary out into the floral air. On the
 backs and fronts of twentypenny houses,
 a watching place is made for the ones who will
 come tipping with torch & hog tie through the
 quiet woods, hoping to hang them as decoration
 in the porcupine hair of longleaf.
  
 The architecture of Black people is sui generis.
 This is architecture dreamed by the enslaved:
  
 Their design will be stolen.
 Their wits will outlast gold.
 My eyes seek historical rest from the kiss-
 kiss theater below; Strom Thurmond’s
 it’s-never-too-late-to-forgive-me chivaree.
 I search the tops of yellow pine while my
 fingers reach, catch, pinch my father’s
 determined-to-rise smoke.
  
 Long before AC African people did the
 math: how to cool down the hot air of
 South Carolina?
  
 If I could descend, without being trotted
 out by some roughrider driven by his
 submarine dreams, this is what I’d take
 my time and scribble into the three-tiered,
 white créme wedding cake:
  
 Filibuster. States’ Rights. The Grand Inquisition
 of the great Thurgood Marshall. This wedding
 reception would not have been possible without
 the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (opposed by
 you-know-who).
  
 The Dixiecrat senator has not worn his
 sandy seersucker fedora to the vows.
 The top of Strom Thurmond’s bald head
 reveals a birthmark tattooed in contrapposto
 pose: Segregation Forever.
  
 All my life he has been the face of hatred;
 the blue eyes of the Confederate flag,
 the pasty bald of white men pulling wooly
 heads up into the dark skirts of trees,
 the sharp, slobbering, amber teeth of
 German shepherds, still clenched inside
 the tissue-thin, (still marching), band-leader
 legs of Black schoolteachers, the single-
 minded pupae growing between the legs of
 white boys crossing the tracks, ready to
 force Black girls into fifth-grade positions,
 Palmetto state-sanctioned sex 101.
  
 I didn’t want to dance with him.
  
 My young cousin arrives at my elbow.
 Her beautiful lips the color of soft-skin
 mangoes. She pulls, teasing the stitches
 of my satin bridesmaid gown, “You better
 go on down there and dance with Strom—
 while he still has something left.”
  
 I don’t tell her it is unsouthern for her
 to call him by his first name, as if they
 are familiar. I don’t tell her: To bear
 witness to marriage is to believe that
 everything moving through the sweet
 wedding air can be confidently, left—
 to Love.
  
 I stand on the landing high above the
 beginnings of Love, holding a plastic
 champagne flute, drinking in the warm
 June air of South Carolina. I hear my 
 youngest brother’s top hat joy. Looking
 down I find him, deep in the giddy crowd,
 modern, integrated, interpretive.
  
 For ten seconds I consider dancing with
 Strom. His Confederate hands touch
 every shoulder, finger, back that I love.
 I listen to the sound of Black laughter
 shimmying. All worry floats beyond
 the gurgling submarine bubbles,
 the white railing, every drop of 
 champagne air.
  
 I close my eyes and Uncle Freddie
 appears out of a baby’s breath of fog.
 (The dead are never porch bound.)
 He moves with ease where I cannot. 
 He walks out on the rice-thrown air,
 heaving a lightning bolt instead of
 a wave. Suddenly, there is a table set,
 complete with 1963 dining room stars,
 they twinkle twinkle up & behind him.
 Thelonious, Martin, Malcolm, Nina,
 Dakota, all mouths Negro wide &
 open have come to sing me down.
 His tattered almanac sleeps curled like
 a wintering slug in his back pocket.
 His dark Dogon eyes jet to the scene
 below, then zoom past me until they are
 lost in the waning sugilite sky. Turning
 in the shadows of the wheat fields,
 he whispers a truth plucked from
 the foreword tucked in his back pocket:
 Veritas: Black people will forgive you
 quicker than you can say Orangeburg
 Massacre.
  
 History does not keep books on the
 handiwork of slaves. But the enslaved
 who built this Big House, long before
 I arrived for this big wedding, knew
 the power of a porch.
  
 This native necessity of nailing down
 a place, for the cooling off of air,
 in order to lift the friendly, the kindly,
 the so politely, the in-love-ly, jubilant,
 into the arms of the grand peculiar,
 for the greater good of
 the public spectacular:
  
 us 
 giving us
 away.

title : Pastime with Good Company

author : Henry VIII, king of England

text : 
Pastime with good company 
I love and shall unto I die. 
Grudge whoso will, but none deny, 
So God be pleased, this live will I. 
For my pastance 
Hunt, sing, and dance. 
My heart is set 
All godely sport 
To my comfort. 
Who shall me let? 

Youth will have needs daliance, 
Of good or ill some pastance. 
Company me thinketh then best 
All thoftes and fantasies to digest. 
For idleness 
Is chief mistress 
Of vices all. 
Than who can say 
But “pass the day” 
Is best of all? 

Company with honesty 
Is virtue, and vice to flee. 
Company is good or ill 
But every man hath his free will. 
The best ensue, 
The worst eschew, 
My mind shall be. 
Virtue to use, 
Vice to refuse, 
I shall use me.

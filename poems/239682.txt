title : My Hometown

author : Donal Heffernan

text : 
Oh, Homer! 
Your village sleeps near the Missouri River 
With your cousin Winnebago, both children of Lakotaland. 
You kept your town at two stories, as flat as the surrounding prairie. 
You taught the Iliad and Odyssey in honor of your namesake poet. 
Your spirit outlasted the bleached fields of the Depression, and 
Bravely swam against the raging Omaha Creek floods. 
On warm, wet spring Saturday nights, 
You provided dark places for your young 
To launch your next generation 
In pickups, unlighted.

Rhymed Stanza

I feel the spring far off, far off,
    The faint, far scent of bud and leaf--
 Oh, how can spring take heart to come
    To a world in grief,
    Deep grief?
  
 The sun turns north, the days grow long,
    Later the evening star grows bright--
 How can the daylight linger on
    For men to fight,
    Still fight?
  
 The grass is waking in the ground,
    Soon it will rise and blow in waves--
 How can it have the heart to sway
    Over the graves,
    New graves?
  
 Under the boughs where lovers walked
    The apple-blooms will shed their breath--
 But what of all the lovers now
    Parted by Death,
    Grey Death?

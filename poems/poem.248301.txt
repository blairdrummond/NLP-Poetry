                                      I 
Happy are men who yet before they are killed 
Can let their veins run cold. 
Whom no compassion fleers 
Or makes their feet 
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers. 
The front line withers. 
But they are troops who fade, not flowers, 
For poets' tearful fooling: 
Men, gaps for filling: 
Losses, who might have fought 
Longer; but no one bothers. 

                                     II 
And some cease feeling 
Even themselves or for themselves. 
Dullness best solves 
The tease and doubt of shelling, 
And Chance's strange arithmetic 
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling. 
They keep no check on armies' decimation. 

                                     III 
Happy are these who lose imagination: 
They have enough to carry with ammunition. 
Their spirit drags no pack. 
Their old wounds, save with cold, can not more ache. 
Having seen all things red, 
Their eyes are rid 
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever. 
And terror's first constriction over, 
Their hearts remain small-drawn. 
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle 
Now long since ironed, 
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned. 

                                     IV 
Happy the soldier home, with not a notion 
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack, 
And many sighs are drained. 
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained: 
His days are worth forgetting more than not. 
He sings along the march 
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk, 
The long, forlorn, relentless trend 
From larger day to huger night. 

                                     V 
We wise, who with a thought besmirch 
Blood over all our soul, 
How should we see our task 
But through his blunt and lashless eyes? 
Alive, he is not vital overmuch; 
Dying, not mortal overmuch; 
Nor sad, nor proud, 
Nor curious at all. 
He cannot tell 
Old men's placidity from his. 

                                     VI 
But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns, 
That they should be as stones. 
Wretched are they, and mean 
With paucity that never was simplicity. 
By choice they made themselves immune 
To pity and whatever moans in man 
Before the last sea and the hapless stars; 
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores; 
Whatever shares 
The eternal reciprocity of tears.

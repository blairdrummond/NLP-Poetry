What are aesthetic values and why do 
there appear to be lesser & fewer of 
them? Quick: define the difference 
between arpeggio & Armani. The baby 
cries because the baby likes crying. 
The baby cries because a pin is 
sticking into the baby. The baby 
is not crying but it is called 
crying. Who’s on first, what’s 
shortstop. The man the man declined 
to be, appraised at auction at 
eighty percent of surface volume. 
Cube steak on rye amusing twist 
on lay demo cells, absolutely no 
returns. Damaged goods are the only 
kind of goods I ever cared about. 
The lacuna misplaced the ladle, 
the actor aborted the fable. Fold 
your caps into Indians & 
flaps. Dusting the rigor mortis 
for compos mentis. Rune is busting 
out all over—perfidious quarrel 
sublates even the heckling at 
the Ponderosa. A bevy of belts. 
Burl Ives turned to burlap. Who 
yelled that? Lily by the lacquer 
(laparotomy). I’m here strictly on 
business, literary business. May 
I propose the codicil-ready cables? 
Like slips gassing in the night. 
Chorus of automatic exclusions.
Don't give me no label as long as I 
am able. Search & displace, curse 
& disgrace. Suppose you suppose, 
circumstances remonstrating. Crest 
envy. Don’t give me the Bronx 
when you mean the Bronx. This 
one thing I know for she loathes 
me so: Ketchup will pass for blood 
only under highly limited conditions. 
I had a red ball / I watched it 
fall. Help me so that I may exist 
again. It’s the billyclub not the 
Billy that needs watching. Keep 
your eye on the balloon (cartoon)! 
Budge, but then move back into 
position. In other words, steal 
my car but don’t steal my sister’s 
hood. Ironclad comeuppance. Breakfast 
at the Eiffel tower, lunch at the 
Kremlin, dinner at the Taj Mahal. 
In other words, hurt me 
but don’t hurt me so bad. 
May flies / So June can hold 
July. That’s no arrow that’s a 
diversionary tactic. That’s no 
spastic that’s my elocutionary 
lodge. When all the cares 
have become little tiny porous 
creatures, buckling under the weight 
of the remorse. The barfly butters 
his bread on all sides of the 
collective agency, while even at home 
the Colonel takes out the garbage. 
You will find a moist towelette 
with your porridge. Then just say so. 
Cratylus, Cratylus, wilt thou be   
mine?  As I is the starch from 
yesterday’s yawning. Cure me 
so that I will smoke yet not be 
consumed (at least not at a 
discount). Pools rush in 
where barriers have not been 
fortified. Rule rules 
where furriers redesign. “Amish 
modern.” French poetry is looking 
for a way out of “French poetry.” 
Ne touchez pas cette button. The 
color of baloney. WWW.TheSirens.Org. 
Ne touchez pas ma bologna. Her 
hair was auburn her eyes like amber. 
Honest to gosh gullies: arraignment 
of a power untapped & untappable. 
Quittez votre place (Kitaj dislikes 
his place). Emboss my fiduciary 
capitulations! The bellicose churning 
of the unsettled stomach. National 
Geographic’s “Robot” issue: 
The Wilderness of the Future, e.g., 
the Gates Robot Preserve, the 
American Robotic Conservancy, 
the Fund for Robotic Culture, 
the National Endowment for Robots 
(a.k.a. U.S. Congress). Millions 
for automation but not one cent 
for elegy. Eight elephants dancing 
deliriously to the wail of the   
bumble bees. So long, sailor / 
goodbye failure. Or let the pail 
wear the head of the lotion. Here 
is smoldering continuation. The 
smell of green tea on Greene Street. 
Bottled reticence. Gimme gimme 
gone. Guilt in the form of guilt. 
         “& even then my heart was aching 
         For I am yours, just for the taking...”

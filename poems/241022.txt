 The clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds
 assembled in light of earliest birds, an originary
 text over water over time, and that without which
  
 the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds
 implicit in the air where the clouds had been
 recently witnessed rehearsing departure, a heartfelt phrase
  
 in the push of the airborne drops and crystals
 over water over time—how being made to think
 oneself an obstruction between the observer
  
 and the object or objects under surveillance or even
 desired—or if I am felt to be beside the point
 then I have wanted that, but to block a path is like
  
 not being immaterial enough, or being too much
 when all they want from you now is your station
 cleared of its personal effects please and vanish—
  
 not that they’d ever just come out and say it when
 all that darting around of the eyes, all that shaky
 camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the
  
 end of your tenure at this organization, and remember
 a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming
 accidence landed one here to begin with, didn’t it.

 The clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds
 viewed from the midst of human speculation, a business
 project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain
  
 control of the formation and movement of clouds.
 As late afternoons I have witnessed the distant
 towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun, in-box
  
 empty, surround sound on, all my money made
 in lieu of conversation—where conversation indicates
 the presence of desire in the parties to embark on
  
 exchange of spirit, hours forzando with heartfelt phrase—
 made metaphor for it, the face on the clock tower
 bright as a meteor, as if a torch were held against
  
 likelihood to illuminate the time so I could watch
 the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury
 appointments of my office suite, the tumult below
  
 or behind me out of mind, had not my whole attention
 been riveted by the human figure stood upon
 the tower’s topmost pinnacle, himself surveying 
  
 the clouds of the future parting in antiquity, a figure
 not to be mistaken, tranquilly pacing a platform
 with authority: the chief executive officer of clouds.

 The clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds
 built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces
 which, prior to the factories’ recent construction,
  
 provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons,
 a species revered in ancient Egypt as attendants
 of Thoth, god of wisdom, science, and measurement.
  
 Fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts
 can be heard from up to a mile away, depending on
 air temperature, humidity, the absence or presence
  
 of any competing sound, its origin and its character.
 It is no more impossible to grasp the baboon’s 
 full significance in Egyptian religious symbolism
  
 than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture
 provoke in an audience more positive, lasting
 response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature.
  
 Even those who consider natural clouds products
 of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely
 human mind lie behind the products they admire.
  
 This development may be a form of self-exalting
 or else another adaptation in order that we find
 the hum of machinery comforting through darkness.

 The clouds part revealing there’s no place left to sit
 myself down except for a single wingback chair
 backed into a corner to face the window in which
  
 the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds
 cavorting over the backs of the people in the field
 who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves,
  
 who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails,
 who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it,
 who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently
  
 palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off
 the chaff as the grain falls to the floor, who collect
 the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it
  
 into flour, who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer
 in the sanctuary, its walls washed white like milk.
 To perform it repeatedly, to perform it each time
  
 as if the first, to walk the dim corridor believing that 
 the conference it leads to might change everything,
 to adhere to a possibility of reward, of betterment,
  
 of moving above, with effort, the condition into which
 one has been born, to whom do I owe the pleasure
 of the hum to which I have been listening too long.

 The clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds,
 believers in people, ideas and things, the workers
 of the united fields of clouds, supporters of the wars
  
 to keep clouds safe, the devotees of heartfelt phrase
 and belief you can change with water over time.
 It is the habit of a settled population to give ear to
  
 whatever is desirable will come to pass, a caressing
 confidence—but one unfortunately not borne out
 by human experience, for most things people desire
  
 have been desired ardently for thousands of years
 and observe—they are no closer to realization today
 than in Ramses’ time. Nor is there cause to believe
  
 they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow.
 Attempts to speed them on have been undertaken
 from the beginning; plans to force them overnight
  
 are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet
 they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are
 they will continue to elude us until the clouds part
  
 in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork—
 but when the clouds start to knit back together again,
 we’ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission.

 The clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies
 united into one immaterial body, a fictive person
 around whom the air is blurred with money, force
  
 from which much harm will come, to whom my welfare
 matters nothing. I sense without turning the light
 from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves
  
 on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet
 vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way.
 If I turn around, the room might not be full of wings
  
 capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being,
 which is to say that I myself may be the source of
 what I sense, but am no less powerless to change it.
  
 Always around me, on my body, in my mouth, I fear them
 and their love of money, everything I do without
 thinking to help them make it. And if I am felt to be
  
 beside the point, I have wanted that, to live apart
 from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep
 itself alive, and yet not happily, with all its needs
  
 and comforts met, but fattened so far past that point
 I am engrossed, and if I picture myself outside of it
 it isn’t me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable.

 The clouds part revealing the distinction between
 words without meaning and meaning without words,
 a phenomenon of nature, the westbound field
  
 of low air pressure developing over water over time
 and warm, saturated air on the sea surface rising 
 steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle
  
 repeating, the warm moving upward into massive
 thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye
 around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter-
  
 clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric
 pressure dropping even further, making winds
 accelerate, the clouds revolve, a confusion of energy,
  
 an incomprehensible volume of rain—I remember
 the trick of thinking through infinity, a crowd of eyes
 against an asphalt wall, my vision of it scrolling
  
 left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then
 just black until I fall asleep and then just black again,
 past marketing, past focus groups, past human
  
 resources, past management, past personal effects,
 their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream
 and through much of the debriefing I wake into next.

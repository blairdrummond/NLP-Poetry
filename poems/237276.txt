title : From the Plane

author : Anne Marie Macari

text : 
It is a soft thing, it has been sifted   
from the sieve of space and seems   
asleep there under the moths of light.   

Cluster of dust and fire, from up here   
you are a stranger and I am dropping   
through the funnel of air to meet you.

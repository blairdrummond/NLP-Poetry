January 

Contorted by wind,
mere armatures for ice or snow,
the trees resolve
to endure for now,

they will leaf out in April.
And I must be as patient
as the trees—
a winter resolution

I break all over again,
as the cold presses
its sharp blade 
against my throat.


February 

After endless
hibernation
on the windowsill,
the orchid blooms—

embroidered purple stitches
up and down
a slender stem.
Outside, snow

melts midair
to rain.
Abbreviated month.
Every kind of weather.


March 

When the Earl King came
to steal away the child
in Goethe’s poem, the father said
don’t be afraid,

it’s just the wind. . .
As if it weren’t the wind
that blows away the tender
fragments of this world—

leftover leaves in the corners
of the garden, a Lenten Rose
that thought it safe
to bloom so early.


April 

In the pastel blur
of the garden, 
the cherry 
and redbud

shake rain
from their delicate
shoulders, as petals
of pink

dogwood
wash down the ditches
in dreamlike
rivers of color.


May 

May apple, daffodil,
hyacinth, lily,
and by the front
porch steps

every billowing
shade of purple
and lavender lilac,
my mother’s favorite flower,

sweet breath drifting through
the open windows:
perfume of memory—conduit
of spring.


June 

The June bug
on the screen door
whirs like a small,
ugly machine,

and a chorus of frogs
and crickets drones like Musak
at all the windows.
What we don’t quite see

comforts us.
Blink of lightning, grumble
of thunder—just the heat
clearing its throat.


July 

Tonight the fireflies
light their brief
candles
in all the trees

of summer—
color of moonflakes,
color of fluorescent
lace

where the ocean drags
its torn hem
over the dark
sand.


August 

Barefoot 
and sun-dazed, 
I bite into this ripe peach
of a month,

gathering children
into my arms
in all their sandy
glory,

heaping
my table each night
with nothing
but corn and tomatoes.


September 

Their summer romance 
over, the lovers 
still cling 
to each other 

the way the green 
leaves cling 
to their trees 
in the strange heat 

of September, as if 
this time 
there will be 
no autumn. 


October 

How suddenly 
the woods 
have turned 
again. I feel 

like Daphne, standing 
with my arms 
outstretched 
to the season, 

overtaken 
by color, crowned 
with the hammered gold 
of leaves. 


November  

These anonymous 
leaves, their wet 
bodies pressed 
against the window 

or falling past— 
I count them 
in my sleep, 
absolving gravity, 

absolving even death 
who knows as I do 
the imperatives 
of the season. 


December 

The white dove of winter 
sheds its first 
fine feathers; 
they melt 

as they touch 
the warm ground 
like notes 
of a once familiar 

music; the earth 
shivers and 
turns towards 
the solstice.

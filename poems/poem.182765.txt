Sonnet

An inland sea - blue as a sapphire - set
   Within a sparkling, emerald mountain chain 
   Where day and night fir-needles sift like rain 
Thro' the voluptuous air. The soft winds fret 
The waves, and beat them wantonly to foam. 
   The golden distances across the sea 
   Are shot with rose and purple. Languorously 
The silver seabirds in wide circles roam. 
The sun drops slowly down the flaming West 
   And flings its rays across to set aglow 
   The islands rocking on the cool waves' crest 
And the great glistening domes of snow on snow. 
   And thro' the mist the Olympics flash and float 
   Like opals linked around a beating throat.

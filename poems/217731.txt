title : Little Blessing for My Floater

author : Jeanne Murray Walker

text : 
After George Herbert 
This tiny ruin in my eye, small 
flaw in the fabric, little speck 
of blood in the egg, deep chip 
in the windshield, north star, 
polestar, floater that doesn't 
float, spot where my hand is not, 
even when I'm looking at my hand, 
little piton that nails every rock 
I see, no matter if the picture 
turns to sand, or sand to sea, 
I embrace you, piece of absence 
that reminds me what I will be, 
all dark some day unless God 
rescues me, oh speck 
that might teach me yet to see.

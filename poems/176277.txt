title : At Noon

author : Reginald Gibbons

text : 
The thick-walled room’s cave-darkness, 
cool in summer, soothes 
by saying, This is the truth, not the taut   
cicada-strummed daylight. 
Rest here, out of the flame—the thick air’s 
stirred by the fan’s four 
slow-moving spoons; under the house the stone 
has its feet in deep water. 
Outside, even the sun god, dressed in this life 
as a lizard, abruptly rises 
on stiff legs and descends blasé toward the shadows.

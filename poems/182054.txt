text : 
You’re expected to see   
only the top, where sky   
scrambles bloom, and not   
the spindly leg, hairy, fending off   
tall, green darkness beneath.   
Like every flower, she has a little   
theory, and what she thinks   
is up.   I imagine the long   
climb out of the dark   
beyond morning glories, day lilies, four o’clocks   
up there to the dream she keeps   
lifting, where it’s noon all day.

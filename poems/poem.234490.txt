Love, Heartache & Loss, Realistic & Complicated



When last we parted, thou wert young and fair,
    How beautiful let fond remembrance say!
    Alas! since then old time has stolen away
Full thirty years, leaving my temples bare.--
So has it perished like a thing of air,
    The dream of love and youth!-- now both are grey
    Yet still remembering that delightful day,
Though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair,
    Though I have suffered many years of pain
Since then, though I did never think to live
    To hear that voice or see those eyes again,
I can a sad but cordial greeting give,
And for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer--
As when I loved thee young and fair.

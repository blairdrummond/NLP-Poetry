title : An Emeritus Addresses the School

author : John Ciardi

No one can wish nothing. 
Even that death wish sophomores   
are nouveau-glib about 
reaches for a change of notice. 

“I’ll have you know,” it will say   
thirty years later to its son, 
“I was once widely recognized 
for the quality of my death wish.” 

That was before three years   
of navel-reading with a guru   
who reluctantly concluded   
some souls are bank tellers; 

perhaps more than one would think   
at the altitude of Intro. Psych.,   
or turned on to a first raga, 
or joining Polyglots Anonymous. 

One trouble with this year’s   
avant-garde is that it has already   
taken it fifty years to be behind   
the avant-garde of the twenties 

with the Crash yet to come.   
And even free souls buy wives,   
fall in love with automobiles,   
and marry a mortgage. 

At fifty, semisustained by bourbon,   
you wonder what the kids see   
in that Galactic Twang 
they dance the Cosmic Konk to. 

You will have forgotten such energy,   
its illusion of violent freedoms.   
You must suffer memory 
to understanding in the blare 

of a music that tires you. 
There does come a death wish,   
but you will be trapped by your   
begetting, love what you have given, 

be left waiting in a noise 
for the word that must be whispered. 
No one can wish nothing. You can 
learn to wish for so little 

a word might turn you 
all the bent ways to love, its mercies   
practiced, its one day at a time 
begun and lived and slept on and begun.

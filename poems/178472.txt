title : The Finality of a Poem

author : Michael Anania

text : 
(after Albert Cook) 
All day, that   
is forever, 

they fall, leaves,   
pine needles, 

as blindly as   
hours into hours 

colliding,   
and the chill 

rain—what else   
do you expect 

of October?— 
spilling from one 

roof to another,   
like words from 

lips to lips, your   
long incertain 

say in all of this   
unsure of where 

the camera is 
and how the light 

is placed and what   
it is that’s ending.

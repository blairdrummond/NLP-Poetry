O Donald! Ye Are Just the Man

Love, First Love, Realistic & Complicated



O Donald! ye are just the man
   Who, when he's got a wife,
Begins to fratch-- nae notice ta'en--
   They're strangers a' their life.

The fan may drop-- she takes it up,
   The husband keeps his chair;
She hands the kettle-- gives his cup--
   Without e'en-- thank ye, dear."

Now, truly, these slights are but toys;
   But frae neglects like these,
The wife may soon a slattern grow,
   And strive nae mair to please.

For wooers ay do all they can
   To trifle wi' the mind;
They hold the blaze of beauty up,
   And keep the poor things blind.

But wedlock tears away the veil,
   The goddess is nae mair;
He thinks his wife a silly thing,
   She thinks her man a bear.

Let then the lover be the friend--
   The loving friend for life;
Think but thysel the happiest spouse,
   She'll be the happiest wife.

title : The Bad Mother

author : Susan Griffin

text : 
The bad mother wakes from dreams 
of imperfection trying to be perfection. 
All night she’s engineered a train 
too heavy with supplies 
to the interior. She fails. 
The child she loves 
has taken on bad habits, cigarettes 
maybe even drugs. She 
recognizes lies. You don’t 
fool me, she wants to say, 
the bad mother, ready to play 
and win. 
This lamb who’s gone – 
this infant she is 
pinioned to – does not listen, 
she drives with all her magic down a 
different route to darkness where 
all life begins.

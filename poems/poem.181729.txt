I 
The bartender 
Has eyes the color of ripe apricots 
Easy to please as a cash register he 
Enjoys art and good jokes. 
Squish 
Goes the painting 
Squirt 
Goes the poem 
He 
We 
Laugh. 

II 
It is not easy to remember that other people died 
          besides Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker 
Died looking for beauty in the world of the 
          bartender 
This person, that person, this person, that person 
          died looking for beauty 
Even the bartender died 

III   
Dante blew his nose 
And his nose came off in his hand 
Rimbaud broke his throat 
Trying to cough 
Dada is not funny 
It is a serious assault 
On art 
Because art 
Can be enjoyed by the bartender. 

IV 
The bartender is not the United States 
Or the intellectual 
Or the bartender 
He is every bastard that does not cry 
When he reads this poem.

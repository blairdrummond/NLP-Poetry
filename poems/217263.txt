A reflection on my students
They are so beautiful, and so very young 
they seem almost to glitter with perfection, 
these creatures that I briefly move among. 

I never get to stay with them for long, 
but even so, I view them with affection: 
they are so beautiful, and so very young. 

Poised or clumsy, placid or high-strung, 
they're expert in the art of   introspection, 
these creatures that I briefly move among— 

And if their words don't quite trip   off the tongue 
consistently, with just the right inflection, 
they remain beautiful. And very young. 

Still, I have to tell myself it's   wrong 
to think of them as anything but fiction, 
these creatures that I briefly move   among— 

Because, like me, they're traveling   headlong 
in that familiar, vertical direction 
that coarsens beautiful, blackmails young— 
the two delusions we all move among.

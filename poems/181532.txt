title : Trauma (Storm)

author : Gregory Orr

text : 
Hunkered down, nerve-numb, 
in the carnal hut, 
the cave of self, 
while outside a storm 
rages. 
          Huddled there, 
rubbing together 
white sticks of 
your own ribs, 
praying for sparks 
in that dark 
where tinder is heart, 
where tender is not.

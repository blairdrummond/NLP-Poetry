Tell all the truth but tell it slant -- (1263) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Arts & Sciences, Philosophy



Tell all the truth but tell it slant --
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise
As Lightning to the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind --

And that’s how it is; everyone standing up from the big silence
  
 of the table with their glasses of certainty and plates of forgiveness
 and walking into the purple kitchen; everyone leaning away from the gas stove
  
 Marie blows on at the very edge of the breaking blue-orange-lunging-
  
 forward flames to warm another pot of coffee, while the dishes pile up in the sink,
 perfect as a pyramid. Aaah, says Donna, closing her eyes,
  
 and leaning on Nick’s shoulders as he drives the soft blade of the knife
  
 through the glittering dark of the leftover chocolate birthday cake.
 That’s it; that’s how it is; everyone standing around as if just out of the pool,
  
 drying off, standing around, that’s it, standing, talking,
  
 shuffling back and forth on the deck of the present
 before the boat slowly pulls away into the future. Because it hurts
  
 to say goodbye, to pull your body out of the warm water;
  
 to step out of the pocket of safety, clinging to what you knew,
 or what you thought you knew about yourself and others.
  
 That’s how it is, that’s it, throwing your jacket over your shoulders
  
 like a towel and saying goodbye Victoria goodbye Sophie goodbye
 Lili goodbye sweetie take care be well hang in there see you soon.

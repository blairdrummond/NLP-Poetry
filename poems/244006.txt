text : 
Just now I touched my chest
 And felt my heart quivering there.
 This must be one of the bad times.
  
 I think it is quivering with remorse
 And exhaustion. Once I saw a heart
 Beating in a documentary. I was a very
  
 Little girl and the sight disgusted me.
 Throbbing and not stopping my heart betrays
 Me and yet remains sure and true, a thing
  
 Of nature. Earth bleeding 
 Its guts out on the sea floor exhausts
 Me with remorse and shame, and yet I have to trust it
  
 As wealth is proven by how terribly it devastates
 Itself, and I am but one symptom among billions of the wealth
 Of Earth. A tired feeling that is recuperated by a passing spaceship
  
 Or an infinitude like fame but more universal. I will have to miss you
 Earth; I miss you already. And yet when I touch myself whom I should
 Not trust it is still only the heaviest and most jealous feelings that bind me to you, like blood.

Red-Wigglers, Night-Crawlers
 & Other Worms
 look out
 into the crapulous moonlight:
  
 figures of women cascading through the Sunday night;
  
 no beer in sight.
  
 I remember the Night-blooming
 Cereus by Dr. Thornton, Engraver, Blake’s
 patron, it
 hangs in the hall outside the bedroom
 swaying hungrily like these
 giant white goddesses of the dark grotto…
  
 there are touring cars
 and men with large guns
 singing through the woods
  
 behind us.

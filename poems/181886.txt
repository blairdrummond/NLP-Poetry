Our clothes are still wet from wading 
The Chickamunga last evening. 
There is heavy frost. We have 
Walked on the dead all night. 
Now in the firelight 
We are exchanging shells and grapeshot. 

I can still hear our loud huzzah 
When late in the day 
The enemy fell into full retreat 
Along the pine ridge to the east. . . 

We chased them until we were weary. 
Each night this week 
There’s been something 
To keep me from sleep. Just an hour ago 
I saw 

A dead sharpshooter sitting 
Against a rock with a scallop 
Of biscuit still lodged in his mouth. 
He wore one silk sock. 

Snedikerhas returned from Chattanooga 
With five thousand convalescents 
For the left wing of their musketry. 

We have roasted a deer 
With a molasses sauce and pepper. 
Magrill and zandt have returned 
From horse hunting with a sack of sugar. 

By morning we will have buried our dead 
And fed the prisoners: Joe Cotton 

Will hang all seven of them in one tree 
When he sees they’re done 
Licking their fingers. . . 

I shot a Rebel yesterday 
In high water just for cursing me. 
Just six months ago 
For that alone it would have meant 
Three days in stockade. 

We can see now that cannonading 
Has set the hillside on fire. 
The wounded Grays 
Will be burned 
Beyond their Christian names. . . 

Joe Cotton says he’d ask God 
For rain, but he’s got no tent 
And river water 
Has chilled him straight through 

To the very quick of his being.

—in borrowed language in honor and memory of Bill Ice
  
  
 Like a horse’s tail
 so thick, black
 down past his waist
 beautiful.    Wanyaka.
 Chemotherapy—
 white man’s
 man-made cancer . . . 
 doesn’t distinguish
 between good or bad
 cells . . . just kills.
 The spirit is connected 
 to the hair at the
 crown—pahin hocoka.
 The hair falls
 the spirit goes,
 the will is
 connected no more.
 Leukemia—
 cancer of the
 White 
 Blood Cell.

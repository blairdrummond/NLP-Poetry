title : Create Desire

Someone was searching for a Form of Fire.
 Bird-eyed, the wind watched.
 Four deer in a blowsy meadow.
 As though it were simply random, a stately stare.
  
 What’s six and six and two and ten?
 Time that my eye ached, my heart shook, why.
 Mistaking lime for lemon.
 Dressed in cobalt, charcoal, thistle—and control.
  
 If they had more they would need less.
 A proposal from the squinting logician.
 Seems we are legal, seems we are ill.
 Ponderous purpose, are you weather, are you wheel?
  
 Gold with a heart of cinder.
 Little blue chip dancing in the light of the loom.
 Mistress, May-girl, whom will you kiss?
 The death of water is the birth of air.

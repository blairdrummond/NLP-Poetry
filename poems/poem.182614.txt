Heard you that shriek? It rose 
   So wildly on the air, 
It seem'd as if a burden'd heart 
   Was breaking in despair. 

Saw you those hands so sadly clasped-- 
   The bowed and feeble head-- 
The shuddering of that fragile form-- 
   That look of grief and dread? 

Saw you the sad, imploring eye? 
   Its every glance was pain, 
As if a storm of agony 
   Were sweeping through the brain. 

She is a mother pale with fear, 
   Her boy clings to her side, 
And in her kyrtle vainly tries 
   His trembling form to hide. 

He is not hers, although she bore 
   For him a mother's pains; 
He is not hers, although her blood 
   Is coursing through his veins! 

He is not hers, for cruel hands 
   May rudely tear apart 
The only wreath of household love 
   That binds her breaking heart. 

His love has been a joyous light 
   That o'er her pathway smiled, 
A fountain gushing ever new, 
   Amid life's desert wild. 

His lightest word has been a tone 
   Of music round her heart, 
Their lives a streamlet blent in one-- 
   Oh, Father! must they part?

They tear him from her circling arms,
   Her last and fond embrace.
Oh! never more may her sad eyes
   Gaze on his mournful face.

No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks
   Disturb the listening air:
She is a mother, and her heart
   Is breaking in despair.

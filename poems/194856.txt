Muzzle and jowl and beastly brow, 
bilious glaring eyes, tufted ears, 
recidivous criminality in the slouch, 
—This is not the latest absconding bankrupt 
but a ‘beautiful’ tiger imported at great expense from   
Kuala Lumpur. 

7 photographers, 4 black-and-white artists and an R.A.   
are taking his profitable likeness;   
28 reporters and an essayist 
are writing him up. 
Sundry ladies think he is a darling   
especially at mealtimes, observing 
that a firm near the docks advertises replicas 
fullgrown on approval for easy cash payments. 

♂Felis Tigris (Straits Settlements) (Bobo) takes exercise   
up and down his cage before feeding 
in a stench of excrements of great cats 
indifferent to beauty or brutality. 
He is said to have eaten several persons 
but of course you can never be quite sure of these things.

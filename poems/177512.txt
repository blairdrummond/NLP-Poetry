text : 
I went back, as to my relatives.
When I arrived, the elms had been shaved. 
But you were all the same.
The buildings, the dry classrooms.
I embraced your eyes, your avenues. 
You were fixed in the same expressions. 
Your flat voices, your dental work,
like your lips, slipping over words already said. 
Additional agricultural pamphlets; 
many of you sat in private offices. 
Why did I think I could drag it all back, 
the former edge of town where 
streets ended in fields under clouds 
puffed like the French phrases 
he kissed me with in the sucked-in breath 
of that illusive happiness.
Coming back, listening, looking; 
ready to take your bodies in my hands. 
Returning to streets that had poured 
heavy shopping malls
over the hay-sweet grass
where he and I lay whispering 
the most important nonsense
of my desperate and embittered life.

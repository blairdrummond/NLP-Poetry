Performances, assortments, resumes-- 
Up Times Square to Columbus Circle lights 
Channel the congresses, nightly sessions, 
Refractions of the thousand theatres, faces-- 
Mysterious kitchens. . . . You shall search them all. 
Someday by heart you'll learn each famous sight 
And watch the curtain lift in hell's despite; 
You'll find the garden in the third act dead, 
Finger your knees--and wish yourself in bed 
With tabloid crime-sheets perched in easy sight. 

            Then let you reach your hat 
            and go. 
            As usual, let you--also 
            walking down--exclaim 
            to twelve upward leaving 
            a subscription praise 
            for what time slays. 

Or can't you quite make up your mind to ride; 
A walk is better underneath the L a brisk 
Ten blocks or so before? But you find yourself 
Preparing penguin flexions of the arms,-- 
As usual you will meet the scuttle yawn: 
The subway yawns the quickest promise home. 

Be minimum, then, to swim the hiving swarms 
Out of the Square, the Circle burning bright-- 
Avoid the glass doors gyring at your right, 
Where boxed alone a second, eyes take fright 
--Quite unprepared rush naked back to light: 
And down beside the turnstile press the coin 
Into the slot. The gongs already rattle. 
                
            And so 
            of cities you bespeak 
            subways, rivered under streets 
            and rivers. . . . In the car 
            the overtone of motion 
            underground, the monotone 
            of motion is the sound 
            of other faces, also underground-- 

"Let's have a pencil Jimmy--living now 
at Floral Park 
Flatbush--on the fourth of July-- 
like a pigeon's muddy dream--potatoes 
to dig in the field--travlin the town--too-- 
night after night--the Culver line--the 
girls all shaping up--it used to be--" 

Our tongues recant like beaten weather vanes. 
This answer lives like verdigris, like hair 
Beyond extinction, surcease of the bone; 
And repetition freezes--"What 

"what do you want? getting weak on the links? 
fandaddle daddy don't ask for change--IS THIS

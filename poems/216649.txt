text : 
I happen in 
from another unremarkable 
Tuesday in the realm 
of gratuitous sound, but here, 
I can hear again 
the quiet voices of the ontological, 
the clink of ice cubes 
in uplifted glasses, 
the scrape of chairs, 
the mournful lowing of floorboards, 
the long history of blood 
retold in my ears. 

I scuffle to the bar, thoughts 
drowned 
by my suddenly thunderous 
presence in this world, 
and the silence flowing 
from the neon jukebox, 
the silence going down 
smooth as the shot 
of loneliness that would 
naturally follow 
a Billie Holiday song 
if one were playing— 

—while everywhere hands 
are fluttering like sheets 
in winds of gossip, 
hollering above last call 
for one more round.

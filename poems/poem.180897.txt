Marriage 
Mary Elizabeth Coleridge 
1861-1907
Victorian
England
Love, Realistic & Complicated



No more alone sleeping, no more alone waking,
   Thy dreams divided, thy prayers in twain;
Thy merry sisters tonight forsaking,
   Never shall we see, maiden, again.

Never shall we see thee, thine eyes glancing.
   Flashing with laughter and wild in glee,
Under the mistletoe kissing and dancing,
   Wantonly free.

There shall come a matron walking sedately,
    Low-voiced, gentle, wise in reply.
Tell me, O tell me, can I love her greatly?
   All for her sake must the maiden die!

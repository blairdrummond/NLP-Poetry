Guy calls the doctor, says the wife’s   
contractions are five minutes apart.   
Doctor says, Is this her first child? 
guy says, No, it’s her husband. 

I promise to try to remember who   
I am. Wife gets up on one elbow, 

says, I wanted to get married.   
It seemed a fulfillment of some 

several things, a thing to be done.   
Even the diamond ring was some 

thing like a quest, a thing they   
set you out to get and how insane 

the quest is; how you have to turn   
it every way before you can even 

think to seek it; this metaphysical   
refraining is in fact the quest. Who’d 

have guessed? She sighs, I like   
the predictability of two, I like 

my pleasures fully expected,   
when the expectation of them 

grows patterned in its steady   
surprise. I’ve got my sweet 

and tumble pat. Here on earth,   
I like to count upon a thing 

like that. Thus explained   
the woman in contractions 

to her lover holding on 
the telephone for the doctor 

to recover from this strange   
conversational turn. You say 

you’re whom? It is a pleasure   
to meet you. She rolls her 

eyes, but he’d once asked her   
Am I your first lover? and she’d   
said, Could be. Your face looks   
familiar. It’s the same type of 

generative error. The grammar 
of the spoken word will flip, let alone 

the written, until something new is   
in us, and in our conversation.

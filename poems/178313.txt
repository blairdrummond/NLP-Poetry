title : The Others

text : 
They slept and ate like us. 
Feral they were not. 
The intricacy of their handiwork   
bespoke a fineness we’d be taught. 

Yet we wiped them out. 
It was eerily easy to do, 
although they knew we were coming   
and knew we knew they knew. 

Not only did they not resist 
our guns like bloody hacking coughs   
in their libraries and hospitals,   
their bedrooms and their schools— 

they would not acknowledge us. 
We felt like fools. There was no keening.   
Even the children did not cry. 
It was as if meaning 

inhered so deeply in their daily   
lives we could not touch it; 
nor would they quit living to be   
slaughtered, it was so inviolate.

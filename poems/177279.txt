title : On Teaching the Young

author : Yvor Winters

text : 
The young are quick of speech. 
Grown middle-aged, I teach 
Corrosion and distrust,
Exacting what I must.

A poem is what stands 
When imperceptive hands, 
Feeling, have gone astray. 
It is what one should say.

Few minds will come to this. 
The poet’s only bliss
Is in cold certitude
Laurel, archaic, rude.

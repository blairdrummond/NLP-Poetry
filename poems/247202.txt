title : Self Portrait

author : Cynthia Cruz

text : 
I did not want my body 
Spackled in the world’s 
Black beads and broke 
Diamonds. What the world

Wanted, I did not. Of the things 
It wanted. The body of Sunday 
Morning, the warm wine and 
The blood. The dripping fox

Furs dragged through the black New 
York snow—the parked car, the pearls, 
To the first pew—the funders, 
The trustees, the bloat, the red weight of

The world. Their faces. I wanted not 
That. I wanted Saint Francis, the love of 
His animals. The wolf, broken and bleeding— 
That was me.

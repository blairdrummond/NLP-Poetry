Rhymed Stanza, Series/Sequence

When on my bed the moonlight falls, 
         I know that in thy place of rest 
         By that broad water of the west, 
There comes a glory on the walls: 

Thy marble bright in dark appears, 
         As slowly steals a silver flame 
         Along the letters of thy name, 
And o'er the number of thy years. 

The mystic glory swims away; 
         From off my bed the moonlight dies; 
         And closing eaves of wearied eyes 
I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray: 

And then I know the mist is drawn 
         A lucid veil from coast to coast, 
         And in the dark church like a ghost 
Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.

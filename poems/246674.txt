title : After Suicide [In the hallway of life]

author : Matt Rasmussen

text : 
In the hallway of life
you were a rose with no stem 

and I, the janitor sweeping 
away the fallen petals.

You said the world revolves 
while we ourselves remain

in the darkness of the never-
ending, never-beginning never.

I say that the man who
was humiliated in the second act

and shot himself in the fifth, 
stands up, smiles, bows.

The lamp asks,
is it the shadow writing this,

the pen, or their converging? 
The paper asks nothing.

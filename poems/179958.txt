title : Briefly It Enters, Briefly Speaks

author : Jane Kenyon

text : 
I am the blossom pressed in a book, 
found again after two hundred years. . . . 

I am the maker, the lover, and the keeper.... 

When the young girl who starves 
sits down to a table 
she will sit beside me. . . . 

I am food on the prisoner's plate. . . . 

I am water rushing to the wellhead, 
filling the pitcher until it spills. . . . 

I am the patient gardener 
of the dry and weedy garden. . . . 

I am the stone step, 
the latch, and the working hinge. . . . 

I am the heart contracted by joy. . . . 
the longest hair, white 
before the rest. . . . 

I am there in the basket of fruit 
presented to the widow. . . . 

I am the musk rose opening 
unattended, the fern on the boggy summit. . . . 

I am the one whose love 
overcomes you, already with you 
when you think to call my name. . . .

title : Supple Cord

author : Naomi Shihab Nye

text : 
My brother, in his small white bed, 
held one end. 
I tugged the other 
to signal I was still awake. 
We could have spoken, 
could have sung 
to one another, 
we were in the same room 
for five years, 
but the soft cord 
with its little frayed ends 
connected us 
in the dark, 
gave comfort 
even if we had been bickering 
all day. 
When he fell asleep first 
and his end of the cord 
dropped to the floor, 
I missed him terribly, 
though I could hear his even breath 
and we had such long and separate lives 
ahead.

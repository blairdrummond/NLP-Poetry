title : Gathering the Bones Together

text : 
for Peter Orr   When all the rooms of the house  fill with smoke, it’s not enough  to say an angel is sleeping on the chimney.
1. a night in the barn 

The deer carcass hangs from a rafter. 
Wrapped in blankets, a boy keeps watch 
from a pile of loose hay. Then he sleeps 

and dreams about a death that is coming: 
Inside him, there are small bones 
scattered in a field among burdocks and dead grass. 
He will spend his life walking there, 
gathering the bones together. 

Pigeons rustle in the eaves. 
At his feet, the German shepherd 
snaps its jaws in its sleep. 


          2 
A father and his four sons 
run down a slope toward 
a deer they just killed. 
The father and two sons carry 
rifles. They laugh, jostle, 
and chatter together. 
A gun goes off 
and the youngest brother 
falls to the ground. 
A boy with a rifle 
stands beside him, 
screaming.

I crouch in the corner of my room, 
staring into the glass well 
of my hands; far down 
I see him drowning in air. 

Outside, leaves shaped like mouths 
make a black pool 
under a tree. Snails glide 
there, little death-swans. 


          4. smoke 
Something has covered the chimney 
and the whole house fills with smoke. 
I go outside and look up at the roof, 
but I can’t see anything. 
I go back inside. Everyone weeps, 
walking from room to room. 
Their eyes ache. This smoke 
turns people into shadows. 
Even after it is gone 
and the tears are gone, 
we will smell it in pillows 
when we lie down to sleep.

He lives in a house of black glass. 
Sometimes I visit him, and we talk. 
My father says he is dead, 
but what does that mean? 
Last night I found a child 
sleeping on a nest of bones. 
He had a red, leaf-shaped 
scar on his cheek. 
I lifted him up 
and carried him with me, 
though I didn’t know where I was going. 


          6. the journey 
Each night, I knelt on a marble slab 
and scrubbed at the blood. 
I scrubbed for years and still it was there. 
But tonight the bones in my feet 
begin to burn. I stand up 
and start walking, and the slab 
appears under my feet with each step, 
a white road only as long as your body. 


          7. the distance 
The winter I was eight, a horse 
slipped on the ice, breaking its leg. 
Father took a rifle, a can of gasoline. 
I stood by the road at dusk and watched 
the carcass burning in the far pasture. 

I was twelve when I killed him; 
I felt my own bones wrench from my body. 
Now I am twenty-seven and walk 
beside this river, looking for them. 
They have become a bridge 
that arches toward the other shore.

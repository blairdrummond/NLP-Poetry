title : Weighing Light

author : Geoffrey Brock

text : 
Often the slightest gesture is most telling,
As when he reaches tenderly in passing 
To pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall 

Of her hair, or even the absence of all gesture: 
The way she doesn’t need to turn to know 
Who, in this gathering of friends, has touched her. 

It was as if he dreamed some private garden. 
Perhaps he woke from it, mid-reach, to find 
His hand too near her hair in this crowded yard, 

And maybe even now she’s shuttering in 
(She’s even better than you or I at that) 
A storm of worry and recrimination— 

Did anyone notice? how could he do that here!— 
By seamlessly continuing to tell you 
About her trip to see her favorite Vermeer 

This morning in the Delft show at the Met: 
“So now they say she isn’t weighing pearls 
Or gold or anything—it’s just the light 

Gleaming off empty scales.” So much is hard 
To know for sure. If I confronted her, 
She’d say it was just a leaf—who could afford 

To disagree? Could we? Now she’s explaining 
How the girl faces a mirror we can’t see into 
And how behind her hangs a gloomy painting 

Of the Last Judgment: “Over her head God 
Floats in a cloud,” she says, “like a thought balloon.”   
But you don’t hear. You’re watching me. I nod.

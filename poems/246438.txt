title : Descant

author : Tyrone Williams

text : 
I left my heart in the teeth of jumper-cables— 
black tongue, superfluous nipples . . .

By The Time I hit the yellow tape— 
it was already turning red . . .

Of my fair and alabaster love?
My redundant chains drawn in chalk?

Halfway to the stars I stopped— 
turned, spat—it’s too late, baby . . .

                                                                     Bangkok
  
  
 Caught in a slip of particulars,
 say, between the dirt road
 and the brand-new
  
  
                                                        Seven-Eleven, a bucket
                                                        of lotus, three shades of red
                                                        in the mudbank giving way to
  
  
 workers, faces hidden
 behind kerchiefs, binding
 the copper tines of another
  
  
                                                       half-constructed building,
                                                       this fretwork, that rooftop’s
  
  
 progress up and up, the eye riding
 a motor’s rev, coming to
 a woman who leans
  
  
                                                       over the seventh story’s edge
                                                       for the pulley rope’s
                                                       basket of rice or rubber mallets,


then a sweep down into
 cattle now, their beige skin
 over bones, the look of loose tents,
  
  
                                                       or taking in a bronze
                                                       Buddha, hands folded over the First
  
  
 National Melting Company,
 the red gate, black gate,
 red, retina arriving
  
  
                                                       at a man throwing straw
                                                       clumps to earth so the seeds
                                                       don’t wash away,
  
  
 and the light behind him washing
 away,
  
  
                                                       and this desire, a gaze
                                                       shot along the border which is
  
  
 shaped like a question mark,
 cramped with hotels, pink neon
  
  
                                                       grammars blinking
                                                       Alpha, Alpha, Alpha Is
  
  
 The Bank For You And Your
 Needs, another quick catch,
  
  
                                                      the glance stippled
                                                       with disappearances,
  
  
 a girl who lifts her skirt
 to bathe near the bus stop,
  
  
                                                       a fire
                                                       burning/burnt/burning
                                                       in the field of bulldozers,
  
  
 an eye trying to fix itself
 as the vehicle turns,
  
  
                                                       the mind from
                                                       nascent to nation,
  
  
 drifting in instances, a grit
 in wind worrying
 the surface, the facts,
  
  
                                                       out to finger the invisible
                                                       gap we would inhabit, pulsing always
                                                       in between.

title : Dream of the Huntress

author : Robin Robertson

text : 
It is always the same: 
she is standing over me 

in the forest clearing, 
a dab of blood on her cheek 

from a rabbit or a deer. 
I am aware of nothing 

but my mutinous flesh, 
and the traps of desire 

sent to test itâ€” 
her bare arms, bare 

shoulders, her loosened hair, 
the hard, high breasts, 

and under a belt 
of knives and fish-lures, 

her undressed wound. 
Every night the same: 

the slashed fetlock, 
the buckling under; 

I wake in her body 
broken, like a gun.

A Description of Such a One As He Would Love 
Sir Thomas Wyatt 
1503-1542
Renaissance
England
Love, Infatuation & Crushes



A face that should content me wondrous well
Should not be fair but lovely to behold,
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;
With sober looks so would I that it should
Speak without words such words as none can tell;
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;
With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,
And knit again the knot that should not slide.

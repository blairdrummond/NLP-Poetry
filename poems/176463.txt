Every day I peruse the box scores for hours   
Sometimes I wonder why I do it 
Since I am not going to take a test on it   
And no one is going to give me money 

The pleasure’s something like that of codes   
Of deciphering an ancient alphabet say   
So as brightly to picturize Eurydice 
In the Elysian Fields on her perfect day 

The day she went 5 for 5 against Vic Raschi

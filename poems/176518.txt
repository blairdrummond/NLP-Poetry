title : Archaic Fragment

author : Louise Glück

text : 
I was trying to love matter.
I taped a sign over the mirror:
You cannot hate matter and love form.  

It was a beautiful day, though cold.
This was, for me, an extravagantly emotional gesture. 

.......your poem:
tried, but could not.

I taped a sign over the first sign: 
Cry, weep, thrash yourself, rend your garments— 
 
List of things to love: 
dirt, food, shells, human hair. 

....... said
tasteless excess. Then I 

rent the signs. 

AIAIAIAI cried 
the naked mirror.

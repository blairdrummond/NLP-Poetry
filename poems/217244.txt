title : Body and Soul

author : Sharon Bryan

text : 
They grow up together 
but they aren't even fraternal 

twins, they quarrel a lot 
about where to go and what 

to do, the body complains 
about having to carry 

the soul everywhere as if 
it were some helpless cripple, 

and the soul snipes that it can go 
places the body never dreamed of, 

then they quarrel over which one of them 
does the dreaming, but the truth is, 

they can't live without each other and 
they both know it, anima, animosity, 

the diaphragm pumps like a bellows 
and the soul pulls out all the stops— 

sings at the top of its lungs, laughs 
at its little jokes, it would like 

to think it has the upper hand 
and can leave whenever it wants— 

but only as long as it knows 
the door will be unlocked 

when it sneaks back home before 
the sun comes up, and when the body 

says where have you been, the soul 
says, with a smirk, I was at the end 

of my tether, and it was, like a diver 
on the ocean floor or an astronaut 

admiring the view from outside 
the mother ship, and like them 

it would be lost without its air 
supply and protective clothing, 

the body knows that and begins 
to hum, I get along without you 

very well, and   the soul says, Listen 
to that, you can't sing worth a lick 

without me, they'll go on bickering 
like this until death do them part— 

and then, even if the soul seems to float 
above the body for a moment, 

like a flame above a candle, pinch 
the wick and it disappears.

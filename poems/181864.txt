title : For Freckle-Faced Gerald

author : Etheridge Knight

Now you take ol Rufus. He beat drums, 
was free and funky under the arms, 
fucked white girls, jumped off a bridge 
(and thought nothing of the sacrilege), 
he copped out—and he was over twenty-one. 

Take Gerald. Sixteen years hadn’t even done 
a good job on his voice. He didn’t even know 
how to talk tough, or how to hide the glow 
of life before he was thrown in as “pigmeat” 
for the buzzards to eat. 

Gerald, who had no memory or hope of copper hot lips— 
or firm upthrusting thighs 
to reinforce his flow, 
let tall walls and buzzards change the course 
of his river from south to north. 

(No safety in numbers, like back on the block: 
two’s aplenty. three? definitely not. 
four? “you’re all muslims.” 
five? “you were planning a race riot.” 
plus, Gerald could never quite win 
with his precise speech and innocent grin 
the trust and fists of the young black cats.) 

Gerald, sun-kissed ten thousand times on the nose 
and cheeks, didn’t stand a chance, 
didn’t even know that the loss of his balls 
had been plotted years in advance 
by wiser and bigger buzzards than those 
who now hover above his track 
and at night light upon his back.

text : 
He lives, who last night flopped from a log   
Into the creek, and all night by an ankle   
Lay pinned to the flood, dead as a nail   
But for the skin of the teeth of his dog. 

I brought him boiled eggs and broth.   
He coughed and waved his spoon 
And sat up saying he would dine alone,   
Being fatigue itself after that bath. 

I sat without in the sun with the dog.   
Wearing a stocking on the ailing foot,   
In monster crutches, he hobbled out,   
And addressed the dog in bitter rage. 

He told the yellow hound, his rescuer,   
Its heart was bad, and it ought 
Not wander by the creek at night; 
If all his dogs got drowned he would be poor. 

He stroked its head and disappeared in the shed   
And came out with a stone mallet in his hands   
And lifted that rocky weight of many pounds   
And let it lapse on top of the dog's head. 

I carted off the carcass, dug it deep. 
Then he came too with what a thing to lug,   
Or pour on a dog’s grave, his thundermug,   
And poured it out and went indoors to sleep. 

I saw him sleepless in the pane of glass   
Looking wild-eyed at sunset, then the glare   
Blinded the glass—only a red square   
Burning a house burning in the wilderness.

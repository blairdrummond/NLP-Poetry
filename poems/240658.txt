One    
  
 Green moves through the tops of trees and grows
 lighter greens as it recedes, each of which includes a grey, and among the
 greys, or beyond them, waning finely into white, there is one white spot,
 absolute; it could be an egret or perhaps a crane at the edge of the water
 where it meets a strip of sand.



Two    
  
 There is a single, almost dazzling white spot of a white house out loud
 against the fields, and the forest in lines
 receding, rises,
 and then planes. Color,
  
 in pieces or entire; its presence
 veneers over want; in all its moving parts, it could be something else
  
 half-hidden by trees. Conservatory, gloriette, gazebo, or bandshell,
 a door ajar on the top floor.



Three    
 The trees are half air. They fissure the sky; you could count the leaves, pare
 time
                               defined as that which,
                               no matter how barely, exceeds
                               what the eye could grasp in a glance;
 intricate woods opening out before a body of water edged
 with a swatch of meadow where someone has hung a bright white sheet
 out in the sun to dry.
  
    
  
Four    
  
 A white bird in a green forest is a danger to itself. Stands out. Shines. Builds
 up inside. Like it’s dangerous to cry while driving or to talk to strangers or to 
 stare at the sun and a thousand other things
                                                                                    we’ve always heard
 people who wear white see better at night, though they gradually lose this
 trait as they age.
  
  

Five    
  
 The air across the valley is slightly hazy though thinning though patches
 remain between the groves of trees that edge a clearing in which stands a
 single house. A child in a white t-shirt has just walked out of the house and
 is turning to walk down to the lake.

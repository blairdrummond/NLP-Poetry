Davy Jones' Door-Bell 
Vachel Lindsay 
1879-1931


Nature, Seas, Rivers, & Streams

Assonance, Consonance

A Chant for Boys with Manly Voices(Every line sung one step deeper than the line preceding)
Any sky-bird sings,
         Ring, ring!
Any church-chime rings,
         Dong ding!
Any cannon says,
         Boom bang!
Any whirlwind says,
         Whing whang!
The bell-buoy hums and roars,
         Ding dong!
And way down deep,
Where fishes throng,
By Davy Jones' big deep?sea door,
Shaking the ocean's flowery floor,
His door-bell booms
         Dong dong,
         Dong dong,
Deep, deep down,
         Clang boom,
         Boom dong.

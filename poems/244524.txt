two divisions.
 one)
         knowing. nothing. into. understand.
         two)
                 something.
                 touched.
                 someone.

 
1)     sequences outside of the categories
         labelled ‘telephones’
         e.g. the milk arrived.
 
2)    the things all found a personal
        vocabulary. every word insulted
        everyone
        without looking.
  
 1)    knowing nothing into understand.   and
         this almost said solemnly was the one
         that least occurred to me.
  
          ii) i sent my heart in the upper pocked
                or perhaps we made the bed in two
                seconds after we eliminated the
                third floor.
  
         and nothing else to risk but
         to hear her drinking.   1)
  
 something solemn touched something in the
               upper pocket.
    
    

2)
  
 knowing something touched nothing without
                            drinking.  1)
 (i love onions 2)
  
 i told her so one.
 in one second 2.
  
 in two seconds flat
 the things that change conceal
  
 a system of ideas
 for instance the trains went by to come
 back on a roll of film
  
 they were both standing in the courtyard
 when i came she was
  
2)    sitting on the steps in a mans
         handwriting shutting my eyes to what
         remains to be said.
  
 1)    an immense silence which had nothing to
         do with silence.
  
  
2)    for a long spell
         a spell of weeping begins to come.

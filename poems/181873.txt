Dear Folks, 

(Smile) 
Enclosed, is the Ordinary River. 
It is called “That Devil,” 
In whose name the locals are baptized. 
Finally that river twists 
Like a hurt thing— 
They say it’s nothing. 
It has become a new road 
In a naked place. 
Then, I am nothing 
And it is that dream 
I dreamed I dreamed. 

               Sincerely, 


                              ~ 


               Hello, 

I have just passed “Doubt,” 
It is near “Milk Teeth,” 
And “Nothing,” and “Falling Out.” 
There are flowers and evidence 
Of ambiguous winds. 
“Doubt” is like a man 
Walking in his sleep, seriously. 
Offhand, it reminds me 
Of a Jamesian novel 
With the motives, the motives, the motives. 

               Have Mercy, 


                              ~ 


               Say, 

To get to Innocence, 
You take the narrow trail 
From Deep. 
You squeeze into the mountain’s waves. 
If you meet savage rock, 
It is the wrong way. 
Turn left. . . 
There, then, in our hearts’ 
Honeymoon, lay I. 

               Queequeg

               J.P., 

Today is Friday. 
We are still on the hill 
Called Spirit of the Wind 
But we are down real low 
Like new flame 
Just to be close. 

               Dad

               Baby G., 

Sunday, 
And what you are probably babbling 
I seem to see, 
(I.e.) at 60 mph 
This is the alfalfa field 
Of my heart. 
There is no museum here, 
And in a convertible, 
Where birds can sing, 
Anything is possible. 

               Dad

               Milton, 

There is a mountain called Can 
She is blind with snow 
But all seers are blind 
What we need 
In the morning when we always see her 
And are always reborn 
Is a magnificent horn 
And the strangely uneven voice 
Of her life 

               Thanks, 


                              ~ 


               Bill, 

I checked this out. . . 
You know that ridge up there 
Is north, because you know 
For no reason (except this). 
A great wind blows. 
Behind it, the stars come out 
Virtually human. 
And here you are, apparently 
Crude, like the sound 
Of a breaking string 
That seems to come from the sky. 

               So Long,

title : Days

author : Philip Larkin

text : 
What are days for? 
Days are where we live.   
They come, they wake us   
Time and time over. 
They are to be happy in:   
Where can we live but days? 

Ah, solving that question 
Brings the priest and the doctor   
In their long coats 
Running over the fields.

Blank Verse

O For that warning voice, which he who saw 
Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, 
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, 
Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, 
Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now, 
While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd 
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd 
Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now 
Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, 
The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, 
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss 
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: 
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, 
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, 
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth 
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, 
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles 
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract 
His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr 
The Hell within him, for within him Hell 
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell 
One step no more then from himself can fly 
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair 
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie 
Of what he was, what is, and what must be 
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. 
Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view 
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, 
Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun, 
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: 
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. 

O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, 
Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God 
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs 
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, 
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name 
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams 
That bring to my remembrance from what state 
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; 
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down 
Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: 
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return 
From me, whom he created what I was 
In that bright eminence, and with his good 
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. 
What could be less then to afford him praise, 
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, 
How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, 
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high 
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher 
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit 
The debt immense of endless gratitude, 
So burthensome still paying, still to ow; 
Forgetful what from him I still receivd, 
And understood not that a grateful mind 
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once 
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? 
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind 
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood 
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd 
Ambition.   Yet why not? som other Power 
As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean 
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great 
Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within 
Or from without, to all temptations arm'd. 
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? 
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, 
But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all? 
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, 
To me alike, it deals eternal woe. 
Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will 
Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
Me miserable! which way shall I flie 
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? 
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; 
And in the lowest deep a lower deep 
Still threatning to devour me opens wide, 
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n. 
O then at last relent: is there no place 
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? 
None left but by submission; and that word 
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd 
With other promises and other vaunts 
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue 
Th' Omnipotent.   Ay me, they little know 
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, 
Under what torments inwardly I groane; 
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, 
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd 
The lower still I fall, onely Supream 
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. 
But say I could repent and could obtaine 
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon 
Would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay 
What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant 
Vows made in pain, as violent and void. 
For never can true reconcilement grow 
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: 
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare 
Short intermission bought with double smart. 
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr 
From granting hee, as I from begging peace: 
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead 
Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, 
Mankind created, and for him this World. 
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, 
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; 
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least 
Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold 
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; 
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. 

Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face 
Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, 
Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid 
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. 
For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule 
Are ever cleer.   Whereof hee soon aware, 
Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, 
Artificer of fraud; and was the first 
That practisd falshood under saintly shew, 
Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: 
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive 
Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down 
The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount 
Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall 
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce 
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, 
As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. 
So on he fares, and to the border comes, 
Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, 
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, 
As with a rural mound the champain head 
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides 
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, 
Access deni'd; and over head up grew 
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, 
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, 
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend 
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre 
Of stateliest view.   Yet higher then thir tops 
The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: 
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large 
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. 
And higher then that Wall a circling row 
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, 
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue 
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: 
On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams 
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, 
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd 
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire 
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires 
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive 
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales 
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense 
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole 
Those balmie spoiles.   As when to them who saile 
Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 
Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow 
Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare 
Of Arabie the blest, with such delay 
Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League 
Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. 
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend 
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd 
Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, 
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse 
Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent 
From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. 

Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill 
Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; 
But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, 
As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth 
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext 
All path of Man or Beast that past that way: 
One Gate there only was, and that look'd East 
On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw 
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, 
At one slight bound high over leap'd all bound 
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within 
Lights on his feet.   As when a prowling Wolfe, 
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, 
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve 
In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, 
Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:. 
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash 
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, 
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, 
In at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; 
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: 
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. 
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, 
The middle Tree and highest there that grew, 
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life 
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death 
To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought 
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd 
For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge 
Of immortality.   So little knows 
Any, but God alone, to value right 
The good before him, but perverts best things 
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. 
Beneath him with new wonder now he views 
To all delight of human sense expos'd 
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, 
A Heav'n on Earth, for blissful Paradise 
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East 
Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line 
From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs 
Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, 
Or where the Sons of Eden long before 
Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile 
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; 
Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow 
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; 
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, 
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit 
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life 
Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by, 
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. 
Southward through Eden went a River large, 
Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill 
Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown 
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd 
Upon the rapid current, which through veins 
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, 
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill 
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell 
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, 
Which from his darksom passage now appeers, 
And now divided into four main Streams, 
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme 
And Country whereof here needs no account, 
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, 
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, 
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, 
With mazie error under pendant shades 
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art 
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon 
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, 
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote 
The open field, and where the unpierc't shade 
lmbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, 
A happy rural seat of various view; 
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, 
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde 
Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, 
If true, here only, and of delicious taste: 
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks 
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, 
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap 
Of som irriguous Valley spred her store, 
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: 
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves 
Of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine 
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps 
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall 
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, 
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, 
Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. 
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, 
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune 
The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan 
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance 
Led on th' Eternal Spring.   Not that faire field 
Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours 
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis 
Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain 
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove 
Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd 
Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise 
Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile 
Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, 
Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, 
Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son 
Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye; 
Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, 
Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd 
True Paradise under the Ethiop Line 
By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock, 
A whole days journy high, but wide remote 
From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend 
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind 
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: 
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, 
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad 
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, 
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine 
The image of thir glorious Maker shon, 
Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, 
Severe but in true filial freedom plac't; 
Whence true autoritie in men; though both 
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; 
For contemplation hee and valour formd, 
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, 
Hee for God only, shee for God in him: 
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd 
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks 
Round from his parted forelock manly hung 
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: 
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste 
Her unadorned golden tresses wore 
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd 
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd 
Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, 
And by her yielded, by him best receivd, 
Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, 
And sweet reluctant amorous delay. 
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, 
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame 
Of natures works, honor dishonorable, 
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind 
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, 
And banisht from mans life his happiest life, 
Simplicitie and spotless innocence. 
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight 
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: 
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair 
That ever since in loves imbraces met, 
Adam the goodliest man of men since borne 
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. 
Under a tuft of shade that on a green 
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side 
They sat them down, and after no more toil 
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd 
To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease 
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite 
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, 
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes 
Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline 
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: 
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde 
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; 
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles 
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems 
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, 
Alone as they.   About them frisking playd 
All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase 
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; 
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw 
Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards, 
Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant 
To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd 
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly 
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine 
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile 
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass 
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, 
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun 
Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer 
To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale 
Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: 
When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, 
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. 

O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, 
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't 
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, 
Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright 
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue 
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines 
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace 
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. 
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh 
Your change approaches, when all these delights 
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, 
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; 
Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd 
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n 
Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe 
As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe 
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne 
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, 
And mutual amitie so streight, so close, 
That I with you must dwell, or you with me 
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please 
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such 
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, 
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold, 
To entertain you two, her widest Gates, 
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, 
Not like these narrow limits, to receive 
ass Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, 
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge 
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. 
And should I at your harmless innocence 
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, 
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd, 
By conquering this new World, compels me now 
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. 

So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, 
The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. 
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree 
Down he alights among the sportful Herd 
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, 
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end 
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd 
To mark what of thir state he more might learn 
By word or action markt: about them round 
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, 
Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi'd 
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, 
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft 
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground 
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both 
Grip't in each paw: When Adam first of men 
To first of women Eve thus moving speech, 
Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. 

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, 
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the power 
That made us, and for us this ample World 
Be infinitly good, and of his good 
As liberal and free as infinite, 
That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here 
In all this happiness, who at his hand 
Have nothing merited, nor can performe 
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires 
From us no other service then to keep 
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees 
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
So various, not to taste that onely Tree 
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, 
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, 
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst 
God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, 
The only sign of our obedience left 
Among so many signes of power and rule 
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n 
Over all other Creatures that possess 
Earth, Aire, and Sea.   Then let us not think hard 
One easie prohibition, who enjoy 
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice 
Unlimited of manifold delights: 
But let us ever praise him, and extoll 
His bountie, following our delightful task 
To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours, 
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. 

To whom thus Eve repli'd.   O thou for whom 
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, 
And without whom am to no end, my Guide 
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. 
For wee to him indeed all praises owe, 
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy 
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee 
Praeeminent by so much odds, while thou 
Like consort to thy self canst no where find. 
That day I oft remember, when from sleep 
I first awak't, and found my self repos'd 
Under a shade of flours, much wondring where 
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread 
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd 
Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went 
With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe 
On the green bank, to look into the cleer 
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. 
As I bent down to look, just opposite, 
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd 
Bending to look on me, I started back, 
It started back, but pleas'd I soon returnd, 
Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks 
Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt 
Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, 
Had not a voice thus warnd me,   What thou seest, 
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, 
With thee it came and goes: but follow me, 
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies 
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee 
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy 
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare 
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd 
Mother of human Race: what could I doe, 
But follow strait, invisibly thus led? 
Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, 
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, 
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, 
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, 
Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return faire Eve, 
Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, 
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent 
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart 
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side 
Henceforth an individual solace dear; 
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim 
My other half: with that thy gentle hand 
Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see 
How beauty is excelld by manly grace 
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 

So spake our general Mother, and with eyes 
Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, 
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand 
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast 
Naked met his under the flowing Gold 
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight 
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms 
Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter 
On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds 
That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip 
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd 
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne 
Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. 

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two 
Imparadis't in one anothers arms 
The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill 
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, 
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, 
Among our other torments not the least, 
Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; 
Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd 
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: 
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, 
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? 
Suspicious, reasonless.   Why should thir Lord 
Envie them that? can it be sin to know, 
Can it be death? and do they onely stand 
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, 
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? 
O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds 
With more desire to know, and to reject 
Envious commands, invented with designe 
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt 
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, 
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? 
But first with narrow search I must walk round 
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; 
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet 
Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, 
Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw 
What further would be learnt.   Live while ye may, 
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, 
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. 

So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, 
But with sly circumspection, and began 
Through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. 
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n 
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun 
Slowly descended, and with right aspect 
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise 
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock 
Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, 
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent 
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; 
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung 
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. 
Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat 
Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; 
About him exercis'd Heroic Games 
Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand 
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares, 
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. 
Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven 
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr 
In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd 
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner 
From what point of his Compass to beware 
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. 

Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv'n 
Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place 
No evil thing approach or enter in; 
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare 
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know 
More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man 
Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way 
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; 
But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, 
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks 
Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: 
Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade 
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew 
I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise 
New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 

To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: 
Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, 
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, 
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass 
The vigilance here plac't, but such as come 
Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour 
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, 
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds 
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude 
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. 
But if within the circuit of these walks, 
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom 
Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. 

So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge 
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd 
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n 
Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb, 
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd 
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth 
By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there 
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold 
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: 
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray 
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; 
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, 
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests 
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; 
She all night long her amorous descant sung; 
Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament 
With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led 
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon 
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length 
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, 
And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. 

When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour 
Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest 
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set 
Labour and rest, as day and night to men 
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep 
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines 
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long 
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; 
Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, 
And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; 
While other Animals unactive range, 
And of thir doings God takes no account. 
To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East 
With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, 
And at our pleasant labour, to reform 
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, 
Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, 
That mock our scant manuring, and require 
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: 
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, 
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, 
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; 
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. 

To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. 
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst 
Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, 
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more 
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. 
With thee conversing I forget all time, 
All seasons and thir change, all please alike. 
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, 
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun 
When first on this delightful Land he spreads 
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, 
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth 
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on 
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night 
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, 
And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: 
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends 
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun 
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, 
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, 
Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night 
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, 
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. 
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom 
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? 

To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. 
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, 
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, 
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land 
In order, though to Nations yet unborn, 
Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; 
Least total darkness should by Night regaine 
Her old possession, and extinguish life 
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires 
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate 
Of various influence foment and warme, 
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down 
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow 
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive 
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. 
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, 
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, 
That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; 
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth 
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. 
All these with ceasless praise his works behold 
Both day and night: how often from the steep 
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard 
Celestial voices to the midnight air, 
Sole, or responsive each to others note 
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands 
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk 
With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds 
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs 
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 

Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd 
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place 
Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd 
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew 
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side 
Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub 
Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, 
Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin 
Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought 
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, 
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay 
Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone 
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here 
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; 
Such was thir awe of Man.   In shadie Bower 
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, 
Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, 
Nor Faunus haunted.   Here in close recess 
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs 
Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed, 
And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, 
What day the genial Angel to our Sire 
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, 
More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods 
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like 
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son 
Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd 
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd 
On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. 

Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood 
Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd 
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav'n 
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe 
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, 
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, 
Which we in our appointed work imployd 
Have finisht happie in our mutual help 
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss 
Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place 
For us too large, where thy abundance wants 
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. 
But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race 
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll 
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, 
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 

This said unanimous, and other Rites 
Observing none, but adoration pure 
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre 
Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off 
These troublesom disguises which wee wear, 
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene 
Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites 
Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: 
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk 
Of puritie and place and innocence, 
Defaming as impure what God declares 
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. 
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain 
But our destroyer, foe to God and Man? 
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source 
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, 
In Paradise of all things common else. 
By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men 
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee 
Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure, 
Relations dear, and all the Charities 
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. 
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, 
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, 
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, 
Whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, 
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. 
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights 
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, 
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile 
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, 
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours 
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, 
Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings 
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. 
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, 
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof 
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd.   Sleep on 
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek 
No happier state, and know to know no more. 

Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone 
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, 
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim 
Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd 
To thir night watches in warlike Parade, 
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 

Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South 
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, 
Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part 
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. 
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld 
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed 
Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook, 
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, 
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. 
This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd 
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen 
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd 
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: 
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 

So saying, on he led his radiant Files, 
Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct 
In search of whom they sought: him there they found 
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; 
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach 
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge 
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, 
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint 
Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise 
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise 
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, 
Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires 
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. 
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear 
Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure 
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns 
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts 
Discoverd and surpriz'd.   As when a spark 
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid 
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store 
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine 
With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: 
So started up in his own shape the Fiend. 
Back stept those two faire Angels half amaz'd 
So sudden to behold the grieslie King; 
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. 

Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell 
Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, 
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite 
Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 

Know ye not then said Satan, fill'd with scorn, 
Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate 
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; 
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, 
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, 
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin 
Your message, like to end as much in vain? 
To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. 
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, 
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known 
As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; 
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, 
Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now 
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. 
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account 
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep 
This place inviolable, and these from harm. 

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke 
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace 
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, 
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw 
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd 
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd 
His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd 
Undaunted.   If I must contend, said he, 
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, 
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, 
Or less be lost.   Thy fear, said Zephon bold, 
Will save us trial what the least can doe 
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. 

The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; 
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, 
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie 
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld 
His heart, not else dismai'd.   Now drew they nigh 
The western Point, where those half-rounding guard 
just met, and closing stood in squadron joind 
Awaiting next command.   To whom thir Chief 
Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. 

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet 
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne 
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, 
And with them comes a third of Regal port, 
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate 
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, 
Not likely to part hence without contest; 
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 

He scarce had ended, when those two approachd 
And brief related whom they brought, where found, 
How busied, in what form and posture coucht. 
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. 

Why hast thou, Satan broke the bounds prescrib'd 
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge 
Of others, who approve not to transgress 
By thy example, but have power and right 
To question thy bold entrance on this place; 
Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those 
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? 

To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow. 
Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, 
And such I held thee; but this question askt 
Puts me in doubt.   Lives ther who loves his pain? 
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, 
Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, 
And boldly venture to whatever place 
Farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change 
Torment with ease, and soonest recompence 
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; 
To thee no reason; who knowst only good, 
But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object 
His will who bound us? let him surer barr 
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay 
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. 
The rest is true, they found me where they say; 
But that implies not violence or harme. 

Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel mov'd, 
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. 
O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, 
Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, 
And now returns him from his prison scap't, 
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise 
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither 
Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; 
So wise he judges it to fly from pain 
However, and to scape his punishment. 
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, 
Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight 
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, 
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain 
Can equal anger infinite provok't. 
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee 
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them 
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they 
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, 
The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd 
To thy deserted host this cause of flight, 
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. 
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, 
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood 
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide 
Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed 
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. 
But still thy words at random, as before, 
Argue thy inexperience what behooves 
From hard assaies and ill successes past 
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all 
Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. 
I therefore, I alone first undertook 
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie 
This new created World, whereof in Hell 
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find 
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers 
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; 
Though for possession put to try once more 
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; 
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord 
High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, 
And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. 

To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli'd. 
To say and strait unsay, pretending first 
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, 
Argues no Leader but a lyar trac't, 
Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, 
O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! 
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? 
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; 
Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, 
Your military obedience, to dissolve 
Allegeance to th' acknowldg'd Power supream? 
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem 
Patron of liberty, who more then thou 
Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd 
Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope 
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? 
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; 
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre 
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, 
Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, 
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne 
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. 

So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats 
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. 

Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, 
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then 
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel 
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King 
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, 
Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels 
In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. 

While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright 
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes 
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round 
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field 
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind 
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands 
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves 
Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd 
Collecting all his might dilated stood, 
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: 
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest 
Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe 
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds 
Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise 
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope 
Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements 
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne 
With violence of this conflict, had not soon 
Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray 
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen 
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, 
Wherein all things created first he weighd, 
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire 
In counterpoise, now ponders all events, 
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights 
The sequel each of parting and of fight; 
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; 
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 

Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, 
Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then 
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more 
Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now 
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, 
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign 
Where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, 
If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew 
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled 
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

I 

1 

Pearl, the precious prize of a king, 
Chastely set in cherished gold, 
In all the East none equalling,   
No peer to her could I behold. 
So round, so rare, a radiant thing, 
So smooth she was, so small of mold, 
Wherever I judged gems glimmering   
I set her apart, her price untold. 
Alas, I lost her in earth’s green fold; 
Through grass to the ground, I searched in vain. 
I languish alone; my heart grows cold 
For my precious pearl without a stain.

Since in that spot it slipped from me, 
I lingered, longing for that delight   
That from my sins once set me free 
And my happiness raised to the highest height. 
Her going wounds me grievously; 
It burns my breast both day and night. 
Yet I never imagined a melody 
So sweet as she, so brief, and slight. 
But memory flowed through my mind’s sight: 
I thought how her color in clods had lain 
O dust that dims what once was bright, 
My precious pearl without a stain.

Rare spices on that spot must spread: 
Such riches there to rot have run, 
Blooms of yellow and blue and red, 
Their sheen a shimmer against the sun, 
Flower and fruit nor faded nor dead, 
Where the pearl dropped down in mouldering dun; 
Each grass from a lifeless grain is bred, 
Else to harvest no wheat were won: 
Always from good is good begun. 
So seemly a seed could not die in vain, 
That sprig nor spice there would be none   
Of that precious pearl without a stain.

To the spot which I in speech portray, 
I entered in that arbor green, 
In August on a holy day, 
When the corn is cut with sickles keen. 
On the little rise where my pearl rolled away, 
The fairest flowers formed a screen: 
Gillyflower, ginger, gromwell spray, 
With peonies powdered in between. 
If they were seemly to be seen, 
Far sweeter the scents from that domain, 
More worthy her dwelling, well I ween, 
My precious pearl without a stain.

I mourned, hands clenched, before that mound, 
For the piercing cold of grief had caught 
Me in the doleful dread and bound 
My heart, though reason solace sought. 
I longed for my pearl, locked in the ground, 
While fierce contentions in me fought. 
In Christ, though comfort could be found, 
My wretched will was still distraught. 
I fell upon that flowery plot. 
Such odors eddied in my brain, 
To sudden slumber I was brought 
By that precious pearl without a stain.

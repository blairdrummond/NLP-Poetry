IV. The Fireflies 

I have climbed blind the way down through the trees 
(How faint the phosphorescence of the stones) 
On nights when not a light showed on the bay 
And nothing marked the line of sky and sea
Only the beating of the heart defined
A space of being in the faceless dark,
The foot that found and won the path from blindness, 
The hand, outstretched, that touched on branch and bark. 
The soundless revolution of the stars 
Brings back the fireflies and each constellation, 
And we are here half-shielded from that height 
Whose star-points feed the white lactation, far 
Incandescence where the single star
Is lost to sight. This is a waiting time.
Those thirty, lived-out years were slow to rhyme 
With consonances unforeseen, and, gone, 
Were brief beneath the seasons and the sun. 
We wait now on the absence of our dead, 
Sharing the middle world of moving lights 
Where fireflies taking torches to the rose 
Hover at those clustered, half-lit porches, 
Eyelid on closed eyelid in their glow 
Flushed into flesh, then darkening as they go. 
The adagio of lights is gathering
Across the sway and counter-lines as bay 
And sky, contrary in motion, swerve 
Against each other's patternings, while these 
Tiny, travelling fires gainsay them both, 
Trusting to neither empty space nor seas 
The burden of their weightless circlings. We, 
Knowing no more of death than other men 
Who make the last submission and return, 
Savour the good wine of a summer's night 
Fronting the islands and the harbour bar, 
Uncounted in the sum of our unknowings
How sweet the fireflies’ span to those who live it, 
Equal, in their arrivals and their goings, 
With the order and the beauty of star on star.

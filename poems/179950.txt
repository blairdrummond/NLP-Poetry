title : Vespers ["Once I believed in you..."]

author : Louise Gl√ºck

text : 
Once I believed in you; I planted a fig tree. 
Here, in Vermont, country 
of no summer. It was a test: if the tree lived, 
it would mean you existed. 

By this logic, you do not exist. Or you exist 
exclusively in warmer climates, 
in fervent Sicily and Mexico and California, 
where are grown the unimaginable 
apricot and fragile peach. Perhaps 
they see your face in Sicily; here we barely see 
the hem of your garment. I have to discipline myself 
to share with John and Noah the tomato crop. 

If there is justice in some other world, those 
like myself, whom nature forces 
into lives of abstinence, should get 
the lion's share of all things, all 
objects of hunger, greed being 
praise of you. And no one praises 
more intensely than I, with more 
painfully checked desire, or more deserves 
to sit at your right hand, if it exists, partaking 
of the perishable, the immortal fig, 
which does not travel.

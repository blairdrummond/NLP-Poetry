title : Shore Line

author : Carl Rakosi

text : 
We speak of mankind.   
Why not wavekind? 

Barrel-chested military water   
rushes in a mass 
to break the shore earth 
into stonekind. 

Pphlooph pphlooph 
                              the waves grope   
indistinctly for the shore. 

As delicate 
                  as a butterfly 
along a cheek 
                     a boat with white 
and orange sail appears. 
A small boy in a life-belt 
sits in front and looks ahead 
with all his might. 
                      His father steers,   
attached like a shaft 
to his son’s safety 
and the sail’s management. 

A sunfish thrown back by a fisherman   
lies drowned and pitching.   
The eyes are white in death. 

This is the raw data. 
A mystery translates it 
into feeling and perception;   
then imagination; 
finally the hard 
inevitable quartz 
figure of will 
                      and language. 
Thus a squirrel tail flying 
from a handlebar 
unmistakably establishes 
its passing rider 
as a male unbowed 
                         in a chipper plume.

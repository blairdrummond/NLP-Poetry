All evening I hunted 
the bird that wanted 
a cage of glass, 
here where cemetery 
slides into creek, fronting 
what was once the largest 
indoor leather mill in the world. 
There the skins gathered 
for cleansing, coloring, 
scraping, shipping off. 

It closed three years after 
a lone sparrow set up camp 
behind the only desk 
in the only full-serve 
service station left in town 
where, from four to seven 
nightly one summer, 
I blackened the pages 
of books with my thumbs. 

Whatever it sought there— 
thumping its frightened body 
against glass, into cabinets 
or out to the bays 
scrubbed raw with gasoline 
where the broken waited 
to be raised up, hosed off, 
fastened together in hope 
of coughing to life again— 
whatever it sought was not a dollar 
slipped through a window cracked 
because patronage was right 
for the aging ladies of August to provide 
from Chryslers cool in the sun. 

There was nothing to be found 
in books or boxes of parts. 
And the tools hanging from pegs 
were as useless as my hands, 
which could not patch together 
those straggling conveyances 
any more than I could 
with a tattered broom 
batter the bird to freedom 
as I swung at fluttering terror 
as I sought with useless devices 
some fortune reposed 
in corners of grease and dust.

Pyongyang, if you’ll please, STOP 
                                        appearing 
                                        in the poem 
like this— 
unannounced 

* 

In writing to your 
Pomomomo 

(that special critical topos 
between an ideolophe fahtha’
and a para-juridical muhtha’ )

This-side-of-the-Hudson 
Psycho-Acoustics 

Jangling— 

Claim you 
what? 

“We call it dead in the wa wa 
don’ mean jacky bits” 

“Pyongyang” 

* 

But it does...
as an In Walk Bud 
flips the whooole session 
on its head 

lexicals 
in range 
clash 
and dash out 

patch 14ths 
off the scale 
to perfect fifths 
effects 

REACT 
rather more differently 
than before 

with   
“Pyongyang” 
in there 

* 

And “Quetzalcoatl” 

Lands on 
“Tarragon” 
jangling it? 

If that’s where the Nitro’s stored, in 
“Tarragon” 

bird’s already been 
blown off 

feathers 
falling 

field’s been 
re-charged 

* 

And “Thatcher?” as guest 
jaw-harp 
soloist? 

The E.U.’s 
formative   
contradictions 

unresolved? 

some kill in that cut— 

you got the mic, pomomomo 

make a ho’ youself 

and Maggy 

and us

title : My Dog Practices Geometry

author : Cathryn Essinger

text : 
I do not understand the poets who tell me 
that I should not personify. Every morning 
the willow auditions for a new role 

outside my bedroom window—today she is 
Clytemnestra; yesterday a Southern Belle, 
lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts. 

Nor do I like the mathematicians who tell me 
I cannot say, "The zinnias are counting on their 
fingers," or "The dog is practicing her geometry," 

even though every day I watch her using 
the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle 
from which she bisects the circumference 

of the lawn until she finds the place where 
the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped 
the ante by climbing into a new Euclidian plane. 

She stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling 
her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working 
the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention, 

her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, 
yes, even over themselves, until I go out to assist, 
by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, "There! 

There!" But instead of following my outstretched 
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is 
now lounging under a canopy of leaves, 

catching its breath, charting its next escape, 
she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, 
confident that I—who can bring her home 

from across the field with a word, who 
can speak for the willow and the zinnia— 
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.

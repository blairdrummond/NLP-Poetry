The first person in recorded history
 struck by a comet slept on her couch
 across the road from the Comet Drive-In
  
 and the comet found her roof, her sadness, her knee,
 and woke her. Everything that hurts
  
 hurt before, she said. Showing at the drive-in, a documentary
 on tightrope-walking: a young man frustrated
 that his dream, the World Trade Center, was not yet built
  
 so he practiced for years in a meadow crossing intended sky, intent
 like a pillowcase sweetening him, no harm . . . Here
  
 let the towers go, let them write his crossing, cursive, back and forth
  
 his name steadying our tongues . . . Famous, overcoat
 floating down without him, the idea that we stand
  
 where we mean to stand, 1974, a distraction
  
 from my parents’ morning commute. At 59th Street they split.
 The poems I was writing were no longer poems of their divorce,
  
 my father’s sweeping gestures or his pain, the old Volkswagen
 and garden hose—all of that had washed from my poems
  
 and instead an imaginary family arrived in borrowed gardens,
 their son stillborn—even as I grew heavy with my own son
 I wrote poem after poem holding this imagined horror close.

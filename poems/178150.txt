title : The Bitterness of Children

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
Foreseeing typographical errors   
on their gravestones, the children   
from infancy—are bitter. 
Little clairvoyants, blond, in terror. 

Foreseeing the black and yellow   
room behind the eyelids, the children   
are bitter—from infancy. 
The blue egg of thirst: say hello. 

Foreseeing the lower lips of glaciers   
sliding toward their own lips, the children   
from infancy—are bitter. 
Them, rats, snakes: the chased and chasers. 

Foreseeing a dust-filled matchbox, the heart,   
the temples’ temples closing, the children   
are bitter—from infancy. 
From the marrow in the marrow: the start.

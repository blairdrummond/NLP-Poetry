title : On Old Ideas

author : Dorothea Lasky

Kissing the bankteller outside his stairs
 In Brighton, MA I cannot lie. I felt the hope
 That we once felt, if only for an instant
 O the lovely bankteller, like a moose he
 Rode my spirit quite outside my clothes
 And chrysanthemums sprouted I assure you
 Out my nipples when he kissed them.
 And the pureness of not knowing him at all
 Was really what we all feel when we enter this earth.
 There is a newness to the best things that cannot
 Be excelled and old things like old love die and rot.
 There are old ideas in the world that should be forgotten
 There are old ideas and old phrases that should at least
 Be recycled for others
 There are old plans now that should be new.
 There are old thoughts in your head, my reader, and let them die.
 Follow me, I am the crusader of the new
 My spirit is a plastic rod that channels all our births.
 And in the mouths of the little beasts, we shall find the great
 Ocean that spits up black bugs all glittering on its shores.
 You know there is an anthem to the ages.
 There is an anthem of the ages.
 This is that anthem
 This is that anthem

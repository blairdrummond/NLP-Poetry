title : Little Fugue

An apple paring 
curled from the knife wetly 
    down my thumb— 
and what I had failed 
to do rightly touching that life 
    next to mine, wearing 
late afternoon’s numb 
luminosity, impaled me. 

    A hunter knee-deep 
in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov 
might have set there and then left, 
    back to doctoring, 
or choked off as too dark, wanton, 
    met the steep 
flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift, 
but stood only, hearing them. 

    Pouring the last tea 
of an evening, dark amber 
alive, breathing in quintessence 
    of India, 
I felt limber bark 
sheathing the shrub of my life’s tree 
with root good, but dense, 
dark, local, raw there, 

    and so in dark woke, 
the seeing doctor, two simple 
profiles of linked characters 
    in his air, 

cruel, good, a pair ample, true 
across that split yoke, 
true to its splayed force— 
simple so rare, though.

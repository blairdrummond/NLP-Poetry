title : O my pa-pa

Our fathers have formed a poetry workshop.
They sit in a circle of disappointment over our fastballs 
and wives. We thought they didn't read our stuff, 
whole anthologies of poems that begin, My father never, 
or those that end, and he was silent as a carp, 
or those with middles which, if you think 
of the right side as a sketch, look like a paunch 
of beer and worry, but secretly, with flashlights 
in the woods, they've read every word and noticed 
that our nine happy poems have balloons and sex 
and giraffes inside, but not one dad waving hello 
from the top of a hill at dusk. Theirs 
is the revenge school of poetry, with titles like 
"My Yellow Sheet Lad" and "Given Your Mother's Taste 
for Vodka, I'm Pretty Sure You're Not Mine." 
They're not trying to make the poems better 
so much as sharper or louder, more like a fishhook 
or electrocution, as a group 
they overcome their individual senilities, 
their complete distaste for language, how cloying 
it is, how like tears it can be, and remember 
every mention of their long hours at the office 
or how tired they were when they came home, 
when they were dragged through the door 
by their shadows. I don't know why it's so hard 
to write a simple and kind poem to my father, who worked, 
not like a dog, dogs sleep most of the day in a ball 
of wanting to chase something, but like a man, a man 
with seven kids and a house to feed, whose absence 
was his presence, his present, the Cheerios, 
the PF Flyers, who taught me things about trees, 
that they're the most intricate version of standing up, 
who built a grandfather clock with me so I would know 
that time is a constructed thing, a passing, ticking fancy.
A bomb. A bomb that'll go off soon for him, for me,
and I notice in our fathers' poems a reciprocal dwelling 
on absence, that they wonder why we disappeared
as soon as we got our licenses, why we wanted 
the rocket cars, as if running away from them 
to kiss girls who looked like mirrors of our mothers
wasn't fast enough, and it turns out they did 
start to say something, to form the words hey 
or stay, but we'd turned into a door full of sun,
into the burning leave, and were gone 
before it came to them that it was all right 
to shout, that they should have knocked us down 
with a hand on our shoulders, that they too are mystified 
by the distance men need in their love.

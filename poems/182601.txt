Applied geometry,   
measuring the height   
of a pine from   
like triangles,   
Rosa’s shadow stretches   
seven paces in   
low-slanting light of   
late Christmas afternoon.   
One hundred thirty nine steps   
up the hill until the sun is   
finally caught at the top of the tree,   
let’s see,   
twenty to one,   
one hundred feet plus a few to adjust   
for climbing uphill,   
and her hands barely reach mine   
as we encircle the trunk,   
almost eleven feet around.   
Back to the lumber tables.   
That one tree might make   
three thousand feet of boards   
if our hearts could stand   
the sound of its fall.

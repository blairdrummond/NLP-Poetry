title : The Eight O Five

The t(rain) 
again this morning, sky always gray, 
grain cars f(lying) 
like blackbirds with fieldseed 
in their bellies. 

The eight o five carrying 
g(rain) 
sings like tribes 
when they migrated north in summer 
across the plains 
following tracks of herds. 

High water into trees. 
The lake full of rain. 
We say it is someone else 
pushing down on the lake 
to make it spill over its edge. 

While we wait 
the woman earth sings with the tribes, 
transforms herself 
into all things. 

After the train 
b(rush) burning, the delay of smoke 
in the car comes after 
we have passed like sound. 

Rain hangs fringe from earth womanâ€™s dress. 
She holds the delay of truth 
until it comes from our mouths. 

Coyotes sleep on her lap, 
birds fly into the b(ranches) of her hair 
while farther down the road 
the black snake train wiggles behind her ear.

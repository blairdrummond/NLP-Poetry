Free Verse

Your name is a--bird in my hand,
a piece of ice on my tongue.
The lips' quick opening.
Your name--four letters.
A ball caught in flight,
a silver bell in my mouth.

A stone thrown into a silent lake
is--the sound of your name.
The light click of hooves at night
--your name.
Your name at my temple
--sharp click of a cocked gun.

Your name--impossible--
kiss on my eyes,
the chill of closed eyelids.
Your name--a kiss of snow.
Blue gulp of icy spring water.
With your name--sleep deepens.

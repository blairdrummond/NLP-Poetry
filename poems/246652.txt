title : Ill-Advised Love Poem

author : John Yau

text : 
Come live with me 
And we will sit

Upon the rocks 
By shallow rivers

Come live with me 
And we will plant acorns

In each other's mouth 
It would be our way

Of greeting the earth 
Before it shoves us

Back into the snow 
Our interior cavities

Brimming with 
Disagreeable substances

Come live with me 
Before winter stops

To use the only pillow 
The sky ever sleeps on

Our interior cavities 
Brimming with snow

Come live with me 
Before spring

Swallows the air 
And birds sing

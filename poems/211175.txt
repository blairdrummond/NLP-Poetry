title : Frying Trout While Drunk

author : Lynn Emanuel

text : 
Mother is drinking to forget a man 
who could fill the woods with invitations:   
come with me he whispered and she went   
in his Nash Rambler, its dash 
where her knees turned green 
in the radium dials of the 50's. 
When I drink it is always 1953, 
bacon wilting in the pan on Cook Street   
and mother, wrist deep in red water,   
laying a trail from the sink 
to a glass of gin and back. 
She is a beautiful, unlucky woman 
in love with a man of lechery so solid   
you could build a table on it 
and when you did the blues would come to visit.   
I remember all of us awkwardly at dinner,   
the dark slung across the porch, 
and then mother’s dress falling to the floor,   
buttons ticking like seeds spit on a plate.   
When I drink I am too much like her—   
the knife in one hand and the trout   
with a belly white as my wrist.   
I have loved you all my life 
she told him and it was true 
in the same way that all her life 
she drank, dedicated to the act itself,   
she stood at this stove 
and with the care of the very drunk   
handed him the plate.

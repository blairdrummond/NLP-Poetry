title : After Suicide [A hole is nothing]

author : Matt Rasmussen

text : 
A hole is nothing
but what remains around it.

My brother stood
in the refrigerator light

drinking milk that poured 
out of his head

through thick black curls 
down his back into a puddle

growing larger around him. 
My body stood between the

living room and kitchen 
one foot on worn carpet

one on cold linoleum. 
He couldn't hear his name

clouding from my mouth 
settling in the fluorescent air.

I wanted to put my finger 
into the hole

feel the smooth channel 
he escaped through

stop the milk
so he could swallow it

but my body held
as if driven into place.

The milk on the floor 
reflected the light

then became it.
Floated upward and outward

filling every shadow 
blowing the dark open.

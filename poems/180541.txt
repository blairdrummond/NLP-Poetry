Don't be misled: 
that sea-song you hear 
when the shell's at your ear? 
It's all in your head. 

That primordial tide— 
the slurp and salt-slosh 
of the brain's briny wash— 
is on the inside. 

Truth be told, the whole place, 
everything that the eye 
can take in, to the sky 
and beyond into space, 

lives inside of your skull. 
When you set your sad head 
down on Procrustes' bed, 
you lay down the whole 

universe. You recline 
on the pillow: the cosmos 
grows dim. The soft ghost 
in the squishy machine, 

which the world is, retires. 
Someday it will expire. 
Then all will go silent 
and dark. For the moment, 

however, the black- 
ness is just temporary. 
The planet you carry 
will shortly swing back 

from the far nether regions. 
And life will continue— 
but only within you. 
Which raises a question 

that comes up again and again,   
as to why 
God would make ear and eye 
to face outward, not in?

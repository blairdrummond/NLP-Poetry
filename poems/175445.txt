title : One With The Sun

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
Child 
one with the sun 
in trackless fields 
of yellow grass and thistle, scent 
of humid heavy air and the wing music 
of bees and flies. 

Child, slender 
nakedness to itself unknown, 
true colour of the light 
dispersed invisibly 
or glowing around the black hulls 
of distant thunderheads, around 
the grasshopper’s countenance, 
solemn, vigilant and wise. 

Green apples, poured full 
of density, of crispness, float unmoved 
under leaves on the slope. Brown 
fallen apples nest 
in secret whorls of grass. The apple tree: 
alone in so much space. And below 
in the woods by the water 
a sweet dead branch 
cracks lightly 
in the shadow in the wind. 

But here is an old track 
through the grass head-high 
to a child: who 
made it? They must have 
passed and passed by this one tree, 
by the abandoned, tireless car 
where rabbits peer out, and the circle 
of black embers, 
cans, springs, skeletons 
of furniture. They too 
passed here many times 
on their way from the street’s end 
to the oaks that screen 
the river. There 
the sun is nesting now, night 
rises with pale flutterings 
of white wings from roots 
of plants and the black water.

title : The Farm

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
My father’s farm is an apple blossomer. 
He keeps his hills in dandelion carpet 
and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose 
and the jack-in-the-pulpits. 
His sleek cows ripple in the pastures. 
The dog and purple iris 
keep watch at the garden’s end. 

His farm is rolling thunder, 
a lightning bolt on the horizon. 
His crops suck rain from the sky 
and swallow the smoldering sun. 
His fields are oceans of heat, 
where waves of gold 
beat the burning shore. 

A red fox 
pauses under the birch trees, 
a shadow is in the river’s bend. 
When the hawk circles the land, 
my father’s grainfields whirl beneath it. 
Owls gather together to sing in his woods, 
and the deer run his golden meadow. 

My father’s farm is an icicle, 
a hillside of white powder. 
He parts the snowy sea, 
and smooths away the valleys. 
He cultivates his rows of starlight 
and drags the crescent moon 
through dark unfurrowed fields.

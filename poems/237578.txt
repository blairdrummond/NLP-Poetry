title : A Girl on the Swing

author : Chungmi Kim

text : 
She sees the mountain
 upside down.

 With her long hair
sweeping the fallen leaves
she swings
like a pendulum.

 From the lagoon at sunset
a hundred sparrows fly away.

 Wishing them back
 she whistles softly.
And downward
she falls into the sky.

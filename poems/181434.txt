title : November in the Former DDR

author : Tomas Tranströmer

text : 
The almighty cyclop’s-eye clouded over 
and the grass shook itself in the coal dust. 

Beaten black and blue by the night’s dreams 
we board the train 
that stops at every station 
and lays eggs. 

Almost silent. 
The clang of the church bells’ buckets 
fetching water. 
And someone’s inexorable cough 
scolding everything and everyone. 

A stone idol moves its lips: 
it’s the city. 
Ruled by iron-hard misunderstandings 
among kiosk attendants butchers 
metal-workers naval officers 
iron-hard misunderstandings, academics! 

How sore my eyes are! 
They’ve been reading by the faint glimmer of the glow-worm   lamps. 

November offers caramels of granite. 
Unpredictable! 
Like world history 
laughing at the wrong place. 

But we hear the clang 
of the church bells’ buckets fetching water 
every Wednesday 
- is it Wednesday? - 
so much for our Sundays!

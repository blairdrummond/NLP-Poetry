title : Remember

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
Remember 
The days of bondage— 
And remembering— 
Do not stand still. 
Go to the highest hill 
And look down upon the town 
Where you are yet a slave. 
Look down upon any town in Carolina 
Or any town in Maine, for that matter, 
Or Africa, your homeland— 
And you will see what I mean for you to see— 
             The white hand: 
             The thieving hand. 
             The white face: 
             The lying face. 
             The white power: 
             The unscrupulous power 
That makes of you 
The hungry wretched thing you are today.

title : Family Reunion

author : Louise Erdrich

text : 
Ray’s third new car in half as many years. 
Full cooler in the trunk, Ray sogging the beer 
as I solemnly chauffeur us through the bush 
and up the backroads, hardly cowpaths and hub-deep in mud.   
All day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again. 
Somewhere in the bush near Saint John 
there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother 
who stayed on the land when Ray left for the cities. 
One week Ray is crocked. We’ve been through this before.   
Even, as a little girl, hands in my dress, 
Ah punka, you’s my Debby, come and ki me. 
 

Then the road ends in a yard full of dogs. 
Them’s Indian dogs, Ray says, lookit how they know me.   
And they do seem to know him, like I do. His odor— 
rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from Metagoshe,   
and the inflammable mansmell: hair tonic, ashes, alcohol.   
Ray dances an old woman up in his arms. 
Fiddles reel in the phonograph and I sink apart 
in a corner, start knocking the Blue Ribbons down.   
Four generations of people live here. 
No one remembers Raymond Twobears. 

So what. The walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud   
sails back into the middle of Metagoshe. 
A three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline,   
so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in 
but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine. 
Then somehow Ray pries the beak open and shoves   
down a cherry bomb. Lights the string tongue. 

Headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper 
is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow’s soup. 
Ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in   
to sleep his own head off. Tomorrow I find 
that the animal has dragged itself off. 
I follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over 
into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh. 

Ray finds his way back through the room into his arms.   
When the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands   
and the boys and their old man fold him into the car 
where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks   
and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out. 

Somehow we find our way back. Uncle Ray   
sings an old song to the body that pulls him 
toward home. The gray fins that his hands have become   
screw their bones in the dashboard. His face   
has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always 
let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived   
for a long time underwater. And the angels come   
lowering their slings and litters.

title : Sad and Alone

author : Maurice Manning

text : 
Well, this is nothing new, nothing 
to rattle the rafters in the noggin, 

this moment of remembering 
and its kissing cousin the waking dream. 

I wonder if I'll remember it? 
I've had a vision of a woman 

reclining underneath a tree: 
she's about half naked and little by little 

I'm sprinkling her burial mounds 
with grass. This is the kind of work 

I like. It lets me remember, and so 
I do. I remember the time I laid 

my homemade banjo in the fire 
and let it burn. There was nothing else 

to burn and the house was cold; 
the cigar box curled inside the flames. 

But the burst of heat was over soon, 
and once the little roar was done, 

I could hear the raindrops plopping up 
the buckets and kettles, scattered out 

like little ponds around the room. 
It was night and I was a boy, alone 

and left to listen to that old music. 
I liked it. I've liked it ever since. 

I loved the helpless people I loved. 
That's what a little boy will do, 

but a grown man will turn it all 
to sadness and let it soak his heart 

until he wrings it out and dreams 
about another kind of love, 

some afternoon beneath a tree. 
Burial moundsâ€”that's hilarious.

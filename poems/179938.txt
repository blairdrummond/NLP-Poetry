title : End of Winter

author : Louise Glück

text : 
Over the still world, a bird calls 
waking solitary among black boughs. 

You wanted to be born; I let you be born. 
When has my grief ever gotten 
in the way of your pleasure? 

Plunging ahead 
into the dark and light at the same time 
eager for sensation 

as though you were some new thing, wanting 
to express yourselves 

all brilliance, all vivacity 

never thinking 
this would cost you anything, 
never imagining the sound of my voice 
as anything but part of you— 

you won't hear it in the other world, 
not clearly again, 
not in birdcall or human cry, 

not the clear sound, only 
persistent echoing 
in all sound that means good-bye, good-bye— 

the one continuous line 
that binds us to each other.

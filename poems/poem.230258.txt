Rhymed Stanza

D: The Dreadful Dinotherium he   
Will have to do his best for D.   
The early world observed with awe   
His back, indented like a saw. 
His look was gay, his voice was strong;   
His tail was neither short nor long;   
His trunk, or elongated nose, 
Was not so large as some suppose;   
His teeth, as all the world allows,   
Were graminivorous, like a cow's. 
He therefore should have wished to pass   
Long peaceful nights upon the Grass,   
But being mad the brute preferred 
To roost in branches, like a bird.1 
A creature heavier than a whale,   
You see at once, could hardly fail 
To suffer badly when he slid 
And tumbled (as he always did). 
His fossil, therefore, comes to light 
All broken up: and serve him right.

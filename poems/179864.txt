title : What the Leaf Told Me

author : Ronald Johnson

text : 
Today I saw the word written on the poplar leaves. 
 
It was ‘dazzle’. The dazzle of the poplars. 
 
 
As a leaf startles out 
 
 
from an undifferentiated mass of foliage, 
 
so the word did from a leaf— 
 
 
A Mirage Of The Delicate Polyglot 
 
inventing itself as cipher. But this, in shifts & gyrations, 
 
grew in brightness, so bright 
 
 
the massy poplars soon outshone the sun . . . 
 
 
‘My light—my dew—my breeze—my bloom’. Reflections 
 
 
In A Wren’s Eye.

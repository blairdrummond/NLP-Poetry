Processionals in the exemplary cave,   
Benediction of shadows. Pomfret. London.   
The voice fragrant with mannered humility,   
With an equable contempt for this world,   
‘In honorem Trinitatis’. Crash. The head   
Struck down into a meaty conduit of blood.   
So these dispose themselves to receive each   
Pentecostal blow from axe or seraph,   
Spattering block-straw with mortal residue.   
Psalteries whine through the empyrean. Fire   
Flares in the pit, ghosting upon stone   
Creatures of such rampant state, vacuous   
Ceremony of possession, restless 
Habitation, no man’s dwelling-place.

For whom do we scrape our tribute of pain—   
For none but the ritual king? We meditate   
A rueful mystery; we are dying 
To satisfy fat Caritas, those 
Wiped jaws of stone. (Suppose all reconciled   
By silent music; imagine the future 
Flashed back at us, like steel against sun,   
Ultimate recompense.) Recall the cold 
Of Towton on Palm Sunday before dawn,   
Wakefield, Tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets   
Shrilling into the ruck; some trampled   
Acres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet, 
Stuck with strange-postured dead. Recall the wind’s   
Flurrying, darkness over the human mire.

They bespoke doomsday and they meant it by   
God, their curved metal rimming the low ridge.   
But few appearances are like this. Once 
Every five hundred years a comet’s 
Over-riding stillness might reveal men 
In such array, livid and featureless, 
With England crouched beastwise beneath it all.   
‘Oh, that old northern business …’ A field   
After battle utters its own sound 
Which is like nothing on earth, but is earth.   
Blindly the questing snail, vulnerable 
Mole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly   
Among carnage the most delicate souls 
Tup in their marriage-blood, gasping ‘Jesus’.

Let mind be more precious than soul; it will not   
Endure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace,   
Settles with tears and sweat, is possibly   
Indestructible. That I can believe.   
Though I would scorn the mere instinct of faith,   
Expediency of assent, if I dared,   
What I dare not is a waste history   
Or void rule. Averroes, old heathen,   
If only you had been right, if Intellect   
Itself were absolute law, sufficient grace,   
Our lives could be a myth of captivity   
Which we might enter: an unpeopled region   
Of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing   
With perpetual silence as with torches.

As with torches we go, at wild Christmas,   
When we revel in our atonement 
Through thirty feasts of unction and slaughter,   
What is that but the soul’s winter sleep?   
So many things rest under consummate   
Justice as though trumpets purified law,   
Spikenard were the real essence of remorse.   
The sky gathers up darkness. When we chant   
‘Ora, ora pro nobis’ it is not 
Seraphs who descend to pity but ourselves.   
Those righteously-accused those vengeful   
Racked on articulate looms indulge us   
With lingering shows of pain, a flagrant   
Tenderness of the damned for their own flesh:

My little son, when you could command marvels   
Without mercy, outstare the wearisome 
Dragon of sleep, I rejoiced above all— 
A stranger well-received in your kingdom.   
On those pristine fields I saw humankind   
As it was named by the Father; fabulous 
Beasts rearing in stillness to be blessed. 
The world’s real cries reached there, turbulence   
From remote storms, rumour of solitudes,   
A composed mystery. And so it ends. 
Some parch for what they were; others are made   
Blind to all but one vision, their necessity   
To be reconciled. I believe in my 
Abandonment, since it is what I have.

‘Prowess, vanity, mutual regard, 
It seemed I stared at them, they at me. 
That was the gorgon’s true and mortal gaze:   
Averted conscience turned against itself.’ 
A hawk and a hawk-shadow. ‘At noon, 
As the armies met, each mirrored the other;   
Neither was outshone. So they flashed and vanished   
And all that survived them was the stark ground   
Of this pain. I made no sound, but once 
I stiffened as though a remote cry 
Had heralded my name. It was nothing …’ 
Reddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few   
Feathers drifted across; carrion birds 
Strutted upon the armour of the dead.

Not as we are but as we must appear,   
Contractual ghosts of pity; not as we   
Desire life but as they would have us live,   
Set apart in timeless colloquy. 
So it is required; so we bear witness,   
Despite ourselves, to what is beyond us,   
Each distant sphere of harmony forever   
Poised, unanswerable. If it is without   
Consequence when we vaunt and suffer, or   
If it is not, all echoes are the same   
In such eternity. Then tell me, love,   
How that should comfort us—or anyone   
Dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place, 
Crying to the end ‘I have not finished’.

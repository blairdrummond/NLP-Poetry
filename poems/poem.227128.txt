Living, Death

Rhymed Stanza

This little vault, this narrow room, 
Of Love, and Beauty, is the tomb; 
The dawning beam that gan to clear 
Our clouded sky, lies darken'd here, 
Forever set to us, by death 
Sent to inflame the world beneath. 
'Twas but a bud, yet did contain 
More sweetness than shall spring again; 
A budding star that might have grown 
Into a sun, when it had blown. 
This hopeful beauty did create 
New life in Love's declining state; 
But now his empire ends, and we 
From fire and wounding darts are free; 
His brand, his bow, let no man fear, 
The flames, the arrows, all lie here.

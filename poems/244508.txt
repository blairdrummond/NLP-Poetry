title : Mules

text : 
When they told us Don’t speak until spoken to, we grew
 ears the size of corn.
  
 When they forced us to eat everything we swallowed
 their hurt whole.
  
 When they hit us for drawing on the wall we painted
 doors that opened behind curtains.
  
 For generations they lived like this. Wanting badly to
 save us—not knowing how.
  
 & all the while we found love in unlikely places: In
 the ravaged church of our bodies & our faces,
  
 refracted in their long faces.

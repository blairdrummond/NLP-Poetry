At times now from some margin of the day
 I can hear birds of another country
 not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
 out of a music that I may have heard
 once in a moment I appear to have
 forgotten for the most part that full day
 no sight of which I can remember now
 though it must have been where my eyes were then
 that knew it as the present while I thought
 of somewhere else without noticing that
 singing when it was there and still went on
 whether or not I noticed now it falls
 silent when I listen and leaves the day
 and flies before it to be heard again
 somewhere ahead when I have forgotten

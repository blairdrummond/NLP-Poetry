title : Fable for a War

author : Thomas James Merton

text : 
The old Roman sow   
Bears a new litter now 
To fatten for a while 
On the same imperial swill. 
The cannibal wolf will dig 
And root out Spanish bones beside the pig. 

Germany has reared   
A rare ugly bird 
To screech a sour song   
In the German tongue:   
Tell me if there be 
A sparrowhawk for such birds as he? 

The parrots lift their beaks 
And fill the air with shrieks. 
Ambassador is sent 
From the parrots’ parliament: 
“Oh see how fine I fly 
And nibble crackers got in Germany.” 

Europe is a feast 
For every bloody beast:   
Jackals will grow fat   
On the bones after that.   
But in the end of all 
None but the crows can sing the funeral. 

Germany has reared 
A rare ugly bird, 
But crows ate Roman pig 
Before this bird was egg. 
And in the end of all 
Crows will come back and sing the funeral.

title : The Beautiful Animal

author : Geoffrey Brock

text : 
By the time I recalled that it is also 
terrifying, we had gone too far into 
the charmed woods to return. It was then 

the beautiful animal appeared in our path: 
ribs jutting, moon-fed eyes moving 
from me to you and back. If we show 

none of the fear, it may tire of waiting 
for the triggering flight, it may ask only 
to lie between us and sleep, fur warm 

on our skin, breath sweet on our necks 
as it dreams of slaughter, as we dream 
alternately of feeding and taming it 

and of being the first to run. The woods 
close tight around us, lying nested here 
like spoons in a drawer of knives, to see 

who wakes first, and from which dream.

I’ll go anywhere to leave you but come with me. 
All the cities are like you anyway. Windows 
darken when I get close enough to see. 
Any place we want to stay’s polluted, 

the good spots taken already by those 
who ruin them. And restaurants we’d never find. 
We’d rut a ditch by a river in nights 
so long they must be cut by the many pairs 

of wrong-handled scissors maybe god owns 
and doesn’t share. I water god. 
I make a haunted lake and rinse and rinse. 
I take what I want, and have ever since what 

I want disappeared, like anything hunted. 
That’s what you said. Disappointment 
isn’t tender, dried and wide instead. 
The tourists snapped you crying, 

and the blanket I brought was so dirty 
it must have been lying around 
in lice and blood that whole year we fought. 
It wasn’t clear, so I forgot.

I haven’t been sleeping, next to you 
twitching to bury my boring eyes. 
The ship made you sad, and the ferry, and canoe. 
All boats do.

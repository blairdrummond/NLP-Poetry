We pull off 
to a road shack 
in Massachusetts 
to watch men walk 

on the moon. We did   
the same thing 
for three two one 
blast off, and now 

we watch the same men   
bounce in and out 
of craters. I want 
a Coke and a hamburger. 

Because the men 
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green, not cheese, 

not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue, 
the way I'd thought, 
the road shack people don't 

notice we are a black   
family not from there,   
the way it mostly goes.   
This talking through 

static, bounces in space- 
boots, tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger, stranger 

even than we are.

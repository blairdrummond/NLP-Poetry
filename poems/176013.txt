title : mulberry fields

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
they thought the field was wasting 
and so they gathered the marker rocks and stones and 
piled them into a barn    they say that the rocks were shaped 
some of them scratched with triangles and other forms    they 
must have been trying to invent some new language they say 
the rocks went to build that wall there guarding the manor and 
some few were used for the state house 
crops refused to grow 
i say the stones marked an old tongue and it was called eternity 
and pointed toward the river    i say that after that collection 
no pillow in the big house dreamed    i say that somewhere under 
here moulders one called alice whose great grandson is old now 
too and refuses to talk about slavery    i say that at the 
masters table only one plate is set for supper    i say no seed 
can flourish on this ground once planted then forsaken    wild 
berries warm a field of bones 
bloom how you must i say

title : The Country Autumns

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
But it could not be brought to see what it
 could be brought. And the leaves are
 away again, teamed. A parent at the
 last and a parent in the middle. And
 as stones I thought it right.

Two plates, and on the other side all the
 forest pieces. The clock says stay.
 The books lower the earth, and in gardens
 flat stones spin. The volume was of waiting.
 Today is today, until the preposition taken up.
 Next to the tree sways.
 Â 
The sky in pieces the leaves part the
 leaves piece together. To and from a hand
 given all directions. The bark comes from
 below. Takes from the books of the moves under
 the sky. Speaker holds up the talks held last.
 Motors the dust and the yellow syllables.
 A slant on which was never here or 
 only partly.

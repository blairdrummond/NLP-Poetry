                            1

   Indeed I must confess,
   When souls mix 'tis an happiness,
But not complete till bodies too do join,
And both our wholes into one whole combine;
But half of heaven the souls in glory taste
   Till by love in heaven at last 
   Their bodies too are placed.

                            2

   In thy immortal part
   Man, as well as I, thou art.
But something 'tis that differs thee and me,
And we must one even in that difference be.
I thee both as a man and woman prize,
   For a perfect love implies
   Love in all capacities.

                            3

   Can that for true love pass
   When a fair woman courts her glass?
Something unlike must in love's likeness be:
His wonder is one and variety.
For he whose soul nought but a soul can move
   Does a new Narcissus prove,
   And his own image love.

                            4

   That souls do beauty know
   'Tis to the body's help they owe;
If when they know't they straight abuse that trust
And shut the body from't, 'tis as unjust
As if I brought my dearest friend to see
   My mistress and at th'instant he
   Should steal her quite from me.

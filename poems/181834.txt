title : A Secret Matter of Grave Importance

text : 
Except when once we drew identical lots 
nothing’s ever come between us. 
We keep our drifts of space 
spare and daily shake our down. 

You’ve glanced beyond your dirty cuffs 
and caught me hand-washing my clean shirts. 
Stuck with sharp wind, both 
bloods are rare and rarely do 

we taste the walnut’s knot of oil. 
We wake between our fitted sheets 
and shake our fists or pretend real fright 
but not in this do we dare touch. 

My rib cage can stand in yours, yours 
become the swinging doors through which 
magician’s swords will slice and miss 
that knotted muscle. It is a trick. 

We’ll make an endless show of the outright 
clanking, irregular beating of our acrobatic hearts. 
We’ve designed the double bars of depth; 
our hearts skip — the tumbleset we think 

is absence, the somersault we call forbearance 
— the hearts are there, doing turns that teach 
us to count and keep each finger 
close to its own sly pulse.

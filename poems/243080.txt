title : Monologue of a Commercial Fisherman

author : Alan Dugan

text : 
“If you work a body of water and a body of woman
 you can take fish out of one and children out of the other
 for the two kinds of survival. The fishing is good,
 both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield,
 but the hard work and the miseries are killing;
 it is a good life if life is good. If not, not.
 You are out in the world and in in the world,
 having it both ways: it is sportive and prevenient living
 combined, although you have to think about the weathers
 and the hard work and the miseries are what I said.
 It runs on like water, quickly, under the boat,
 then slowly like the sand dunes under the house.
 You survive by yourself by the one fish for a while
 and then by the other afterward when you run out.
 You run out a hooky life baited with good times,
 and whether the catch is caught or not is a question
 for those who go fishing for men or among them for things.”

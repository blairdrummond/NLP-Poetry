title : Psychoanalysis of Water

author : Forrest Gander

text : 
The clock here is quiet.   
Into the rain’s applause,   
a woman rises 
fatigued. Tablets 
dissolve in a glass by the bed.   
The wind lifts, branches   
animating inconsonant darkness. 
She undoes her gown,   
lays it over the bedpost.   
Seductive leg hair. Almost 
dawn, she makes coffee like that. 

Low thunder, glints 
of lightning, the dog’s 
concern. Rain on the roof,   
friends walking across my grave,   
her mother told her, that’s all   
I listen for. 
And why not the hiss and wake   
of cars on the wet road 
bursting into transparence under tents   
of streetlight, winking out   
into afterglow. Glances that catch   
anonymous faces at windows   
in early lit houses like her own. 

This way she drifts off, mesmerically.   
The bathtub overflowing.

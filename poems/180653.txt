title : Love Me Little, Love Me Long

text : 
Love me little, love me long, 
Is the burden of my song. 
Love that is too hot and strong 
    Burneth soon to waste: 
Still, I would not have thee cold, 
Not too backward, nor too bold; 
Love that lasteth till ’tis old 
    Fadeth not in haste. 
         Love me little, love me long, 
         Is the burden of my song. 

If thou lovest me too much 
It will not prove as true as touch; 
Love me little, more than such, 
    For I fear the end: 
I am with little well content, 
And a little from thee sent 
Is enough, with true intent 
    To be steadfast friend. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song. 

Say thou lov’st me while thou live; 
I to thee my love will give, 
never dreaming to deceive 
    Whiles that life endures: 
Nay, and after death, in sooth, 
I too thee will keep my truth, 
As now, when in my May of youth: 
    This my love assures. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden on my song. 

Constant love is moderate ever, 
And it will through life persèver: 
Give me that, with true endeavour 
    I will it restore. 
A suit of durance let it be 
For all weathers that for me, 
For the land or for the sea, 
    Lasting evermore. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song. 

Winter’s cold, or summer’s heat, 
Autumn’s tempests, on it beat, 
It can never know defeat, 
    Never can rebel: 
Such the love that I would gain, 
Such the love, I tell thee plain, 
Thou must give, or woo in vain: 
    So to thee, farewell 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song.

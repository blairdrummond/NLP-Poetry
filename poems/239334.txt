title : Crochet

author : Jan Mordenski

text : 
Even after darkness closed her eyes  
my mother could crochet.  
Her hands would walk the rows of wool  
turning, bending, to a woolen music.

The dye lots were registered in memory:  
appleskin, chocolate, porcelain pan,  
the stitches remembered like faded rhymes:  
pineapple, sunflower, window pane, shell.

Tied to our lives those past years  
by merely a soft colored yarn,  
she’d sit for hours, her dark lips  
moving as if reciting prayers,  
coaching the sighted hands.

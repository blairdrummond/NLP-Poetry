title : Soft Spots

author : Jason Guriel

text : 
They’re worse than weak links 
in chains, which we can blame 
on blacksmiths’ fire, and chinks 
in armor, made by rain 

of arrows. Soft spots, 
those parts of us that bruise, 
prove we’re fruit that rots 
as hourglasses ooze. 

But I’ve a soft spot for, 
a phrase we tend to whisper, 
is what we say before 
we name our guilty pleasure— 

the damper pedal that pounds 
sonatas into mush 
the critic Ezra Pound 
would call, with a shudder, slush.

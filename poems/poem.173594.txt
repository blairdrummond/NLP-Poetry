Rhymed Stanza

"Had he and I but met 
            By some old ancient inn, 
We should have sat us down to wet 
            Right many a nipperkin! 

            "But ranged as infantry, 
            And staring face to face, 
I shot at him as he at me, 
            And killed him in his place. 

            "I shot him dead because -- 
            Because he was my foe, 
Just so: my foe of course he was; 
            That's clear enough; although 

            "He thought he'd 'list, perhaps, 
            Off-hand like -- just as I -- 
Was out of work -- had sold his traps -- 
            No other reason why. 

            "Yes; quaint and curious war is! 
            You shoot a fellow down 
You'd treat if met where any bar is, 
            Or help to half-a-crown."

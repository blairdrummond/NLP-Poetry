title : Insomnia

author : Dana Gioia

text : 
Now you hear what the house has to say.   
Pipes clanking, water running in the dark,   
the mortgaged walls shifting in discomfort,   
and voices mounting in an endless drone 
of small complaints like the sounds of a family   
that year by year you’ve learned how to ignore.

But now you must listen to the things you own,   
all that you’ve worked for these past years,   
the murmur of property, of things in disrepair,   
the moving parts about to come undone,   
and twisting in the sheets remember all 
the faces you could not bring yourself to love. 

How many voices have escaped you until now,   
the venting furnace, the floorboards underfoot,   
the steady accusations of the clock 
numbering the minutes no one will mark.   
The terrible clarity this moment brings,   
the useless insight, the unbroken dark.

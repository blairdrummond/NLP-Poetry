I.
  
 I hate, I love, I don’t know how
 I’m biracial, I’m torn in two
  
 Tonight, he will lock me in fear
 In the metal detector of love
  
 Rapeflowers, rapeseeds, rapiers
 A soldier’s wry offerings
  
 He will press his tongue
 Into my neighing throat
  
 I can speak three dialects badly
 I want you now behind the blue door
  
 In a slow hovercraft of dreams
 I saw Nanking from a bilge
  
 Some ashes fell on his lap
 I’m afraid it’s my mother
  
 The protocol is never to mention her
 While we are fucking
  
  
 II.
  
 The bad conceit, the bad conceit police will arrest you
 Twin compasses, twin compasses cannot come
  
 Your father is not a car, not a compass and not God
 Though he vanished in his sky-blue convertible Galaxy with a blonde
  
 He kept crawling back to us, back to us
 Each time with a fresh foot mangled
  
 One emperor was named Lickety, the other named Split
 Suddenly, the soup of chaos makes sense
  
 Refugees roaming from tent to tent to tent, looking for love
 The banknote is a half note, an octave above God
  
 O the great conjugator of curses: shit, shat, have shut!
 I have loved you both bowl-cut and shagged
  
 There are days when the sun is a great gash
 Nights, the moon smokes hashish and falls asleep on your lap
  
 Sorry, but your morphing was not satisfactory
 Shapeshifter, you choked on your magic scarf
  
  
 III.
  
 I heard this joke at the bar
 An agnostic dyslexic insomniac stayed up all night searching for doG
  
 The prosperity sign flips right side up again
 The Almanac says this Ox Year we’ll toil like good immigrants
  
 Horse is frigid. Mule can’t love
 Salmon dead at the redd
  
 One leg is stationary, the other must tread, must tread, must tread
 The Triads riddled him, then us
  
 What is the heart’s past participle?
 She would have loved not to have loved
  
 I bought you at the corner of Agave and Revolucíon
 You wrapped yourself thrice around my green arm and shat!
  
 A childless woman can feel the end of all existence
 Look, on that bloody spot, Chrysanthemum!
  
 Shamanka, fetch your grandmother at the bus stop
 Changeling, you are the one I love

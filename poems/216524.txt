title : Your Clothes

author : Judith Kroll

text : 
Of course they are empty shells, without hope of animation. 
Of course they are artifacts. 

Even if my sister and I should wear some, 
or if we give others away, 

they will always be your clothes without you, 
as we will always be your daughters without you.

You can say the broken word but cannot speak 
for it, can name a precise and particular shade 
of blue if you can remember its name 
(Woman of the South, New Lilac, Second Sky?) 

As the light, close to blinding, fell—falls 
in bars across a particular page, this 
then another, some other 
followed far too closely by night 

Or as the sleeping 
pages recall themselves, one by one, 
in dream-riddled, guarded tones, 
recall themselves from path 

to sloped meadow, meadow 
to burnt shore, shore 
to poised wave, dismay 
to present, any present 

of the bewildered and the buried alive 
(we’ve been told they were buried alive) 
Is there a door he hasn’t noticed 
and beyond it a letter which created the door 

or claims it created a door 
which would open either way

title : Duns Scotus's Oxford

author : Gerard Manley Hopkins

text : 
Towery city and branchy between towers; 
Cuckoo-echoing, bell-swarmèd, lark charmèd, rook racked, river-rounded; 
The dapple-eared lily below thee; that country and town did 
Once encounter in, here coped & poisèd powers; 

Thou hast a base and brickish skirt there, sours 
That neighbour-nature thy grey beauty is grounded 
Best in; graceless growth, thou hast confounded 
Rural, rural keeping — folk, flocks, and flowers. 

Yet ah! this air I gather and I release 
He lived on; these weeds and waters, these walls are what 
He haunted who of all men most sways my spirits to peace; 

Of realty the rarest-veinèd unraveller; a not 
Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or Greece; 
Who fired France for Mary without spot.

title : Evening

author : H. D.

text : 
The light passes 
from ridge to ridge, 
from flower to flower— 
the hepaticas, wide-spread 
under the light 
grow faint— 
the petals reach inward, 
the blue tips bend 
toward the bluer heart 
and the flowers are lost. 

The cornel-buds are still white, 
but shadows dart 
from the cornel-roots— 
black creeps from root to root, 
each leaf 
cuts another leaf on the grass, 
shadow seeks shadow, 
then both leaf 
and leaf-shadow are lost.

text : 
Because I am not married, I have the skin of an orange
  
 that has spent its life in the dark. Inside the orange I am blind.
 I cannot tell when a hand reaches in and breaks
  
 the atoms of the blood. Sometimes a blackbird will bring the wind
  
 into my hair. Or the yellow clouds falling on the cold floor
 are animals fighting each other
  
 out of their drifting misery. All the women I have known
  
 have been ruined by fog and the deer crossing the field at night.

title : The Measure of the Year

author : James Galvin

text : 
A canoe made of horse ribs tipped over in the pasture. 
Prairie flowers took it for a meetinghouse. 
They grow there with a vengeance. 

Buck posts float across the flooded swamp 
Where my father rode in and under. 
Different horse. 

He held her head up out of the mud 
And said how he was sorry 
Till they came to pull him out. 

We found the white filly 
On the only hard ground by the south gate. 
He said she’d been a ghost from the start and he was right. 

We covered her with branches. 
There were things he had the wrong names for 
Like rose crystals. Though 

They were about what you’d think from a name like that. 
He told us somewhere on Sand Creek Pass 
Was a crystal that spelled our own initials 

And we should try to find it. 
We walked through sagebrush and sand currents, looking. 
He said pasqueflowers and paintbrush 

Wait till Easter to grow, 
Then they come up even with snow still on the ground. 
I thought I’d seen that happen.

title : Baghdad Song

author : Ibn Al-`Arabi

text : 
Oh, for corniced palace of Baghdad! not 
the palatial cornices of Sindád al-Híra— 

It crowns the gardens cascading below,   
a virgin unveiled in a perfumed chamber. 

Wind plays in the branches. They bend. 
Lovers at last coming together. 

Her neck necklaced by the river Tigris, 
her lord our master our Imám al-Hádi, 

Násir, Mansúr, best of caliphs, 
who never set out on horseback to war. 

God bless him long   
as a dove on a swaying bough's cooing, 

Long as smiles flash lightning 
(and eyes stream like clouds in answer) 

From a bride like the sun when the mist parts, 
revealing herself luminous in splendor.

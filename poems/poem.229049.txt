Sonnet

The longe love that in my thought doth harbour 
And in mine hert doth keep his residence, 
Into my face presseth with bold pretence 
And therein campeth, spreading his banner. 
She that me learneth to love and suffer 
And will that my trust and lustes negligence 
Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence, 
With his hardiness taketh displeasure. 
Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth, 
Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry, 
And there him hideth and not appeareth. 
What may I do when my master feareth 
But in the field with him to live and die? 
For good is the life ending faithfully.

Eventually we must combine nightmares 
an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps 
of the last national bank, said to me.
I put her out with my thumb. I don’t need that 
cheap talk I’ve got my own problems. 
It was sad, exciting, and horrible. 
It was exciting, horrible, and sad. 
It was horrible, sad, and exciting. 
It was inviting, mad, and deplorable. 
It was adorable, glad, and enticing. 
Eventually we must smoke a thumb 
cheap talk I’ve got my own angel 
on the steps of the problems the bank 
said to me I don’t need that. 
I will take this one window
with its sooty maps and scratches 
so that my dreams will remember
one another and so that my eyes will not 
become blinded by the new world.

The flames don’t dance or slither. 
They have painted the room green. 
Beautiful and naked, the wives 
are sleeping before the fire. 
Now it is out. The men have 
returned to the shacks,
slaved creatures from the forest 
floor across their white
stationwagons. That just about 
does it, says the other,
dumping her bucket
over her head. Well, I guess
we got everything, says one, 
feeling around in the mud, 
as if for a child.
Now they remember they want 
that mud, who can’t remember 
what they got up for.
They parcel it out: when
they are drunk enough
they go into town with
a bucket of mud, saying
we can slice it up into
windmills like a bloated cow.
Later, they paint the insides 
of the shack black,
and sit sucking eggs all night, 
they want something real, useful, 
but there isn’t anything.

I will engineer the sunrise
they have disassembled our shadows 
our echoes are erased from the walls 
your nipples are the skeletons of olives 
your nipples are an oriental delight
your nipples blow away like cigarette papers 
your nipples are the mouths of mutes 
so I am not here any longer
skein of lightning
memory’s dark ink in your last smile
where the stars have swallowed their train schedule 
where the stars have drowned in their dark petticoats 
like a sock of hamburger
receiving the lightning
into his clitoris
red on red the prisoner
confesses his waltz
through the corkscrew lightning 
nevermind the lightning
in your teeth let’s waltz
I am the hashish pinball machine 
that rapes a piano.

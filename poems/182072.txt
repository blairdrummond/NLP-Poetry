title : Night-Piece

text : 
I saw within the shadows of the yard the shed 
and saw the snow upon its roof— 
an oblong glowing in the moonlit night. 

I could not rest or close my eyes, 
although I knew that I must rise 
early next morning and begin my work again, 
and begin my work again. 

That day was lost—that month as well; 
and year and year for all that I can tell.

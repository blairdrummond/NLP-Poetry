Master of the murmuring courts 
      Where the shapes of sleep convene!-- 
Lo! my spirit here exhorts 
      All the powers of thy demesne 
      For their aid to woo my queen. 
          What reports 
      Yield thy jealous courts unseen? 

   Vaporous, unaccountable, 
      Dreamland lies forlorn of light, 
Hollow like a breathing shell. 
      Ah! that from all dreams I might 
      Choose one dream and guide its flight! 
          I know well 
      What her sleep should tell to-night. 

   There the dreams are multitudes: 
      Some that will not wait for sleep, 
Deep within the August woods; 
      Some that hum while rest may steep 
      Weary labour laid a-heap; 
          Interludes, 
      Some, of grievous moods that weep. 

   Poets' fancies all are there: 
      There the elf-girls flood with wings 
Valleys full of plaintive air; 
      There breathe perfumes; there in rings 
      Whirl the foam-bewildered springs; 
          Siren there 
      Winds her dizzy hair and sings. 

   Thence the one dream mutually 
      Dreamed in bridal unison, 
Less than waking ecstasy; 
      Half-formed visions that make moan 
      In the house of birth alone; 
          And what we 
      At death's wicket see, unknown. 

   But for mine own sleep, it lies 
      In one gracious form's control, 
Fair with honourable eyes, 
      Lamps of a translucent soul: 
      O their glance is loftiest dole, 
          Sweet and wise, 
      Wherein Love descries his goal. 

   Reft of her, my dreams are all 
      Clammy trance that fears the sky: 
Changing footpaths shift and fall; 
      From polluted coverts nigh, 
      Miserable phantoms sigh; 
          Quakes the pall, 
      And the funeral goes by. 

   Master, is it soothly said 
      That, as echoes of man's speech 
Far in secret clefts are made, 
      So do all men's bodies reach 
      Shadows o'er thy sunken beach,-- 
          Shape or shade 
      In those halls pourtrayed of each? 

   Ah! might I, by thy good grace 
      Groping in the windy stair, 
(Darkness and the breath of space 
      Like loud waters everywhere,) 
      Meeting mine own image there 
          Face to face, 
      Send it from that place to her! 

   Nay, not I; but oh! do thou, 
      Master, from thy shadowkind 
Call my body's phantom now: 
      Bid it bear its face declin'd 
      Till its flight her slumbers find, 
          And her brow 
      Feel its presence bow like wind. 

   Where in groves the gracile Spring 
      Trembles, with mute orison 
Confidently strengthening, 
      Water's voice and wind's as one 
      Shed an echo in the sun. 
          Soft as Spring, 
      Master, bid it sing and moan. 

   Song shall tell how glad and strong 
      Is the night she soothes alway; 
Moan shall grieve with that parched tongue 
      Of the brazen hours of day: 
      Sounds as of the springtide they, 
          Moan and song, 
      While the chill months long for May. 

   Not the prayers which with all leave 
      The world's fluent woes prefer,-- 
Not the praise the world doth give, 
      Dulcet fulsome whisperer;-- 
      Let it yield my love to her, 
          And achieve 
      Strength that shall not grieve or err. 

   Wheresoe'er my dreams befall, 
      Both at night-watch, (let it say,) 
And where round the sundial 
      The reluctant hours of day, 
      Heartless, hopeless of their way, 
          Rest and call;-- 
      There her glance doth fall and stay. 

   Suddenly her face is there: 
      So do mounting vapours wreathe 
Subtle-scented transports where 
      The black firwood sets its teeth. 
      Part the boughs and look beneath,-- 
          Lilies share 
      Secret waters there, and breathe. 

   Master, bid my shadow bend 
      Whispering thus till birth of light, 
Lest new shapes that sleep may send 
      Scatter all its work to flight;-- 
      Master, master of the night, 
          Bid it spend 
      Speech, song, prayer, and end aright. 

   Yet, ah me! if at her head 
      There another phantom lean 
Murmuring o'er the fragrant bed,-- 
      Ah! and if my spirit's queen 
      Smile those alien prayers between,-- 
          Ah! poor shade! 
      Shall it strive, or fade unseen? 

   How should love's own messenger 
      Strive with love and be love's foe? 
Master, nay! If thus, in her, 
      Sleep a wedded heart should show,-- 
      Silent let mine image go, 
          Its old share 
      Of thy spell-bound air to know. 

   Like a vapour wan and mute, 
      Like a flame, so let it pass; 
One low sigh across her lute, 
      One dull breath against her glass; 
      And to my sad soul, alas! 
          One salute 
      Cold as when Death's foot shall pass. 

   Then, too, let all hopes of mine, 
      All vain hopes by night and day, 
Slowly at thy summoning sign 
      Rise up pallid and obey. 
      Dreams, if this is thus, were they:-- 
          Be they thine, 
      And to dreamworld pine away. 

   Yet from old time, life, not death, 
      Master, in thy rule is rife: 
Lo! through thee, with mingling breath, 
      Adam woke beside his wife. 
      O Love bring me so, for strife, 
          Force and faith, 
      Bring me so not death but life! 

   Yea, to Love himself is pour'd 
      This frail song of hope and fear. 
Thou art Love, of one accord 
      With kind Sleep to bring her near, 
      Still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how dear. 
          Master, Lord, 
      In her name implor'd, O hear!

title : Nude Descending a Staircase

author : X J Kennedy

text : 
Toe after toe, a snowing flesh, 
a gold of lemon, root and rind, 
she sifts in sunlight down the stairs 
with nothing on. Nor on her mind. 

We spy beneath the banister 
a constant thresh of thigh on thigh; 
her lips imprint the swinging air 
that parts to let her parts go by. 
    
One-woman waterfall, she wears 
her slow descent like a long cape 
and pausing on the final stair, 
collects her motions into shape.

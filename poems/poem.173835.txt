Sonnet, Ode

There is delight in singing, tho' none hear 
Beside the singer; and there is delight 
In praising, tho' the praiser sit alone 
And see the prais'd far off him, far above. 
Shakspeare is not our poet, but the world's, 
Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, 
Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, 
No man hath walkt along our roads with step 
So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue 
So varied in discourse. But warmer climes 
Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze 
Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on 
Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where 
The Siren waits thee, singing song for song.

text : 
You don’t listen to what I say.   
When I lean towards you in the car   
You simply smile and turn away. 

It’s been like this most of the day,   
sitting and sipping, bar after bar:   
You don’t listen to what I say. 

You squeeze a lemon from a tray,   
And if you guess how dear you are   
You simply smile and turn away. 

Beyond the hairline of the bay   
the steamers call that shore is far.   
You don’t listen to what I say: 

Surely there’s another way? 
The waiter brings a small guitar.   
You simply smile and turn away. 

Sometimes I think you are too gay,   
smiling and smiling, hour after hour.   
You don’t listen to what I say. 
You simply smile and turn away.

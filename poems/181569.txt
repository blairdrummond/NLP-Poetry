title : Letter 7

author : Michael Palmer

text : 
But the buried walls and our mouths of fragments, 
no us but the snow staring at us . . . 

And you Mr. Ground-of_what, Mr. Text, Mr. Is-Was, 
can you calculate the ratio between wire and window, 

between tone and row, copula and carnival 
and can you reassemble light from the future-past 

in its parabolic nest 
or recite an entire winter’s words, 

its liberties and psuedo-elegies, 
the shell of a street-car in mid-turn 

or scattered fires in the great hall 
I would say not-I here I’d say The Book of Knots 

I’d say undertows and currents and waterspouts, 
streaks of phosphorus and rivervine winds 

Dear Z, I’d say it’s time, it’s nearly time, it’s almost, it’s 
       just about, it’s long 
past time now time now for the vex- for the vox- for the 
       voices of shadows, 

time for the prism letters, trinkets and shrouds, 
for a whirl in gauzy scarves around the wrecked piazza 

Messieurs-Dames, Meine Herren und Damen, our word-ballon, 
       you will note, is slowly 
rising over the parched city, 

its catacombs, hospitals and experimental gardens, 
its toll-gates, ghettos and ring-roads, 

narcoleptics and therapists and stray cats 
Ladies and Gentleen, our menu for this flight, 

due to temporary shortages, 
will be an alpha-omega soup, Bactrian hump, and nun’s farts 

As we enter the seventh sphere, you will discover a thin 
layer of ice just beginning 

to form on your limbs 
Do not be alarmed, this is normal 

You will experience difficulty breathing, this is normal 
The breathing you experience is difficulty, this is normal 

Dear Z, Should I say space 
constructed of echoes, rifts, mirrors, a strange 

year for touring the interior 
Should I say double dance, Horn, axis and wheel 

Dear A, Scuttled ships are clogging the harbors 
and their cargoes lie rotting on the piers 

Prepare executions and transfusions 
Put on your latest gear

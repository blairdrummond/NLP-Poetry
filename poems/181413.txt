title : Three Teenage Girls: 1956

Three teenage girls in tight red sleeveless blouses and black Capri pants   
And colorful headscarves secured in a knot to their chins   
Are walking down the hill, chatting, laughing,   
Cupping their cigarettes against the light rain,   
The closest to the road with her left thumb stuck out   
Not looking at the cars going past.   

Every Friday night to the dance, and wet or dry   
They get where they’re going, walk two miles or get a ride,   
And now the two-door 1950 Dodge, dark green   
Darkening as evening falls, stops, they nudge   
Each other, peer in, shrug, two scramble into the back seat,   
And the third, the boldest, famous   
For twice running away from home, slides in front with the man   
Who reaches across her body and pulls the door shut.

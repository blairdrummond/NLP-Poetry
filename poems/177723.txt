title : Love at Thirty-two Degrees

                               I  

Today I dissected a squid, 
the late acacia tossing its pollen 
across the black of the lab bench. 
In a few months the maples   
will be bleeding. That was the thing:   
there was no blood 
only textures of gills creased like satin,   
suction cups as planets in rows. Be careful 
not to cut your finger, he says. But I’m thinking 
of fingertips on my lover’s neck   
last June. Amazing, hearts. 
This brachial heart. After class, 
I stole one from the formaldehyde 
& watched it bloom in my bathroom sink 
between cubes of ice.

Last night I threw my lab coat in the fire   
& drove all night through the Arizona desert   
with a thermos full of silver tequila. 

It was the last of what we bought   
on our way back from Guadalajara— 
desert wind in the mouth, your mother’s   
beat-up Honda, agaves   
twisting up from the soil 
like the limbs of cephalopods. 

Outside of Tucson, saguaros so lovely 
considering the cold, & the fact that you   
weren’t there to warm me. 
Suddenly drunk I was shouting that I wanted to see the stars   
as my ancestors used to see them— 

to see the godawful blue as Aurvandil’s frostbitten toe.

Then, there is the astronomer’s wife   
ascending stairs to her bed. 

The astronomer gazes out,   
one eye at a time, 

to a sky that expands   
even as it falls apart 

like a paper boat dissolving in bilge. 
Furious, fuming stars. 

When his migraine builds & 
lodges its dark anchor behind 

the eyes, he fastens the wooden buttons 
of his jacket, & walks 

outside with a flashlight 
to keep company with the barn owl   

who stares back at him with eyes 
that are no greater or less than 

a spiral galaxy. 
The snow outside 

is white & quiet 
as a woman’s slip 

against cracked floorboards. 
So he walks to the house 

inflamed by moonlight, & slips 
into the bed with his wife   

her hair & arms all 
in disarray 

like fish confused by waves.

Science— 

beyond pheromones, hormones, aesthetics of bone, 
every time I make love for love’s sake alone, 

I betray you.

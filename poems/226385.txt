title : The Virgin Considered as a Picture

author : Edgar Bowers

text : 
Her unawed face, whose pose so long assumed 
Is touched with what reality we feel,
Bends to itself and, to itself resumed,
Restores a tender fiction to the real.

And in her artful posture movement lies 
Whose timeless motion flesh must so conceal; 
Yet what her pose conceals we might surmise 
And might pretend to gather from her eyes

The final motion flesh gives up to art. 
But slowly, if we watch her long enough,
The nerves grow subtler, and she moves apart

Into a space too dim with time and blood 
For our set eyes to follow true enough,
Or nerves to guess about her, if they would.

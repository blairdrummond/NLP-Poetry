“To do as Adam did”

through the twilight’s fluoride glare Mercury in perihelion   
 
(rotating exactly three times   
 
while circling the sun twice)   
 
to Pluto foot tilt up the slide at either plane   
 
and build a Garden of the brain.   
 
 
 
Internetted eternities, interspersed   
 
with cypresses   
 
ply ringed air about the many spectacled apples there.   
 
Flamestitch niches orb in swivel orb, The Muses thrush at center   
 
turning. Phospheros arborescens they sing   
 
sense’s   
 
 
 
struck crystal clarities   
 
to knock the knees   
 
(or scarlet hollyhock, against a near blue sky).   
 
No end of fountains lost among the shrubberies full eye may bare.   
 
Fixed stars   
 
with fireflies jam the lilac.   
 
 
 
The Lord is a delicate hammerer.   
 
Gold hive upon gray matter   
 
He taps synapse (“carrying to”) (“carrying away”)   
 
an immense bronze pinecone moon-knit at the end of a vista   
 
of sunny jets d’eau, silver poplars. All   
 
shivered in a pool.   
 
 
 
Literally, a flowing: form-take-hand   
 
-with-form   
 
(That Which Fasteneth Us)   
 
pillar to pillar the great dance arch itself through all that   
 
is or was or will be, 3/4 time. This will be a glade   
 
at the head of one stream   
 
 
 
and a resonant gnomon before it will stretch regions of signaling   
 
gnat-like resiliencies in the atmosphere   
 
of where we are — 
 
or were.   
 
Or will be, when the mingled frame of mind   
 
of man is celebration.   
 
 
 
Gates, which separate the wings   
 
of tiered ilex, open
 
in caverns of atoms passing from one into another’s zenith   
 
of periodic movement, vast helicoidal shift:   
 
a vaulting of arteries
 
beating their heads against the dark.   
 
 
 
This is the body of light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vertically in a chromatic spread chord   
 
— Elysian elision — 
 
J’avais bâti, dans un rêve, un palais, un château ou des   
 
grottes 
 
along the lines of sight. 
 
Dear Garden:   
 
 
 
This is the way the world begins, the word begins.   
 
Through here,   
 
where grow the galax and aster together,   
 
I have planted Shadow illuminating The Field of Glittering   
 
Opposites:   
 
ange arc-en-ciel 
 
 
 
flocons de neige 
 
I have attempted a temple as if hierarchies of music   
 
beating against time gone adagio, that is the Secret Pool we return   
 
to. And not to stone   
 
but to the world behind its human   
 
mirror.   
 
 
 
This is the way the word begins, the world begins,   
 
wrestling the old ineffable to Bosch’s amazing white giraffe 
 
— or St. Rousseau   
 
intent a symmetry of whisker.   
 
Love itself is a kind of mirage nesting it all   
 
together. Around a center   
 
 
 
no one can see the end of at the Well of The Bottomless,   
 
I have placed parallels of bright guardians   
 
“along with the trill   
 
of the Nightingale,   
 
and the call of the European quail”   
 
as in The Pastoral.

P.S.
 
“I have refracted it with Prismes, and reflected with it Bodies which in Day-
light were of other colours; I have intercepted it with the coloured film of Air
interceding two compressed plates of glass; transmitted it through coloured
Mediums, and through Mediums irradiated with other sorts of Rays, and
diversly terminated it; and yet could never produce any new colour out of it.
But the most surprising, and wonderful composition was that 
 
                                              of Whiteness.”

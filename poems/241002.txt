        “Let’s be the same wound if we must bleed.         Let’s fight side by side, even if the enemy          is ourselves: I am yours, you are mine.”                        —Tommy Olofsson, Sweden
I’m not interested in
who suffered the most.
I’m interested in
people getting over it.

Once when my father was a boy 
a stone hit him on the head.
Hair would never grow there.
Our fingers found the tender spot
and its riddle: the boy who has fallen
stands up. A bucket of pears
in his mother’s doorway welcomes him home.
The pears are not crying.
Later his friend who threw the stone 
says he was aiming at a bird.
And my father starts growing wings.

Each carries a tender spot: 
something our lives forgot to give us.
A man builds a house and says,
“I am native now.”
A woman speaks to a tree in place 
of her son. And olives come.
A child’s poem says,
“I don’t like wars,
they end up with monuments.”
He’s painting a bird with wings
wide enough to cover two roofs at once.

Why are we so monumentally slow?
Soldiers stalk a pharmacy: 
big guns, little pills.
If you tilt your head just slightly
it’s ridiculous.

There’s a place in my brain
where hate won’t grow.
I touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.
Something pokes us as we sleep.

It’s late but everything comes next.

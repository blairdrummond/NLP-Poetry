title : Everybody Who is Dead

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
When a man knows another man 
Is looking for him 
He doesn’t hide. 

He doesn’t wait 
To spend another night 
With his wife 
Or put his children to sleep. 

He puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit 
And goes to the barber shop 
To let another man shave him. 

He shuts his eyes 
Remembers himself as a boy 
Lying naked on a rock by the water. 

Then he asks for the special lotion. 
The old men line up by the chair 
And the barber pours a little 
In each of their hands.

title : October

author : Jacob Polley

text : 
Although a tide turns in the trees 
       the moon doesn't turn the leaves, 
though chimneys smoke and blue concedes 
       to bluer home-time dark.

Though restless leaves submerge the park 
       in yellow shallows, ankle-deep, 
and through each tree the moon shows, halved
       or quartered or complete,

the moon's no fruit and has no seed, 
       and turns no tide of leaves on paths 
that still persist but do not lead 
       where they did before dark.

Although the moonstruck pond stares hard 
       the moon looks elsewhere. Manholes breathe. 
Each mind's a different, distant world 
       this same moon will not leave.

title : Dirty Face

author : Shel Silverstein

text : 
Where did you get such a dirty face,
 My darling dirty-faced child?
  
 I got it from crawling along in the dirt
 And biting two buttons off Jeremy’s shirt.
 I got it from chewing the roots of a rose
 And digging for clams in the yard with my nose.
 I got it from peeking into a dark cave
 And painting myself like a Navajo brave.
 I got it from playing with coal in the bin
 And signing my name in cement with my chin.
 I got if from rolling around on the rug
 And giving the horrible dog a big hug.
 I got it from finding a lost silver mine
 And eating sweet blackberries right off the vine.
 I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears
 And from having more fun than you’ve had in years.

in Riddles, for Mary

How many suns   
will cross its coign   
before the last   
freeze? What 
pennywhistle 
spun its point 
on the glass 
breeze? Whose   
airs are loosened   
in the pane 
like miniature   
degrees, where   
breath condenses   
into rain 
among the apple   
trees? Here 
tesserae 
have turned to earth, 
here blossoms may   
attend to birth   
as sun becoming   
leaves; here 
branches seem   
to lead the glass,   
whose scenes compose 
as seasons pass,   
the lifetime, piece 
by piece.... A sphere 

       * 

Begins and ends:   
suppose, as glaciers   
drop their catch,   
as memory’s 
a ragged seine,   
as grain by grain   
a dead morraine   
the sky is softly   
sifting ash, 
as constellations   
each rescind 
to embers, umbral   
lees—alas, 
the crown lens   
will surely tear   
to end the long,   
sweet refrain 
of sun to moon   
to sun again,   
of E from M 
C2— 
and then what breath   
once shaped the pane   
may lose itself   
(we pray) in airs   
our children, too,   
had breathed in time,   
and theirs, and theirs. 

       * 

If oracles 
recall in riddles   
orreries 
in orreries, 
the quantum of   
the apple’s arc 
the piper’s tune, 
the dancer’s turning   
crown of sonnets   
in the dark 
by starlight ground   
between the querns   
spun withershins   
of dawn and dusk   
to wreathe a green 
and weathered earth— 
it’s moonshine, love,   
and loneliness.   
Do looney jigs 
unwind the suns? 
Might jugglers drop them 
every one? 
Are seeds resewn,   
or tales respun?   
When pipers stop   
to play the bones   
the very stones   
are left undone. 

       * 

To please the Sphinx 
all life unreels 
through black magnetic   
stone-strewn fields   
where pitchblende blinks   
its slow decay   
tic-tic-tic 
de-lightedly 
by alpha, beta,   
gamma, delta— 
time dilates 
and starlight bends 
in gravity 
like roundelays.   
All light, partic- 
ulate, licks out   
one way, in waves;   
electric clouds   
expand in spheres   
whose uncracked shells   
concentrically   
unrecalled 
across the parsecs   
and the years   
ring out, shift red   
(like Hell), disperse 
the edges of 
the universe— 

       * 

Eclectic quarks   
a dish collects   
to parse into   
initial text— 
miraculous,   
exotic sky!— 
a Book of Kells   
whose quirkish tale 
in optical 
if stale effects   
is mirrored in   
the lemur’s eye, 
as through the hatchling’s   
candled egg 
comes first light to 
the cockerel— 
As Sol dissolves   
against the clock,   
and seismographic 
needles track,   
and continents   
incline to raft,   
uranium 
sines off to lead   
or raindrops pock 
a full carafe   
to lilypads 
inside the head— 

       * 

Assymmetries: 
no wave contracts— 
a tracer’s seam- 
less, sequinned O, 
or stoned window’s   
cataract— 
What echoes in   
the ears of bats,   
frail globes of light   
colliding back?   
Kaleidoscopes   
reshuffle shards,   
toc, starred; 
tic, intact— 
let’s retrodict   
the apple’s fall,   
the reel’s hiss,   
the needle’s spin;   
the pin-gears on   
the color wheel   
feel artificial 
after all; 
let’s kiss the dice   
behind the eyes   
and finish this   
where it begins— 
the empyrean’s   
synchesis: 

       * 

Now ask why seasons 
follow sequence, 
green to red   
or red to blue,   
while life re-seeds 
back through the snow 
like pattern bleeding 
into hue; 
how particles   
of colored sand 
sift back a shaman’s 
circling fist,   
as first riddled   
suns-at-seed 
spun out this creaking   
artifice— 
Would sonnets turned 
at light speed   
cooper square 
in their vitrines? 
Or meter’s super- 
sonics trace 
a breath against 
a mirrorscape 
where starlight’s slow 
as clotted cream, 
and every scheme   
anticipates? 

       * 

A stich in time: 
where earth has cooled,   
antique tectonic   
shelves awash 
in tepid seas 
whose milky chyme   
has knit such spiral   
molecules 
as struck off copies   
of themselves 
(O miracle!)— 
and what’s occurred   
but stray elec- 
trical discharge   
between some cloud   
and neaping tide   
still arcs inside   
the notochord....   
Who knows when first 
aortic arches 
registered 
an ocean’s surge,   
or slipped awake   
or stirred asleep;   
how many tides   
had ebbed until   
the tiny seahorse   
heart could leap? 

       * 

And here Odysseus’ 
dazzled seas, 
his charts, his quilled   
geodesy: 
where suns have fallen   
grain by grain— 
according to 
what codicil?— 
like yellow pollens, 
sill and pane;   
where Coriolis   
forces cause 
the cosmic dust 
to curl down drains 
whose gravities   
call back for us   
across the years,   
like sea to rain....   
Where, streaming tails 
of phosphorus   
dead-center through 
the Ferris whorls   
and net-work of   
the window’s seine, 
white moons like minnows   
slip its sash 
into the seiche   
inside the brain— 

       * 

A seer’s odd   
sensation: say 
why dawn should follow   
each saccade,   
Charybdis’ widened 
irides 
contract again   
from west to east, 
a narrow-waisted 
fall of sand 
or hollow winestem 
once released   
between two fingers 
of what hand, 
its syrinx sounding   
centuries.... 
And here the Masters 
of Lascaux 
pinched out an earth 
and shaped a sky   
inside a mountain 
years ago— 
time out of mind, 
we say—just so,   
rebounding echoes 
fade to rhyme   
across an inch,   
an age, and die— 

       * 

Of course he’s blind, 
whose achromatic 
lenses frame 
his myths around 
a perfect scale   
of azimuths 
and measured time— 
touch the braille: 
a moth wing brushed 
to prism’s flame, 
a telescope’s   
collapsing torch   
astronomers   
routinely scry, 
or pipers, jack-tars, 
all the same: 
to ask true numbers 
of the night, 
to know the cauter 
of the day— 
one star resolving, 
silver, high,   
another disk,   
another, then   
a cataract 
of viscous light,   
a stack of coins   
against the eye— 

       * 

And what attractive   
force is this? 
Coincidence, 
et cetera— 
full moons inset 
and stacked like plates; 
the planets nested   
flat as spoons— 
a satyr-play. 
Ah, love, instead,   
let’s study love;   
it’s getting late.   
As geomantic 
curvatures 
may cup the clanking 
cosmos in, 
a sparking censer’s   
pendulous 
and fragrant arc— 
as space depends 
on fob-chains which,   
if charmed and real   
are wholly im- 
material— 
then we, I think,   
are amateurs, 
and life a mys- 
tery to feel: 

       * 

If jugglers are   
geometers 
and pennywhistles 
cost a dime; 
if planets on   
their abacus   
click back to us,   
tic back, because   
the open skies   
in memory 
are perpendic- 
ular to time— 
one purple night’s 
a gemmary 
of all nights figured 
by design 
across our sleep   
in ores as rare 
as any dust-motes   
in the mine 
of empty space— 
an orrery 
whose imperfection 
in the mind 
of which jongleur   
you’ve married (who?)   
reflects in these   
beriddled lines: 

       * 

As ephemer- 
ides of blue 
and red and green   
are held apart   
caparisoning 
simple truth 
seen bending through   
the prism’s bars— 
as light unrav- 
elling reveals 
such orreries,   
ascending, starred,   
as unify 
into a field 
where dream dilates   
and glass extrudes   
and sonnets draw   
like taffy through   
a compass-needle’s   
eye—this chart   
is scanned in light   
of you, of you, 
the physics he’s   
accustomed to, 
the gravity 
against his heart,   
whose art again   
begins for you.

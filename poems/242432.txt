title : A Poem for Painters

author : John Wieners

text : 
Our age bereft of nobility
         How can our faces show it?
 I look for love.
         My lips stand out
 dry and cracked with want
                                      of it.
                                     Oh it is well.
 My poem shall show the need for it.
  
                         Again we go driven by forces
        we have no control over. Only
                                                     in the poem
       comes an image that we rule
                       the line by the pen
 in the painter’s hand one foot 
                               away from me.
  
                               Drawing the face
                               and its torture.
 That is why no one dares tackle it.
                     Held as they are in the hands
                                 of forces they
                     cannot understand.
                                                        That despair
         is on my face and shall show
         in the fine lines of any man.
  
 I had love once in the palm of my hand.
 See the lines there.
                                       How we played
 its game, are playing now
 in the bounds of white and heartless fields.
  
 Fall down on my head, love,
 drench my flesh in the streams 
                                 of fine sprays. Like
                                        French perfume
 so that I light up as
                                      mountain glorys
 and I am showered by the scent
                           of the finished line.
  
                                              No circles
                        but that two parallels do cross
 And carry our souls and bodies
        together as the planets,
                      Showing light on the surface
                             of our skin, knowing
                      that so much of it flows through
                            the veins underneath.
                      Our cheeks puffed with it.
                            The pockets full.
  
  
                                2.
  
 Pushed on by the incompletion
               of what goes before me
 I hesitate before this paper
               scratching for the right words.
  
 Paul Klee scratched for seven years
               on smoked glass, to develop
               his line, LaVigne says, look
 at his face! he who has spent 
              all night drawing mine.
  
        The sun also
 rises on the rooftops, beginning
 w/ violet. I begin in blue
 knowing why we are cool.
  
  
                                 3.
  
 My middle name is Joseph and I
 walk beside an ass on the way to what
 Bethlehem, where a new babe is born.
  
        Not the second hand of Yeats but 
        first prints on a cloudy windowpane.
  
 America, you boil over
  
  
                                  4.
  
        The cauldron scalds.
        Flesh is scarred. 
        Eyes shot.
  
        The street aswarm with 
        vipers and heavy armed bandits.
        There are bandages on the wounds
        but blood flows unabated. The bath-
        rooms are full. Oh stop up
                                                       the drains.
                               We are run over.
  
  
                                   5.
  
 Let me ramble here.
 yet stay within my own yardlines.
 I go out of bounds
             without defense,
 oh attack.
  
  
                                    6. 
  
    At last the game is over
                                              and the line lengthens.
    Let us stay with what we know.
  
 That love is my strength, that
 I am overpowered by it:
                                         desire
                                                   that too
 is on the face: gone stale.
 When green was the bed my love
 and I laid down upon.
 Such it is, heart’s complaint,
 You hear upon a day in June.
 And I see no end in view
 when summer goes, as it will,
 upon the roads, like singing
 companions across the land.
  
 Go with it man, if you must, 
 but leave us markers on your way.
  
 South of Mission, Seattle,
 over the Sierra Mountains,
 the Middle West and Michigan,
 moving east again, easy
 coming into Chicago and
 the cattle country, calling
 to each other over canyons,
 careful not to be caught
 at night, they are still out,
 the destroyers, and down
 into the South, familiar land,
 lush places, blue mountains
 of Carolina, into Black Mountain
 and you can sleep out, or
 straight across into States
  
 I cannot think of their names.
  
 This nation is so large, like
 our hands, our love it lives
 with no lover, looking only
 for the beloved, back home
 into the heart, New York,
 New England, Vermont green
 mountains, and Massachusetts
 my city, Boston and the sea.
 Again to smell what this calm
 ocean cannot tell us. The seasons.
 Only the heart remembers
 and records in words
 of works
 we lay down for those men
 who can come to them.
  
  
                                     7.
  
 At last. I come to the last defense.
  
 My poems contain no 
                      wilde beestes, no
 lady of the lake music
 of the spheres, or organ chants,
  
 yet by these lines
 I betray what little given me.
  
 One needs no defense.
  
              Only the score of a man’s
              struggle to stay  with
              what is his own, what
              lies within him to do.
  
              Without which is nothing,
              for him or those who hear him
              And I come to this,
              knowing the waste, leaving 
  
              the rest up to love
              and its twisted faces
              my hands claw out at
              only to draw back from the
              blood already running there.
  
              Oh come back, whatever heart
              you have left. It is my life
              you save. The poem is done.

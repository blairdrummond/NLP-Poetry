title : Planting a Dogwood

author : Roy Scheele

text : 
Tree, we take leave of you; you’re on your own. 
Put down your taproot with its probing hairs 
that sluice the darkness and create unseen 
the tree that mirrors you below the ground. 
For when we plant a tree, two trees take root: 
the one that lifts its leaves into the air, 
and the inverted one that cleaves the soil 
to find the runnel’s sweet, dull silver trace 
and spreads not up but down, each drop a leaf 
in the eternal blackness of that sky. 
The leaves you show uncurl like tiny fists 
and bear small button blossoms, greenish white, 
that quicken you. Now put your roots down deep; 
draw light from shadow, break in on earth’s sleep.

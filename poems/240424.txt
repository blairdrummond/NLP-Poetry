You haven’t heard
 from your father
 in six months
 and you can’t
 bring yourself
 to call. In Bengal, 
 farmers wore 
 masks on the backs
 of their heads
 to ward off tigers, 
 who, one supposes,
 wouldn’t attack
 a man who was 
 watching. If I don’t
 call, you thought,
 nothing is wrong.
 Each possibility is
 a cavern eaten
 out of limestone
 by water. Naming
 everything is a way
 of naming nothing.
 His family dropped
 away like cicada
 husks swept off
 tree trunks by rain.
 One brother, heart
 attack. His father’s
 two feet taken
 by diabetes, then
 his father by stroke.
 In a tornado, leave
 your windows ajar.
 A doorway for 
 an earthquake.
 In a lightning storm,
 do not pick up
 the phone. Learn
 to see out the back
 of your head. His 
 youngest brother, 
 weeks dead before
 discovery: the couch
 where he died,
 face down, shadow
 of rotted flesh
 stained into fabric,
 ghost of a face.
 Imagination kills
 the living just
 as easily as it brings
 back the dead.
 In Turkey, they hang
 the nazar—teardrop
 of blue glass—
 on lintels, above
 beds, from the rearview
 mirror. To ward
 off evil, they say.

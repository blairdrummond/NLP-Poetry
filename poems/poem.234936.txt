I started Early - Took my Dog - 
And visited the Sea - 
The Mermaids in the BasementBasement i.e., the bottom of the ocean 
Came out to look at me - 

And FrigatesFrigates fast and highly maneuverable warships of the 18th and 19th centuries, used to escort other larger ships, or to patrol the coast and blockade harbors - in the Upper Floor 
Extended Hempen HandsHempen Hands strong, thick ropes made of hemp, used on ships - 
Presuming Me to be a Mouse - 
Aground - oponopon upon the Sands - 

But no Man moved Me - till the Tide 
Went past my simple Shoe - 
And past my Apron - and my Belt 
And past my BoddiceBoddice bodice; an upper part of a woman's dress, or a rigid, laced corset worn underneath clothing, covering the upper part of a woman's body - too - 

And made as He would eat me up - 
As wholly as a Dew 
Opon a Dandelion's Sleeve - 
And then - I started - too - 

And He - He followed - close behind - 
I felt His Silver Heel 
Opon my Ancle - Then My Shoes 
Would overflow with Pearl - 

Until We met the Solid Town - 
No One He seemed to know - 
And bowing - with a Mighty look - 
At me - The Sea withdrew -

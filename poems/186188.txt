What could have been the big to-do 
that caused him to push me aside 
on that platform? Was a woman who knew 
there must be some good even inside 
an ass like him on board that train? 
Charity? Frances? His last chance 
in a ratty string of last chances? Jane? 
Surely in all of us is some good. 
Better love thy neighbor, buddy, 
lest she shove back. Maybe I should. 
It's probably just a cruddy 
downtown interview leading to 
some cheap-tie, careerist, dull 
cul-de-sac he's speeding to. 
Can he catch up with his soul? 
Really, what was the freaking crisis? 
Did he need to know before me 
if the lights searching the crowd's eyes 
were those of our train, or maybe 
the train of who he might have been, 
the person his own-heart-numbing, 
me-shoving anxiety about being 
prevents him from ever becoming? 
How has his thoughtlessness defiled 
who I was before he shoved me? 
How might I be smiling now if he'd smiled, 
hanging back, as though he might have loved me?

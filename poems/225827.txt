title : Horses on the Grass

author : Grace Schulman

text : 
From the tower window 
the moon 
draws a silver maple’s shadow 
across a spangled lawn; 
                                  horses 
rear, manes lashing the air, 
front legs floating. 
                              Half monarch, 
half shadow, the tree   
aspires to the sky; 
one branch, cracked by lightning, 
scrapes the earth.   
                           Reflected 
on the grass, bent twigs 
are curved hooves, galloping 
as the moon rises. 

Divided it stands 
in wholeness, mourning 
its victories, praising 
the god of trees, the king of horses. 

The tree holds souls 
in a bark prison 
poised like a runner at the starting line— 
and bolts free, wildly 
pawing the ground those roots lie under.

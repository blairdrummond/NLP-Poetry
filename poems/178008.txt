title : The Chocolate Infection

author : G. E. Murray

text : 
Days of the ferret, a sweet fever.   
Someone is walking through the sun   
With my tongue on a leash. 

Say “Ahhh.” Thank goodness, 
It’s not diabetes or the Bolivian Rot. 

This morning I am a cross   
Between lefthandedness   
And pointblank rage. 

The sun leaks like soft ice.   
The infection deepens . . . 

My eyes dissolve 
In a closet of heat. 
I become 4,000 
Yellow flowers, chirruping. 

O the cliché of a trek into the bowels of China. 
O the night that zings like a harpsichord factory! 
O gorgeous sun limping in the frozen dusk. 
O candy wrappers stacked like bricks! 

Snow growls on my roof.   
The infection deepens . . . 

A day on fire   
Placing real rabbits 
Where my mouth should be. 

I am several kinds of tigers.   
I am a confectionary treat. 

This fever fills my sleeves   
With pearls of honey drops.   
Am I too strange to bleed? 

I’m behind myself   
With a knife and fork,   
Revolving on a skewer. 

I am wild with grief 
As greasy children 
Reach deep into my fever   
To scoop out their revenge   
In double-dips . . . 

Come off it, kids. 
Next week, I’ll be raining   
On the iron road to Malta   
And perfect health, melting 
Like sugar in the mouth of the Orinoco.

Blank Verse

Once Phidias stood, with hammer in his hand, 
Carving Minerva from the breathing stone,   
Tracing with love the winding of a hair,   
A single hair upon her head, whereon   
A youth of Athens cried, "O Phidias,   
Why do you dally on a hidden hair?   
When she is lifted to the lofty front 
Of the Parthenon, no human eye will see." 
And Phidias thundered on him: "Silence, slave: 
Men will not see, but the Immortals will!"

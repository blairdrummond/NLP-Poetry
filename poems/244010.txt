					LoveIs an interruption or an aberration, a force in opposition to the ultimate inertia of the universe,   Wrote Marguerite Duras.   Whether or not it is worth it it occurs. Whether or not it is to be believed it is.   The wind moves us without a frond being needed to be held by a slave girl.   The rudiments of sentences are ancient without a mouth needing to remember  what it is losing as it lets those words out, something eviller than what they even mean right now, something too evil to be known right now   Or ever.   I feel sure that even the most culpable people have other qualities secreted  away   Adjusting their garments in light of fate   He turned his head upward, he looked up the white wall. The light from the lamp could be light coming from a great distance, it could be a great distance away, and the wall could be snow it is so beautiful, he said. His head looking up the wall, his eyes looking up it, he said, that nail in the wall could also be  beautiful, for so far away.

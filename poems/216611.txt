For S. S.
She reads by the light of a guttering candle 
and likes the feel of each page's gilt edge 
as she lifts it slightly at the corner, readying 

herself to turn it. If the wind whips 
the sycamore branches outside her window, 
if her nightgowned shoulders shudder once 

from a sudden chill, so much the better, 
and the book must tell of children toiling 
for bread and pennies in a textile mill, 

or tender brothers doomed to sharpen 
their bayonets in opposing armies, 
or a family of refugees, dust 

in their mouths, gazing with longing at the far 
shore of a river. And I long only 
to be the author of that book she reads 

whose page glows from the same dim 
flame that illuminates her face, 
the author whose thought she contemplates 

as she touches a fingertip to a word 
to mark her place and turns her head 
toward the kettle that has begun to whistle.

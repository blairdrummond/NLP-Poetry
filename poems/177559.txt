title : The Bogeyman

author : Jack Prelutsky

text : 
In the desolate depths of a perilous place 
the bogeyman lurks, with a snarl on his face. 
Never dare, never dare to approach his dark lair 
for he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you. 

He skulks in the shadows, relentless and wild 
in his search for a tender, delectable child. 
With his steely sharp claws and his slavering jaws 
oh he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you. 

Many have entered his dreary domain 
but not even one has been heard from again. 
They no doubt made a feast for the butchering beast 
and he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you. 

In that sulphurous, sunless and sinister place 
he'll crumple your bones in his bogey embrace. 
Never never go near if you hold your life dear, 
for oh! . . . what he'll do . . . when he gets you!

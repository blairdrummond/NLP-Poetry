title : Mild is the Parting Year

author : Walter Savage Landor

text : 
Mild is the parting year, and sweet
         The odour of the falling spray;
Life passes on more rudely fleet,
         And balmless is its closing day.

I wait its close, I court its gloom,
         But mourn that never must there fall
Or on my breast or on my tomb
         The tear that would have soothed it all.

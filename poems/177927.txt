text : 
That bummy smell you meet 
off the escalator at Civic Center, right before   
you turn onto McAllister, 
seems to dwell there, disembodied, 
on a shelf above the sidewalk. 

The mad old lady with lizard skin   
bent double 
                over her shopping cart   
and trailing a cloud of pigeons   
is nowhere in sight. 

A pile of rags here and there 
but no one underneath. 
                                 An invisible shrine   
commemorating what? 
Old mattresses and dusty flesh, 

piss and puked-on overcoats, what? 
                            Maybe death, 
now there’s a smell that likes to stick around.   
You used to find it in downtown Sally Anns   
and once 

in a hospital cafeteria, only faintly,   
after a bite of poundcake. 
                                       But here it lives, 
cheek by jowl with McDonald’s,   
still robust after a night of wind 

with its own dark little howdy-do 
for the drunks and cops, 
social workers and whores, 
or the elderly couple from Zurich   
leafing cooly through their guidebook.

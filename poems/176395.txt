title : Most Like an Arch This Marriage

author : John Ciardi

text : 
Most like an arch—an entrance which upholds   
and shores the stone-crush up the air like lace.   
Mass made idea, and idea held in place.   
A lock in time. Inside half-heaven unfolds. 

Most like an arch—two weaknesses that lean   
into a strength. Two fallings become firm.   
Two joined abeyances become a term   
naming the fact that teaches fact to mean. 

Not quite that? Not much less. World as it is,   
what’s strong and separate falters. All I do   
at piling stone on stone apart from you   
is roofless around nothing. Till we kiss 

I am no more than upright and unset.   
It is by falling in and in we make 
the all-bearing point, for one another’s sake,   
in faultless failing, raised by our own weight.

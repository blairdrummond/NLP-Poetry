title : Watching the Complex Train-Track Changes

To Men
You put on an ornate ballgown 
You say “someone has to do it” 
You take me to where you work, 
The inside of a pyramid with chasms, 
Watching the complex train-track changes 
Products and objects make love to my father 
Two babies are born—Bruno and Daisy 
You take your shirt off looking boylike & lovely 
You get on the plane, both clown & wizard 
And then get off in a comedy of manners 
Our dates become a comedy of dinners 
Your name rhymes with clothes 
Your plane folds & flies away 
Without us, I’ll make the next one 
We are enclosed in spaceless epics by breathless bricks 
& still we’ll meet like runes or the leashes for hawks 
Let’s go! Can we stay? Go to sleep. 
A tree wouldn’t talk or weep if I-forget-what 
And you in the train’s opulent rooms 
Switch your cock to a baby and then say 
“Must there (not) be a law against this?” 
You add, “I have been thinking of you in my head” 
You wear green glitter on your shirt instead of 
A tie, that’s how I recognize you as you 
You are the prep cook the sous-chef you make 
Duplicating potato salad like the loaves & fishes 
You create gorgeous paper-like sculptures of foods 
We go down in the car through threatening snows 
To arrive in a second to eat in a renovated place 
You and I tell “what” we are at the end of a movie 
Our podium of soft loud feet flies by accident 
I take the train to your house to hear Shakespeare & Verdi 
Everyone applauds when you walk in. The director 
Holds up each actor & describes his physical being 
I talk to your father but only by telephone 
You have the royal blue 8 � x 11 notebook with the lock on it 
I want one but you say you cant get them anymore 
I walk twice through that city I’ve been in before 
All through its rooms, its streets and its Commons

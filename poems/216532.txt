title : Requiem Shark

author : Rad Smith

text : 
This morning as I gulp five gleaming white 
capsules of shark cartilage 
to make me strong again, I want 
another look at the terrible 
eye with its nictitating membrane, 
those extravagant fins, 
the ampullae of Lorenzini freckling its snout, 
all of that huge body on the rippled sand 
in turtle grass 
with an entourage of neon-blue barjacks, 
and a remora wriggling in 
and out of its gill-slits. 
I even want to touch it again, 
and this time not just with my fingertips, 
but my palm, loveline and lifeline, 
my wrist, the underside of my forearm. 
I want to press my cheek against its chaste 
astonishing skin smooth as a headstone, 
want the touch that feels like a blow, 
the summoning touch, the touch 
of reckoning, the consummating touch, as well as 
the stinging sandblown touch of regret, 
the stranger's touch on the train, 
the reproachful touch, 
even the last touch of a human 
who has lain down with a shark, 
the touch I have spent my life so ignorant of, 
your touch as you unbutton my shirt, 
the searing, unbearable touch.

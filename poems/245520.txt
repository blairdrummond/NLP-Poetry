title : What I Learned From the Incredible Hulk

When it comes to clothes, make
 an allowance for the unexpected.
 Be sure the spare in the trunk
 of your station wagon with wood paneling
  
 isn’t in need of repair. A simple jean jacket
 says Hey, if you aren’t trying to smuggle
 rare Incan coins through this peaceful
 little town and kidnap the local orphan,
  
 I can be one heck of a mellow kinda guy.
 But no matter how angry a man gets, a smile
 and a soft stroke on his bicep can work
 wonders. I learned that male chests
  
 also have nipples, warm and established—
 green doesn’t always mean envy.
 It’s the meadows full of clover
 and chicory the Hulk seeks for rest, a return
  
 to normal. And sometimes, a woman
 gets to go with him, her tiny hands
 correcting his rumpled hair, the cuts
 in his hand. Green is the space between
  
 water and sun, cover for a quiet man,
 each rib shuttling drops of liquid light.

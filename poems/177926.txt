title : Disappointment

author : August Kleinzahler

text : 
A faint smell of urine 
embroidering that bouquet of mold the big cushions   
give off days the fog won’t lift, 

and a shelf of bone 
growing out over the eyelids like evening’s shadow   
across a field of corn— 

The whole parade 
leaking out from your shoulders, bequeathing   
to the groin a pang of distance; 

then that metallic taste in the mouth   
and a voice you had let yourself believe   
was dead 

close now by your ear, intimate and sweet: 

                                  Well, well, well,   
look what we have here.

title : The Only Portrait of Emily Dickinson

author : Irene McKinney

text : 
The straight neck held up out of the lace
 is bound with a black velvet band.
 She holds her mouth the way she chooses,
 the full underlip constrained by a small muscle.

 She doesn’t blink or look aside,
 although her left eye is considering
 a slant. She would smile
 if she had time, but right now

 there is composure to be invented.
 She stares at the photographer.
 The black crepe settles. Emerging
 from the sleeve, a shapely hand

 holds out a white, translucent blossom.
 “They always say things which embarrass
 my dog,” she tells the photographer.
She is amused, but not as much as he’d like.

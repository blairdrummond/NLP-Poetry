Ballad

My reading is extremely deep and wide;   
And as our modern education goes-- 
Unique I think, and skilfully applied   
To Art and Industry and Autres Choses 
Through many years of scholarly repose.   
But there is one thing where I disappoint   
My numerous admirers (and my foes).   
Painting on Vellum is my weakest point.

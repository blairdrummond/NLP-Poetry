Sonnet

A woof reversed the fatal shuttles weave, 
How slow! but never once they slip the thread. 
Hither, upon the Georgian idler's tread, 
Up spacious ways the lindens interleave, 
Clouding the royal air since yester-eve, 
Come men bereft of time and scant of bread, 
Loud, who were dumb, immortal, who were dead, 
Thro' the cowed world their kingdom to retrieve. 

What ails thee, England? Altar, mart, and grange 
Dream of the knife by night; not so, not so 
The clear Republic waits the general throe, 
Along her noonday mountains' open range. 
God be with both! for one is young to know 
The other's rote of evil and of change.

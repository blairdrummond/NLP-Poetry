title : Fourth of July at Santa Ynez

         I 
Under the makeshift arbor of leaves 
a hot wind blowing smoke and laughter. 
Music out of the renegade west, 
too harsh and loud, many dark faces 
moved among the sweating whites. 

         II 
Wandering apart from the others, 
I found an old Indian seated alone 
on a bench in the flickering shade. 

He was holding a dented bucket; 
three crayfish, lifting themselves 
from the muddy water, stirred 
and scraped against the greasy metal. 

         III 
The old man stared from his wrinkled 
darkness across the celebration, 
unblinking, as one might see 
in the hooded sleep of turtles. 

A smile out of the ages of gold 
and carbon flashed upon his face 
and vanished, called away 
by the sound and the glare around him, 
by the lost voice of a child 
piercing that thronged solitude. 

         IV 
The afternoon gathered distance 
and depth, divided in the shadows 
that broke and moved upon us . . .

Slowly, too slowly, as if returned 
from a long and difficult journey, 
the old man lifted his bucket 
and walked away into the sunlit crowd.

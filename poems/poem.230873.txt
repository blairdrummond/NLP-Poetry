What the Sexton Said 
Vachel Lindsay 
1879-1931


Living, Time & Brevity, Sorrow & Grieving, Death

Rhymed Stanza, Common Measure, Elegy

Your dust will be upon the wind 
Within some certain years, 
Though you be sealed in lead to-day 
Amid the country's tears. 

When this idyllic churchyard 
Becomes the heart of town, 
The place to build garage or inn, 
They'll throw your tombstone down. 

Your name so dim, so long outworn, 
Your bones so near to earth, 
Your sturdy kindred dead and gone, 
How should men know your worth? 

So read upon the runic moon 
Man's epitaph, deep-writ. 
It says the world is one great grave. 
For names it cares no whit. 

It tells the folk to live in peace, 
And still, in peace, to die. 
At least, so speaks the moon to me, 
The tombstone of the sky.

title : Field Effect

For 8 months he lay in bed over the
  
 difference between “the bell rings” & “he rings
  
 the bell.” Did those 2 “rings” SOUND
  
 DIFFERENT? The invisible disturbance which
  
 is the bell’s vibration beating at the air—a
  
 FIELD EFFECT—does it shift with the
  
 ringer’s will? This, he thought, was the 
  
 smallest difference between things which the
  
 human mind could hold (or almost hold, the
  
 thought-of-it falling away from the thinking,
  
 a penny rolling to the horizon & so to
  
 sleep . . .). He couldn’t get up. It became clear
  
 that he was the murderer. Everyone knows. A
  
 man standing at a podium reads from notes.
  
 In the audience people nod in immaculate
  
 suits, women & men. When I am done
  
 someone will transcribe what I say into speech.
  
 It will not resemble my notes. He is just THE
  
 THING between his notes & his speech. This is
  
 only fair, that he be the air. Some of the
  
 women wear hats with feathers in them, wild,
  
 candescent. In the audience is a boy named B,
  
 not the letter, not the note. Another sound,
  
 neither letter nor note—

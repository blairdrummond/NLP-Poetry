title : Mighty Forms

The earth had wanted us all to itself. 
The mountains wanted us back for themselves. 
The numbered valleys of serpentine wanted us; 
that’s why it happened as it did, the split 
as if one slow gear turned beneath us. . . 
Then the Tuesday shoppers paused in the street 
and the tube that held the trout-colored train 
and the cords of action from triangular buildings 
and the terraced gardens that held camelias 
shook and shook, each flower a single thought. 

Mothers and children took cover under tables. 
I called out to her who was my life. 
From under the table—I hid under the table 
that held the begonia with the fiery stem, 
the stem that had been trying to root, that paused 
in its effort—I called to the child who was my life. 
And understood, in the endless instant 
before she answered, how Pharaoh’s army, seeing 
the ground break open, seeing the first fringed 
horses fall into the gap, made their vows, 
that each heart changes, faced with a single awe 
and in that moment a promise is written out. 

However we remember California later 
the earth we loved will know the truth: 
that it wanted us back for itself 
with our mighty forms and our specific longings, 
wanted them to be air and fire but they wouldn’t; 
the kestrel circled over a pine, which lasted, 
the towhee who loved freedom, gathering seed 
during the shaking lasted, the painting released 
by the wall, the mark and hook we placed 
on the wall, and the nail, and the memory 
of driving the nail in, these also lasted—

title : The History of Mothers of Sons

author : Lisa Furmanski

text : 
All sons sleep next to mothers, then alone, then with others 
Eventually, all our sons bare molars, incisors 
Meanwhile, mothers are wingless things in a room of stairs 
A gymnasium of bars and ropes, small arms hauling self over self 

Mothers hum nonsense, driving here 
and there (Here! There!) in hollow steeds, mothers reflecting 
how faint reflections shiver over the road 
All the deafening musts along the way 

Mothers favor the moon—hook-hung and mirroring the sun— 
there, in a berry bramble, calm as a stone 

This is enough to wrench our hand out of his 
and simply devour him, though he exceeds even the tallest grass 

Every mother recalls a lullaby, and the elegy blowing through it

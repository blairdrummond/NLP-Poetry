title : Wedding Dress

author : Michael Waters

text : 
That Halloween I wore your wedding dress, 
our children spooked & wouldn’t speak for days. 
I’d razored taut calves smooth, teased each blown tress, 
then—lipsticked, mascaraed, & self-amazed— 
shimmied like a starlet on the dance floor. 
I’d never felt so sensual before— 
Catholic schoolgirl & neighborhood whore. 
In bed, dolled up, undone, we fantasized: 
we clutched & fused, torn twins who’d been denied. 
You were my shy groom. Love, I was your bride.

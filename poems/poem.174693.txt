               BODY 

       Farewell! I go to sleep; but when
       The day-star springs, I'll wake again.

               SOUL 

       Go, sleep in peace; and when thou liest
Unnumber'd in thy dust, when all this frame
Is but one dram, and what thou now descriest
       In sev'ral parts shall want a name,
Then may his peace be with thee, and each dust
Writ in his book, who ne'er betray'd man's trust!

               BODY 

       Amen! but hark, ere we two stray
       How many hours dost think 'till day?

               SOUL 

       Ah go; th'art weak, and sleepy. Heav'n
Is a plain watch, and without figures winds
All ages up; who drew this circle, even
       He fills it; days and hours are blinds.
Yet this take with thee. The last gasp of time
Is thy first breath, and man's eternal prime.

					The man slapped her bottom   like a man did in a video,  then he waited   as if for shadow to completely cover the sun.  Moments later   archeologists found him.  *  The idea that they were reenacting something which had been staged in the first place bothered her. If she wanted to go on, she’d need to ignore this limp chronology. She assumed he was conscious of the same constraint. But she almost always did want to proceed. Procedure! If only either one of them believed in the spontaneity of the original actors and could identify with one. Be one. For this to work, she reasoned, one of us would have to be gone.  * “Well, look who missed   the fleeting moment,”  Green Giant gloats   over dazed children.  If to transpose   is to know,  we can cover our losses.  But only   If talking,  Formerly food,  Now meant   Not now  So recovery   Ran rings.  If to traverse   is to envelop,  I am held and sung to sleep.

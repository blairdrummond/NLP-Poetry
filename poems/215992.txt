title : Madmen

author : Billy Collins

text : 
They say you can jinx a poem 
if you talk about it before it is done. 
If you let it out too early, they warn, 
your poem will fly away, 
and this time they are absolutely right. 

Take the night I mentioned to you 
I wanted to write about the madmen, 
as the newspapers so blithely call them, 
who attack art, not in reviews, 
but with breadknives and hammers 
in the quiet museums of Prague and Amsterdam. 

   Actually, they are the real artists, 
you said, spinning the ice in your glass. 
The screwdriver is their brush. 
The real vandals are the restorers, 
you went on, slowly turning me upside-down, 
the ones in the white doctor's smocks 
who close the wound in the landscape, 
and thus ruin the true art of the mad. 

I watched my poem fly down to the front 
of the bar and hover there 
until the next customer walked in— 
then I watched it fly out the open door into the night 
and sail away, I could only imagine, 
over the dark tenements of the city. 

All I had wished to say 
was that art was also short, 
as a razor can teach with a slash or two, 
that it only seems long compared to life, 
but that night, I drove home alone 
with nothing swinging in the cage of my heart 
except the faint hope that I might 
catch a glimpse of the thing 
in the fan of my headlights, 
maybe perched on a road sign or a street lamp, 
poor unwritten bird, its wings folded, 
staring down at me with tiny illuminated eyes.

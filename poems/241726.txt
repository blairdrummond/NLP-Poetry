title : The Mystery of the Hunt

author : Michael McClure

text : 
It’s the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me,
                    That drives us like lemmings, but cautiously—
 The search for a bright square cloud—the scent of lemon verbena—
                     Or to learn rules for the game the sea otters
                                       Play in the surf.
  
                   It is these small things—and the secret behind them
                                     That fill the heart.
                         The pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon
                                 That link them together
                       And pull their freedom into our senses, 
  
              The smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals
  
          —The rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled.
                                  It is these small things
  
                    That when brought into vision become an inferno.

title : Flies on Shit

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
To the gentlemen from the south   
to the tourists from the north 
who write poems about the south   
to the dumb-ass students 
I’d like to ask one lousy question 
have you ever seen a regatta of flies 
sail around a pile of shit 
and then come back and picnic on the shit 
just once in your life have you heard 
flies on shit 
because I cut my eye teeth on flies 
floating in shit

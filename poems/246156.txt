title : Problems of Knowledge

author : Joshua Edwards

text : 
Translation broadens language
as divorce and remarriage extend family.

Born to fade and break, facts 
huddle inside black brackets.

Work means inquisition as a child 
separates a cricketâ€™s wings from thorax.

Ideas come apart as monads, metastasizing 
rhapsody on the edge of delicate dusk.

Thunder sounds in the distance or television, 
always on in this constant rain.

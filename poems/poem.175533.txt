Refrain, Rhymed Stanza, Assonance

    The poet pursues his beautiful theme;
The preacher his golden beatitude;
    And I run after a vanishing dream--
    The glittering, will-o'-the-wispish gleam
Of the properly scholarly attitude--
The highly desirable, the very advisable,
The hardly acquirable, properly scholarly attitude.

    I envy the savage without any clothes,
Who lives in a tropical latitude;
    It's little of general culture he knows.
    But then he escapes the worrisome woes
Of the properly scholarly attitude--
The unceasingly sighed over, wept over, cried over,
The futilely died over, properly scholarly attitude.

    I work and I work till I nearly am dead,
And could say what the watchman said--that I could!
    But still, with a sigh and a shake of the head,
    "You don't understand," it is ruthlessly said,
"The properly scholarly attitude--
The aye to be sought for, wrought for and fought for,
The ne'er to be caught for, properly scholarly attitude--"

    I really am sometimes tempted to say
That it's merely a glittering platitude;
    That people have just fallen into the way,
    When lacking a subject, to tell of the sway
Of the properly scholarly attitude--
The easily preachable, spread-eagle speechable,
In practice unreachable, properly scholarly attitude.

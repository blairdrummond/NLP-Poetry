title : The Café Filtre

author : Paul Blackburn

text : 
Slowly and with persistence
 he eats away at the big steak,
 gobbles up the asparagus, its
 butter & salt & root taste,
 drinks at a glass of red wine, and carefully
                              taking his time, mops up
                the gravy with bread—
 The top of the café filtre is
 copper, passively shines back, & between
 mouthfuls of steak, sips of wine,
                              he remembers
                at intervals to
 with the flat of his hand
 the top removed,
                                        bang
 at the apparatus,
 create the suction that
 the water will
                           fall through
                           more quickly
  
 Across the tiles of the floor, the
 cat comes to the table  :  again.
 “I’ve already given you one piece of steak,
 what do you want from me now? Love?”
                             He strokes her head, her
 rounded black pregnant head, her greedy
      front paws slip from his knee,
      the pearl of great price
      ignored  .  She’s bored, he
 bangs the filtre again, its top is copper
 passively shines back  .
                                                                   Food & wine nearly
 finished.
 He lifts the whole apparatus off the cup  .  Merciful
 God, will it never be done?                      Too cold
                                                                       already
 to add cream and sugar, he offers the last
 piece of steak with his fingers  .
                           She accepts it with calm
                                       dignity,
 even delicacy  .  The coffee goes down at a gulp, it
 is black
 & lukewarm  .

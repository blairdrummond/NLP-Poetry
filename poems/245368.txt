title : Flour and Ash

author : Chana Bloch

text : 
“Make flour into dough,” she answers,
 “and fire will turn it into food.
 Ash is the final abstraction of matter.
 You can just brush it away.”
  
 She tacks a sheet of paper to the wall,
 dips her hand in a palette of flour and ash,
 applies the fine soft powders with a fingertip,
 highlighting in chalk and graphite,
 blending, blurring with her thumb.
 Today she is working in seven shades of gray.
  
 Outside the door, day lilies 
 in the high flush of summer-
 about-to-be-fall. Her garden burns
 red and yellow in the dry August air
 and is not consumed.
  
 Inside, on the studio wall, a heavy 
 particulate smoke
 thickens and rises. Footsteps grime the snow.
 The about-to-be-dead line up on the ramp
 with their boxy suitcases,
 ashen shoes.
  
 When I get too close she yanks me back. 
 She hovers over her creation
 though she too has a mind
 to brush against that world
 and wipe it out.

‘He thought it had only been put there to finish off th’ alphabet, like, though ampus-and (&) would ha’ done as well.’  (George Eliot: Adam Bede) 
And had in fact, for generations— 
the plump, open armed ‘&’ waving goodbye 
from the end of the old-world alphabet 
like an innkeeper framed in doorway candlelight, 
farewells swelled with hopes of come again. 

Then the old world burned down 
because we sensed, beyond the candle’s glow, 
the road led to a dead end. No 
traveler returned, even the unverified 
odd reports of happy returns petered out. 

So we renovated the alphabet, signing it 
off with a streamlined ‘z’ as sharp 
and final as lightning: no sense 
in posting notice of further connections 
that didn’t exist, or passing off maps as places. 

Trouble was, nobody felt at home 
in the revamped compound. Bookings fell off, 
postcards of views of blank walls piled unsold 
in the unvisited gift shop, the same 
paperbacks stalled on the revolving racks. 

It was a paradise of sorts, a golden age 
of nullity, no relatives 
breaking the costly silence. No wonder Eliot’s 
befuddled Jacob Storey felt his page 
of Z’s was somehow ‘not right,’ that 

‘it was a letter you never wanted hardly.’ 
He knew, as one newly released from the unlit 
cell of his long-unlettered ignorance, 
what you did want hardly: you wanted, 
needed—as hardly as Hetty Sorrel, 

abandoned at the dock—someone to stand by. 
You were the murderess of your baby, 
silenced with a ‘z.’ You needed a hand, 
the open-armed return of all your relations. 
You wanted, harder than death, ampersand

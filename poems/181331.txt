The sniper at work over the street corner acts. 
Two girls, breathless after the dash across, 
radiate heat and bouquets, as when ironing 
silken delicates. With one, in place of a chignon, 
goosefleshed Christmas wheat. She explodes, rages,   
curses the sniper; at the window, seemingly, 
I'm watching a beautiful storm. From the other, words 
like a sun-umbrella's flutterings, in the morning, 
on an Adriatic beach. Now and again, she flicks her head 
back: just for us. As she well knows: flicked hair 
sweetens the air. Beauty, always forthcoming, never   
misses a half-smile. As they well know: making us happy 
costs them nothing. Those half-smiles saying 
you aren't just one fact among others—not at all, 
not for them—even banishing the hex of that fact 
if any other woman's glacial look had magicked it up. 
The air smelt strongly of my distant youth 
when every boulevard led to the end of the world,   
when life was not yet "threadbare as a proverb." 
Now they're going, leaving such tenderness in me 
as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens   
into which snowflakes are swarming. 
So they disappeared chattering, not girls 
but breezes, blown lightly, surprisingly,   
through the St. John's heat of siege. The St. John's heat   
of being.

title : [Begins in interruption...]

text : 
Begins in interruption:
an ambulance bell at the center

of sleep, the room tilts 
sideways, furniture slides,

an octet of amber blue
verres à liqueur, one with a cut

at the lip, clatters as a quaalude 
light in tatters mattes the

curtains ormolu:
                              I miss you

is what I want to say 
like a rocket

stocked from the Reagan 
years, its radar gone haywire,

wiring fried but
live inside a bunker of some

private Soviet 
Union you & I —

Sonnet

I saw the spot where our first parents dwelt;   
And yet it wore to me no face of change,   
For while amid its fields and groves, I felt   
As if I had not sinned, nor thought it strange;   
My eye seemed but a part of every sight,   
My ear heard music in each sound that rose; 
Each sense forever found a new delight,   
Such as the spirit's vision only knows;   
Each act some new and ever-varying joy   
Did my Father's love for me prepare;   
To dress the spot my ever fresh employ,   
And in the glorious whole with Him to share;   
No more without the flaming gate to stray,   
No more for sin's dark stain the debt of death to pay.

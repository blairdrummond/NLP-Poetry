title : Willowspout

author : R. T. Smith

text : 
Because someone thirsty enough 
to trust Old Testament wisdom 
followed the deepening greens 

and found a spring, silver 
in the shadow of blue ridges, 
I can kneel beneath 

this spill of willow 
limbs a century later 
and drink water 

risen from roots 
to enter the evening 
through a spout, the way 

Cherokee stories say the first 
people were born, 
washing into the world 

of such trees whose bark, 
like the water I cup 
to my parched mouth, 

tastes leafy and sweet 
and has the power, 
the old ones say, to heal.

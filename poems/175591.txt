title : What I Saw

author : Robert Duncan

text : 
The white peacock roosting   
might have been Christ, 

         featherd robe of Osiris, 


the radiant bird, a sword-flash, 

         percht in the tree 


and the other,    the fumed-glass slide 

       —were like night and day, 


the slit of an eye opening in 

         time 

vertical to the horizon

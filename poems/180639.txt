title : Love's Growth

author : John Donne

text : 
I scarce believe my love to be so pure 
   As I had thought it was, 
   Because it doth endure 
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass; 
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore 
My love was infinite, if spring make’ it more. 

But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow 
With more, not only be no quintessence, 
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense, 
And of the sun his working vigor borrow, 
Love’s not so pure, and abstract, as they use 
To say, which have no mistress but their muse, 
But as all else, being elemented too, 
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do. 

And yet no greater, but more eminent, 
   Love by the spring is grown; 
   As, in the firmament, 
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown, 
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough, 
From love’s awakened root do bud out now. 

If, as water stirred more circles be 
Produced by one, love such additions take, 
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make, 
For they are all concentric unto thee; 
And though each spring do add to love new heat, 
As princes do in time of action get 
New taxes, and remit them not in peace, 
No winter shall abate the spring’s increase.

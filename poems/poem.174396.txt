Rhymed Stanza

The cold earth slept below; 
         Above the cold sky shone; 
                And all around, 
                With a chilling sound, 
From caves of ice and fields of snow 
The breath of night like death did flow 
                Beneath the sinking moon. 

The wintry hedge was black; 
         The green grass was not seen; 
                The birds did rest 
                On the bare thorn's breast, 
Whose roots, beside the pathway track, 
Had bound their folds o'er many a crack 
                Which the frost had made between. 

Thine eyes glow'd in the glare 
         Of the moon's dying light; 
                As a fen-fire's beam 
                On a sluggish stream 
Gleams dimly--so the moon shone there, 
And it yellow'd the strings of thy tangled hair, 
                That shook in the wind of night. 

The moon made thy lips pale, beloved; 
         The wind made thy bosom chill; 
                The night did shed 
                On thy dear head 
Its frozen dew, and thou didst lie 
Where the bitter breath of the naked sky 
                Might visit thee at will.

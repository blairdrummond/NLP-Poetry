title : Blackberrying

author : Sylvia Plath

text : 
Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,   
Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly, 
A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea 
Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries 
Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes 
Ebon in the hedges, fat 
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers. 
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me. 
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides. 

Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks— 
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky. 
Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting. 
I do not think the sea will appear at all. 
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within. 
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies, 
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen. 
The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.   
One more hook, and the berries and bushes end. 

The only thing to come now is the sea. 
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,   
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face. 
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt. 
I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me   
To the hills’ northern face, and the face is orange rock   
That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space   
Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths   
Beating and beating at an intractable metal.

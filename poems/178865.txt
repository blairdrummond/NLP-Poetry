title : No Children, No Pets

I bring the cat’s body home from the vet’s 
in a running-shoe box held shut 
with elastic bands. Then I clean 
the corners where she has eaten and 
slept, scrubbing the hard bits of food 
from the baseboard, dumping the litter 
and blasting the pan with a hose. The plastic 
dishes I hide in the basement, the pee- 
soaked towel I put in the trash. I put 
the catnip mouse in the box and I put 
the box away, too, in a deep 
dirt drawer in the earth. 

When the death-energy leaves me, 
I go to the room where my daughter slept 
in nursery school, grammar school, high school, 
I lie on her milky bedspread and think 
of the day I left her at college, how nothing 
could keep me from gouging the melted candle-wax 
out from between her floorboards, 
or taking a razor blade to the decal 
that said to the firemen, “Break 
this window first.” I close my eyes now 
and enter a place that’s clearly 
expecting me, swaddled in loss 
and then losing that, too, as I move 
from room to bone-white room 
in the house of the rest of my life.

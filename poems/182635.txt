title : La Petite Vie

author : Allen Edwin Butt

text : 
Love is the kindest 
expression 
of absence— 

Or else 
is a day 
by the river, 

in which by 
motion 
it becomes clear— 

there have been 
in an hour an 
infinite train 

of rivers, & which 
did you want 
to see? One 

comes slowly 
to realize 
there is no evading things 

(the heart will have 
its way, though 
its will go 

unfulfilled), 
& there is no shame 
in this. 

The pleasures in this world— 
soft breeze, soft 
thighs, a bit of music, 

words that make 
a good sound— 
suggest when taken 

whole that the 
thing 
the body longs for 

is not & never has been 
some petite mort, 
a true thing 

known to grass 
& the elderly man 
with a kind word 

in greeting. And 
the woman saying 
that she is about 

to come, as in 
going to arrive— 
at last to fill 

the body held so long 
by stewards 
in her name.

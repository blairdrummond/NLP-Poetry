title : Draft of a Dream

author : Steven Cramer

text : 
The message I found on the Post-it note 
went thus: love truth; expect to be found out. 
Kid-style capitals proved I wrote it, but 
left no clue why I'd swelled into a fat 

clause no editor could edit; then, an entry 
on a shrink's list of patient slang for sex— 
her desk Norwegian teak, the mug of tea 
on which she had affixed her Post-it notes 

hot against her knuckle, their lips of stickum 
loosening . . . And yet, I knew the note 
to peel away at hour's end would terminate 
our sessions—cool as the draft her linen 

skirt was lifting to: Love, just stay benighted,  
given everything I know you've got to hide.

title : Wonderbread

Loaf after loaf, in several sizes, 
and never does it not look fresh, 
as though its insides weren’t moist
or warm crust not the kind that spices 
a room with the plump aroma of toast.

Found on the table; among shadows 
next to the kitchen phone; dispatched 
FedEx (without return address, though). 
Someone, possibly more than one 
person, loves me. Well then, who?

Amazing that bread should be so weightless, 
down-light when handled, as a me
dying to taste it takes a slice.
Which lasts just long enough to reach 
my mouth, but then, at the first bite,

Nothing! Nothing but air, thin air ....   
Oh. One more loaf of wonderbread, 
only a pun for bread, seductive 
visually, but you could starve. 
Get rid of it, throw it in the river

Beyond which, grain fields. Future food for the just 
and the unjust, those who love, and do not love.

The last light of a July evening drained 
into the streets below: My love and I had hard   
things to say and hear, and we sat over   
wine, faltering, picking our words carefully. 

The afternoon before I had lain across   
my bed and my cat leapt up to lie   
alongside me, purring and slowly   
growing dozy. By this ritual I could 

clear some clutter from my baroque brain. 
And into that brief vacancy the image 
of a horse cantered, coming straight to me,   
and I knew it brought hard talk and hurt 

and fear. How did we do? A medium job,   
which is well above average. But because   
she had opened her heart to me as far   
as she did, I saw her fierce privacy, 

like a gnarled, luxuriant tree all hung   
with disappointments, and I knew   
that to love her I must love the tree   
and the nothing it cares for me.

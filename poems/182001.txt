title : Ode to a Yellow Onion

author : C. Dale Young

text : 
And what if I had simply passed you by, 
your false skins gathering light in a basket,   
those skins of unpolished copper, 
would you have lived more greatly? 

Now you are free of that metallic coating, 
a broken hull of parchment, 
the dried petals of a lily— 
those who have not loved you 
will not know differently. 

But you are green fading into yellow— 
how deceptive you have been. 

Once I played the cithara, 
fingers chafing against each note. 
Once I worked the loom, 
cast the shuttle through the warp. 
Once I scrubbed the tiles 
deep in the tub of Alejandro. 
Now I try to deciper you. 

Beyond the village, within a cloud 
of wild cacao and tamarind, 
they chant your tale, how you, 
most common of your kind, 
make the great warrior-men cry 
but a woman can unravel you.

Little Boy Blue, 
please cover your nose. 
You sneezed on Miss Muffet 
and ruined her clothes. 
You sprayed Mother Hubbard, 
and now she is sick. 
You put out the fire   
on Jack’s candlestick. 
Your sneeze is the reason   
why Humpty fell down. 
You drenched Yankee Doodle 
when he came to town. 
The blind mice are angry! 
The sheep are upset! 
From now on use tissues 
so no one gets wet!

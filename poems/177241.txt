text : 
What are we bound for? What’s the yield 
   Of all this energy and waste?
Why do we spend ourselves and build 
       With such an empty haste?

Wherefore the bravery we boast?
   How can we spend one laughing breath 
When at the end all things are lost
       In ignorance and death? . . .

The stars have found a blazing course
   In a vast curve that cuts through space; 
Enough for us to feel that force
       Swinging us through the days.

Enough that we have strength to sing
   And fight and somehow scorn the grave; 
That Life’s too bold and bright a thing
       To question or to save.

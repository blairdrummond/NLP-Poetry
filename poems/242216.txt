It is very hot—92 today—to be wearing 
a stocking cap, but the adolescent swaggering 
through the grocery store automatic door 
doesn’t seem to mind; does not even appear 
to be perspiring. The tugged-down hat 
is part of his carefully orchestrated outfit: 
bagging pants, screaming t-shirt, high-topped 
shoes. The young woman who yells to her friends 
from an open pickup window is attired 
for summer season in strapless stretch 
tube top, slipping down toward bountiful 
cleavage valley. She tugs it up in front 
as she races toward the two who have 
just passed a cigarette between them 
like a baton on a relay team. Her white 
chest gleams like burnished treasure 
as they giggle loudly there in the corner 
and I glance down to see what costume 
I have selected to present myself to 
the world today. I smile; it’s my sky blue 
shirt with large deliberately faded Peace sign, 
smack dab in the middle, plus grey suede 
Birkenstocks—a message that “I lived through 
the sixties and am so proud.” None of the 
young look my way. I round the corner and 
walk into Evening descending.﻿

title : Superhero Pregnant Woman

author : Jessy Randall

text : 
Her sense of smell is ten times stronger.   
And so her husband smells funny;    
she rolls away from him in the bed.   
She even smells funny to herself,   
but cannot roll away from that.   

Why couldn’t she get a more useful superpower?   
Like the ability to turn invisible, or fly?   

The refrigerator laughs at her from its dark corner,   
knowing she will have to open it some time   
and surrender to its villainous odors.

title : Vacant Blues

author : Urayoán Noel

text : 
I swallow a pill but there is no cure
A city map won’t get me where I want to go
 
Scaling the scaffold,
mindless of the mall,
unaware of driveways
where housewives dodge the wrecking ball,
I crawl outside these vacant blues
 
and into the contours of your eyes

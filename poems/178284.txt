title : Ironing After Midnight

text : 
Your mother called it 
"doing the pressing," 
and you know now 
how right she was. 
There is something urgent here. 
Not even the hiss 
under each button 
or the yellow business 
ground in at the neck 
can make one instant 
of this work seem unimportant. 
You've been taught 
to turn the pocket corners 
and pick out the dark lint 
that collects there. 
You're tempted to leave it, 
but the old lessons 
go deeper than habits. 
Everyone else is asleep. 
The odor of sweat rises 
when you do 
under the armpits, 
the owner's particular smell 
you can never quite wash out. 
You'll stay up. 
You'll have your way, 
the final stroke 
and sharpness 
down the long sleeves, 
a truly permanent edge.

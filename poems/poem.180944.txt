Poems for Weddings



Act III, Scene xiii, Air XXVIIa??a??Green Sleevesa??
Since laws were made, for every degree,
To curb vice in others, as well as me,
I wonder we hana??t better company
         Upon Tyburn tree.
But gold from law can take out the sting;
And if rich men, like us, were to swing,
a??Twould thin the land, such numbers to string
         Upon Tyburn tree.

Rhymed Stanza

I've been list'nin' to them lawyers
      In the court house up the street,
An' I've come to the conclusion
      That I'm most completely beat.
Fust one feller riz to argy,
      An' he boldly waded in
As he dressed the tremblin' pris'ner
      In a coat o' deep-dyed sin.

Why, he painted him all over
      In a hue o' blackest crime,
An' he smeared his reputation
      With the thickest kind o' grime,
Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',
      In a misty way and dim,
How the Lord had come to fashion
      Sich an awful man as him.

Then the other lawyer started,
      An' with brimmin', tearful eyes,
Said his client was a martyr
      That was brought to sacrifice.
An' he give to that same pris'ner
      Every blessed human grace,
Tell I saw the light o' virtue
      Fairly shinin' from his face.

Then I own 'at I was puzzled
      How sich things could rightly be;
An' this aggervatin' question
      Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.
So, will some one please inform me,
      An' this mystery unroll?
How an angel an' a devil
      Can persess the self-same soul?

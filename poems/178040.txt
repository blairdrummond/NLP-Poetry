author : Louise Bogan

text : 
To me, one silly task is like another. 
I bare the shambling tricks of lust and pride.   
This flesh will never give a child its mother,— 
Song, like a wing, tears through my breast, my side,   
And madness chooses out my voice again,   
Again. I am the chosen no hand saves:   
The shrieking heaven lifted over men,   
Not the dumb earth, wherein they set their graves.

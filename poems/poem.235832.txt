The Name Drawn from the Names 
Juan Ramon Jimenez 
1881-1958

Spain
Religion, God & the Divine



If I have created a world for you, in your place, 
god, you had to come to it confident, 
and you have come to it, to my refuge, 
because my whole world was nothing but my hope. 

   I have been saving up my hope 
in language, in a spoken name, a written name; 
I had given a name to everything, 
and you have taken the place 
of all these names. 

   Now I can hold back my movement 
inside the coal of my continual living and being, 
as the flame reins itself back inside the red coal, 
surrounded by air that is all blue fire; 
now I am my own sea that has been suddenly stopped somewhere, 
the sea I used to speak of, but not heavy, 
stiffened into waves of an awareness filled with light, 
and all of them moving upward, upward. 

   All the names that I gave 
to the universe that I created again for you 
are now all turning into one name, into one 
god. 

   The god who, in the end, is always 
the god created and recreated and recreated 
through grace and never through force. 
The God. The name drawn from the names.

Spooky summer on the horizon I’m gazing at 
from my window into the streets 
That’s where it’s going to be where everyone is 
walking around, looking around out in the open 
suspecting each other’s heart to open fire 
all over the streets 
                              like streets you read about every day 
who are the network we travel through on the way to the center   
which is energy filling life 
and bursting with joy all over the screen 
                                                             I can’t sit still any longer! 

I want to go where I’m not feeling so bad 
Get off this little island before the bridges break   
(my heart is a sore thing too) 
No I want to sit in the middle watching movies   
then go to bed in my head 
Someone is banging on it with a heavy stick like the enemy 
who is he going to be turns into a face you can’t recognize 
then vanishes behind a window behind a gun   
Like the lonely hero stalking the main street   
cries out Where are you? I just want to know 
all the angles of death possible under the American sky! 

I can hardly see for all the buildings polluting the sky   
until it changes into a barrage of bottles 
then clears up for a second while you breathe 
and you realize you’e still as alive as ever and want to be   
but would like to be somewhere else perhaps Africa   
Start all over again as the race gets darker and darker   
and the world goes on the way I always thought it would 
For the winner is someone we recognize out of our collective past   
which is turning over again in the grave 

                                    It is so important when one dies you replace her   
                                    and never waste a minute

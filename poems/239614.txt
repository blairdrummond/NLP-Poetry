And now the silver, ripping sound of white on white, the satin,
 light snow torn
 under wheels, car bang metally grenading, and the wood poles,
 whipping, loom—
  

                                     ¤
 
 I have always wanted to sing a song of praise
  
 for the unscathed: myself
 stepping from the fractured car whose black axle’s one inch
 from gone; slim pole slicing cable
  
 up to sheet metal, seat foam, corduroy
 (like butter, the mechanic will later
 tell me, poking a stiff finger through the cloth),
 to pierce the exact point
  
 I was supposed to sit, stopping
 because praise begins where pain
 transfigures itself,
 stoppered by a deeper kind of joy: so I
 transfigure myself from driver
  
 to survivor, the blessed Lazarine failure
  
 bolting up and opening her eyes.
 And here are the thousand wrecks
 from a life configured in snow before me: myself,
 at five, pulled from the burning car seat;
 at twelve, bleeding from the scalp
 after the car throws me from my bike; at fourteen,
 tumbling over the slick hood rushing;
 sockets of windows with glass
 bashed out into a translucent, toothy ring; lights
 and bumpers clipped clean off; tires burst; deer
 gravitationally hurled through my windshield; brakes
 given out and worse,
  
 the icy loop de loops
 on roads, the trucker’s 18 fat wheels squealing—
 All the ways technology should have killed me
  
 and didn’t.
 Praise for my death-hungry luck!
 And all the manner in which I’ve failed it—
 marriage lost,
  
 buried in the blanks of white space, my solitude
 at the Greyhound station
 knowing no one to retrieve me,
 carless among the other pressed tight
 to their own disaster or boredom—
 unbearably young mothers,
  
 drifters, boy soldiers
 shoulder to shoulder with the insane, weaving
 the same thread of conversation back and forth
 between ourselves. How
  
 could this happen to me
 at this age, at this stage, how
 did I not notice, and will you put this seat up?
 and will you lend me this quarter? and will you 
 call me a cab when we get back home?
  
 The young man in the seat before me, head
 full of zigzagging tight braids says,
  
 Sure you can dig up that ballot box in Florida
 and while you’re at it look up all the bones
 buried in the Everglades, repeats it
  
 for the amusement of the woman across from him,
 who knows a presidential failure like she knows herself,
 and when we pass my accident on the road points
 and whistles, snickers:  Bet you no one walked away from that one.
  
 For this, and for all these things: praise
  
 to the white plains of Wyoming, highway coiled
 like a length of rime-colored rope; to snow
 broiling in the sunlight so that the landscape
 takes on a nuclear glow, so bright
  
 we have to shield our eyes from it. Praise
 for myself playing at morbidity
 because I thought I had a right to it
  
 as if flesh had to follow spirit
 to such a pure depth the bones themselves
 could not rest but must be broken, nerves
 singed then ripped out, the heart clenched madly in its chest.
  
 As if I had nothing except this white earth, this
 smashed car to praise
  
 what I knew before and know 
 even better now, the hills
 cold as a hip bone and tufted with ice. Praise
 to my youth and to my age, praise
  
 to ambition and small-mindedness,
 the kind I recognize and the kind
 I am soon to recognize; praise
  
 to self-hatred for it keeps me alive, and praise
 for the splinters of delight that can pierce it.
 Praise for wood pole, praise for glass.
 Praise for muscle, praise for bone.
  
 The sky is bright as a bowl on a nurse’s table today.
  
 And the sun gleams into it as our bus slides by,
 the light of us a wash of gold illuminating
 bodies lost, bodies regained; gleaming
  
 like my heart here, on this earth,
 bloody and still beating.

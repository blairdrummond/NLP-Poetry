title : A Night in Brooklyn

author : D. Nurkse

text : 
We undid a button, 
turned out the light, 
and in that narrow bed 
we built the great city— 
water towers, cisterns,   
hot asphalt roofs, parks, 
septic tanks, arterial roads, 
Canarsie, the intricate channels, 
the seacoast, underwater mountains, 
bluffs, islands, the next continent, 
using only the palms of our hands 
and the tips of our tongues, next 
we made darkness itself, by then 
it was time for dawn 
and we closed our eyes   
and counted to ourselves 
until the sun rose 
and we had to take it all to pieces 
for there could be only one Brooklyn.

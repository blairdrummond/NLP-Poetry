It is not the angel riding a goat, 
trying to make him go. It does no work 
with refusal or guilt, which loves 
only its contorted self. But fancies instead 
my terrier’s long pink tongue, 
how it teases out the bone’s marrow, 
tasting with all its muscle. 

The angel is silver, but so is the goat 
and the box on which they perch, 
a Victorian gesture in the mansion 
where I spent the fall. They have followed 
me home, their permanent shine presuming, 
while around me, everything withered, 
slowly froze, and began its turn 
toward white. The snow 
is nothing but a great emptiness, 
and I’m tired of trying to find a secret there. 
But look—one leaf 
skittering across the glazed surface 
catches its stem to stand upright, 
the shape of a hand waving.

What is this tint that in the shrill cress
 Will never cease to trouble us and in the fields
 Gives prick and praise for Beauty?
 And said birds that feed on berries
 Are perviousâ€”and shook the snow from his thighs.
 I thought of nothing carefully, but of snow, and the birds.
 Then kissed the cup and sipped a little
 Though almost choked drank slowly
 Tickled with strange measure
 She faked a pretty anger
 I entertained the night with fantastic, empty pleasure
 We went as far as the ivie-bush
 And ivie-crowns upon our heads
 And carried her kiss untouched and entire
 Then all was fresh, inclined
 To wriggle and nussle and lascivious
 Ardent leaps. In the thickest of the wood
 Bid him kiss close and often
 And directed him to her fancie
 The ground had a sweeter scent, the boughs a blush
 One fruit, rare and rich, would outdo many together
 She was wild to climb the tree
 Nor would she be forbidden
 She seized the apple and put it in her bosom.

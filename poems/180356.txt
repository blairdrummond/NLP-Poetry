Today's the rider's birthday. 

I see you're already lower-casing him... 

Would you rather I... 

What is this "I." You have none. 

Today's the rider's birthday. 

Except he's dead. 

In a contrary mood today? 

Not in the way you'd think. 

I'm you're friend, remember? And I can't hurt you. I have no body. 

Neither does Krang. 

K-----? 

The bodiless brain. The Ninja Turtles' nemesis. The guy who oversees 
all of their activities. 

And yet you carry him in your pocket like a good luck charm. You perplex 
your son who can't see the humor in your perversity because to him Krang is 
just, to put it plainly, disgusting. 

Just his brain. On the show and the Nintendo game his naked 
brain is always 
         safely encased within 
                   a robot's body 

where his stomach 
         and not his head 
                   ought to be. 

Ought? I thought we had done with the realm of could-have-been. The realm 
of shoulds. 

Who is ever done with—anything? 
Just because I agree with Marie-Louise Von Franz's 
                     imprecation 
                     "no more shoulds" 
          doesn't mean I'm freed from the    actuality. 

And just because the rider is dead 
doesn't mean that today isn't 
his birthday. 

April 17. I'm fine, really. 

I believe you. 

But the week has been—. 

I know. But think of it this way: you're lucky that you can break down. 

I kept scratching my brain in imagination trying to remember if this was 
the week when B died a year ago. And J the same week the year before. 

After each death something went wrong with your body. 

All right, all right. Even though I had the flu I dragged myself to the gym 
to stretch out on the mats and listen to some calming music on my 
Walkman. This was going well. I had my arms and legs extended as far as 
possible in the opposite direction and I could feel my lungs release..., 
but when I reached for my toes I...convulsed and burst into tears. 

Good thing you'd worn your sunglasses. 

Yeah. I knew that the tears could have been mistaken for sweat and the 
groans for... 

and while it was days before the date, as if emblazoned (would stare me 
down-to-distraction) I just could not stop thinking about the intimate 
quiet moments we shared; our rare and wonderful moments of true soli- 
tude together...; the unforced gentleness and sense of mutuality...: 

Buber... 

That's so unimportant. The point is that he had internalized the lessons; 
it was in his nature to be that way. 

I don't see what's so strange. His birthday was approaching. You were sad. 
That's perfectly normal. 

But what pierced me at that moment like an axe was the recognition 
that I never had 
         a    conversation with my (blood) father. 

Don't be dumbfounded. My feelings about the two men are always in 
dialogue, crissing and crossing. 

Lying in that relaxed position on the exercise mat 
listening to the intervals 
in Ry Cooder's mesmerizing Paris, Texas score, it 
                  hit me that as my father's 
birthday approached, or the hour 
of his suicide neared, 
that I felt mildly aware, mildly    sad, 
but not remotely devastated and torn that I had lost 

someone with whom I had an intimacy that could 

never be repeated. 

Nothing can—. 

You know I don't mean it that way. 

Then be precise. 

Someone who, at least in crucial times, communicated a warmth and 
love and care without 

competing with you and undercutting you at every instant like 
your blood father. And your grandfather—. 

Thanks. 

That's what I'm here for. 

So I was torn by a new perplexity with regard to my real father. I never 
lived with him but we spent countless hours alone together and he was 
often, before he hit the bottle, quite friendly, easy-going, low pressure. 

A compañero. 

We liked to hobo around together. 

But even looking at clusters of the best moments we had in each 
other's presence we still never had 
                            a conversation. He had his 
mind made up about me and, with his game-plan fully laid out, 
chose to employ this or that tactic to 
                              edify, or instruct..., to 
lead me onto better paths 

for I am in no way criticizing his motivation in trying to help 
me 
                   GROW 

it was just that he had no 

                   EARS 

He knew in advance anything I could possibly think or say. 

But it wasn't personal. It was just the way he was. You brought 
a friend to dinner who was stationed on a ship outside Nankeng 
Harbor. Your father appeared to listen to his sea stories 
    —and the thing that "most blew his mind"— 
       when the missle, launched 
    from the ship, landed 
                     "directly on" 
    a peasant hoeing rice who "didn't know where the hell 
                   he was going" 
    and blew him away completely 
    and the sailors laughed 

       —and your friend came apart— 

and while your FACE showed proper astonishment 
                   your      FATHER 
         just pawed the place mat 

         to rid it of imaginary crumbs 

         and with stern and solemn nods 

         that withheld surprise at all costs 

and gravity of tone worthy of Lincoln! 

told your friend that the gist                                  of war was       boredom 

and he, perhaps unused to such practiced delivery during 
"informal" gatherings 

took this in then whispered wide-eyed that he could not believe 
how your father could know everything he'd gone through 
when he'd never gone through it 

and while his sadism was not in full flower in such isolated 
instances it was 

a drag. 

No wonder I was touched when Sam agreed to an evening of five-card- 
stud on one condition: "no poker faces"! 

Your father's mask was his face. 

No—depth? Interior—life? 

No - but that he cared more about the impression he made than about what 
you or your friend were undergoing. 

He was always onstage, your father. Preening for posterity in a void of his 
own invention. 

Ok. 

He was never, or always and only, himself.

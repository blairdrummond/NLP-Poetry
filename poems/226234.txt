title : The Spire

In the Bavarian steeple, on the hour, 
two figures emerge from their scalloped house   
carrying sledges that they clap, in turn,   
against the surface of the bell. By legend   
they are summer and winter, youth and age,   
as though the forces of plenty and of loss   
played equally on the human soul, extracted   
easily the same low bronze note spreading   
upward from the encumbrance of the village,   
past alluvial fields to the pocked highland   
where cattle shift their massive heads   
at this dissonance, this faint redundant   
pressure in the ears, in the air. 

From the village, the mountain seems 
a single stone, a single blank completion.   
Seeing the summit pierce the abstract heavens,   
we reconstruct the valley on the mountain— 
a shepherd propped against his crook, birds   
enthralled on a branch, the branch feathering   
the edge of the canvas—transposing   
such forms as can extend the flawed earth   
and embody us, intact, unaltering, among   
the soft surprising trees of childhood, 
mimosa, honey locust and willow. 

Wood in the midst of woods, the village   
houses are allied in a formal shape   
beside a stream, the streets concluding 
at the monument. Again the ravishing moment   
of the bell: the townspeople, curious 
or accustomed, stop to count the strokes,   
odd or even—the confectioner counting out   
the lavendar candies for his customer, 
the butcher, the greengrocer, the surgeon   
and the constable—as the housewife 
stands on the stoop, shaking her mop, 
and sees the dust briefly veil the air, 
an algebra of swirling particles.

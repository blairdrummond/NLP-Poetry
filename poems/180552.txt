Dog days doggone dog-tired dogwork of summer, 
mowing the grass we're all coming to 

the dog tags of you, me, I, we, stashed in a box, 
doghouse throwaways. Even the namesake 

tree whose blossoms some call Jesus-flowers 
for the rust-grooved tips of the petals 

as if nails now removed had indented 
the shape of a cross, betrays my mood 

how all those springs ago 
seeing our tree nailed with bloody after bloody 

crucifix I said this beauty's no foo-foo 
and sure enough my dog-weary dearie 

mowing today, the spring long gone, 
I brush a limb on whose tired leaves mites amble 

the edible thoroughfares and as if to confirm it, 
our neighbor's mutt runs along the fence yapping 

dogwood dogwood dogwood as the mower chugs on, 
our train leaving for the city beneath the grass.

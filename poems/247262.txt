title : That Bright Grey Eye

author : Hilda Morley

text : 
The grey sky, lighter & darker 
greys,
            lights between & delicate 
            lavenders also 
blue-greys in smaller strokes,
                                                      & swashes 
of mauve-grey on the Hudson—
                                                           openings 
of light to the blue oblong 
off-center
                   where the door to the warehouse 
shows—
                the larger smearings darkening
                                                                          deep 
into blues
                             So alight that sky, 
                             late August, 
early evening,
                             I had to 
gasp at it,
                   stand there hardly moving 
to breathe it,       using 
whatever my body gave me,
                                                    at 
that moment       attending to it, 
thinking:
                  Turner, he should have 
seen it,
              he would have given it 
back to us,
                     not let it die away
                                                                       And that other 
evening, walking down Bank Street from marketing,
the sky fiery over the river,
                                                  luminous but 
hot in its flowering also,
                                              rich in color 
as Venice seen by Guardi—more aflame even, 
the sky moving in a pulse,
                                                its fire breathing 
in a pulse verging on danger—mane of a lioness 
affronted.
                         That brilliance—the eye of the lion 
filled to the lids with 
flame
                  And his eyes, Turner's, that bright grey eye 
at seventy-six,
                           "brilliant as 
the eye of a child"
                                 who grew his thumbnail 
in the shape of an eagle's claw,
                                                          the better 
to use it in painting
                                     In Kirby Lonsdale, Yorkshire, 
where Turner first drew mountain-landscapes, 
                                      I found Blake's Marriage 
of Heaven and Hell—sold for two guineas, 1821 
& Turner aged 46 that year
                                                  & there I read: 
"And when thou seest 
an Eagle, thou seest a portion of genius.
                                                                         Lift up 
thy head," says Blake.
                                        These afternoons now, 
                                         late in September, 76, 
the sky, the river are lit up
at the end of Bank Street, at Bethune.
                                                                     The pavement 
trembles with light pouring 
upon it
               We are held in it. 
We smile.
                   I hold my breath to see if 
the cashier in the supermarket 
will be gentle with the old lady who cannot 
read the price-tag on 
a loaf of bread.
                            Then I breathe freely, 
for yes, she is helpful, yes, she is 
kind.
                   Outside on 
the pavement, the light pouring itself away 
is the light in the eagle's 
eye        (or the eye of 
a child)
                              (I saw it in a man's eye once: 
                              but he's dead now more than 
                              four years) 
Drawing heat out of 
surfaces,
                      the light is 
without calculation,
                                    is a munificence now, 
is justified.

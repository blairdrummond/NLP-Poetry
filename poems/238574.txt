title : Lines For An Epic (Pagano, the Arc of Night Fallen ....)

author : Sotère Torregian

text : 
Pagano, the arc of night fallen
Ice on the underhanded lilies cakewalk
Underground, in the garage caverns of Galatian eocene
gift of the man in the panther-skin
trailed by detectives of the fanfare aboveworld
  hewer or warrior   of the blue muscles in the saga-like

Cranial canopy of the newscast's morning December
All are gone and connect him with the language
of light and darkness refusal   out of the   flowers of the staff
came a dove by that time the apple will be old and forgotten
in telecast streams of your eyes
wife in symphony of blue porcelain your symphony in blue

John Gordon Boyd
 died on the birthday
 of three remarkable, and remarkably different, writers:
 Heinrich Heine, Kenneth Patchen, Ross McDonald
  
 John, too, was just as remarkable, blessed with an inherent “graciousness”
 and with extraordinary eyes & ears…
  
  
 I think of two texts
 on the grievous occasion of his death:
  
 “Religion does not help me.
 The faith that others give to what is unseen,
 I give to what I can touch, and look at.
 My Gods dwell in temples
 made with hands.”
  — Oscar Wilde, in De Profundis
  
  
 and two lines in Rainier Maria Rilke,
 John’s favorite poet,
 that say it all…
  
 Was tun Sie, Gott,
 Wenn ich bin stürbe?
  
 “What will you do, 
 God, when I am dead?”

Sonnet

I pace the sounding sea-beach and behold 
      How the voluminous billows roll and run, 
      Upheaving and subsiding, while the sun 
      Shines through their sheeted emerald far unrolled, 
And the ninth wave, slow gathering fold by fold 
      All its loose-flowing garments into one, 
      Plunges upon the shore, and floods the dun 
      Pale reach of sands, and changes them to gold. 
So in majestic cadence rise and fall 
      The mighty undulations of thy song, 
      O sightless bard, England's Maeonides! 
And ever and anon, high over all 
      Uplifted, a ninth wave superb and strong, 
      Floods all the soul with its melodious seas.

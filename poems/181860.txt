The flowering sea and the mountains in the moon’s waning 
the great stone close to the Barbary figs and the asphodels 
the jar that refused to go dry at the end of day 
and the closed bed by the cypress trees and your hair 
golden; the stars of the Swan and that other star, Aldebaran. 

I’ve kept a rein on my life, kept a rein on my life, travelling 
among yellow trees in driving rain 
on silent slopes loaded with beech leaves, 
no fire on their peaks; it’s getting dark. 
I’ve kept a rein on my life; on your left hand a line 
a scar at your knee, perhaps they exist 
on the sand of the past summer perhaps 
they remain there where the north wind blew as I hear 
an alien voice around the frozen lake. 
The faces I see do not ask questions nor does the woman 
bent as she walks giving her child the breast. 
I climb the mountains; dark ravines; the snow-covered 
plain, into the distance stretches the snow-covered plain, they ask nothing 
neither time shut up in dumb chapels nor 
hands outstretched to beg, nor the roads. 
I’ve kept a rein on my life whispering in a boundless silence 
I no longer know how to speak nor how to think; whispers 
like the breathing of the cypress tree that night 
like the human voice of the night sea on pebbles 
like the memory of your voice saying ‘happiness’. 

I close my eyes looking for the secret meeting-place of the waters 
under the ice the sea’s smile, the closed wells 
groping with my veins for those veins that escape me 
there where the water-lilies end and that man 
who walks blindly across the snows of silence. 
I’ve kept a rein on my life, with him, looking for the water that touches you 
heavy drops on green leaves, on your face 
in the empty garden, drops in the motionless reservoir 
striking a swan dead in its white wings 
living trees and your eyes riveted. 

This road has no end, has no relief, however hard you try 
to recall your childhood years, those who left, those 
lost in sleep, in the graves of the sea, 
however much you ask bodies you’ve loved to stoop 
under the harsh branches of the plane trees there 
where a ray of the sun, naked, stood still 
and a dog leapt and your heart shuddered, 
the road has no relief; I’ve kept a rein on my life. 

                                                                        The snow 
and the water frozen in the hoofmarks of the horses.

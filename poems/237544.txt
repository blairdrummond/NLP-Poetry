title : enuresis

author : Cid Corman

text : 
Terror is not – Ed –
sitting in one’s piss.
I know – I’ve sat there –

I’ve slept there and did
most of my childhood.
That was warmth – in fact –

and comfort – in spite
of the unconcealed
unconcealable

smell. Terror? That was
and always will be
Mother cursing Dad

and there there I am
alone in that night
hearing that door slam.

title : Naked in the Ditches

author : Richard Owens

text : 
phlegmatic on my bier
 no regrets—my body bears
 truth stem to stern
 beginning with the hips
  
 who am of common stock
 looking to the sea
 face ground—nothing now
 conjured from dust
  
 suffering—hung by the heels
 sought occasion
 as will was never conquered
 to see the host broken
  
 a swinging scythe—the dance
 this most pleasant to me
 so make moan of the old days
 say why should love live

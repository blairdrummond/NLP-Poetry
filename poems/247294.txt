title : Now I knew I lost her — (1274)

author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
Now I knew I lost her —
Not that she was gone —
But Remoteness travelled
On her Face and Tongue. 

Alien, though adjoining
As a Foreign Race —
Traversed she though pausing
Latitudeless Place.

Elements Unaltered —
Universe the same
But Love's transmigration —
Somehow this had come —

Henceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much for —
His is Penury
Not who toils for Freedom
Or for Family
But the Restitution
Of Idolatry.

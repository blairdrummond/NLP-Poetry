The mask that burns like a violin, the mask
 that sings only dead languages, that loves
 the destruction of being put on. The mask
 that sighs like a woman even though
 a woman wears it. The mask beaded with
 freshwater pearls, with seeds. The plumed mask,
 the mask with a sutured mouth, a moonface,
 with a healed gash that means harvest. A glower
 that hides wanting. A grotesque pucker. Here’s
 a beaked mask, a braided mask, here’s a mask
 without eyes, a mask that looks like a mask
 but isn’t—please don’t try to unribbon it.
 The mask that snows coins, the mask full of wasps.
 Lace mask to net escaping thoughts. Pass me
 the rouged mask, the one made of sheet music.
 Or the jackal mask, the hide-bound mask
 that renders lovers identical with night.

Rhymed Stanza

(from Twelfth Night)
Come away, come away, death, 
    And in sad cypress let me be laid. 
Fly away, fly away, breath; 
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid. 
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, 
             O, prepare it! 
My part of death, no one so true 
         Did share it. 

Not a flower, not a flower sweet, 
    On my black coffin let there be strown. 
Not a friend, not a friend greet 
    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. 
A thousand thousand sighs to save, 
             Lay me, O, where 
Sad true lover never find my grave, 
             To weep there!

text : 
It is too much a part of things,
 even though the source is not within.
  
 In small American cities
 with and without universities,
  
 it keeps a constant presence
 in the Confucian sense,
  
 the inner arriving to match
 the outer, spirit not separate
  
 from matter (the latter illusion
 left by the missions
  
 the people have made such fine
 use of). There are times
  
 when you have to pretend
 to embrace an idea or befriend
  
 your adversaries. If constantly
 misinterpreted, use the mystery
  
 as currency. You have to start
 somewhere. Be wise: depart
  
 from where they’ve already put you.
 A country itself can’t betray you.

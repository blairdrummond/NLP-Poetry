title : A Hymn for Berryman

author : Charles Ghigna

text : 
You marched into the gray eyes of dawn
 feeling older than the bones
 that held their ground
 like grazing, aged cattle
 waiting, eyes closed to the wind,
 on a winter, slaughter morning.
 You searched through the fog for a sign,
 but there was no sun to burn the way,
 no burst of rainbow bridge
 to keep you from the cattle call.

title : The Abandoned Hotel

author : Zachary Schomburg

text : 
Inside the woods is an abandoned hotel.
 Trees grow in the lobby
 and up through the rooms.
 Limbs jut out through the windows.
 It looks like outside
 inside.
  
 I climb the trees
 through 1000 rooms.
  
 I look for you
 in each of them.
  
 You’re a long shiny line.

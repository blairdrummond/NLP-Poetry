title : Houdini

author : Kay Ryan

text : 
Each escape 
involved some art, 
some hokum, and 
at least a brief 
incomprehensible 
exchange between 
the man and metal 
during which the 
chains were not 
so much broken 
as he and they 
blended. At the 
end of each such   
mix he had to 
extract himself. It 
Was the hardest 
part to get right 
routinely: breaking 
back into the   
same Houdini.

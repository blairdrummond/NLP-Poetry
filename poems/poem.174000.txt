Sonnet

On the Lord General Fairfax at the Siege of Colchester
Fairfax, whose name in arms through Europe rings 
      Filling each mouth with envy, or with praise, 
      And all her jealous monarchs with amaze 
      And rumours loud, that daunt remotest kings; 
Thy firm unshak'n virtue ever brings 
      Victory home, though new rebellions raise 
      Their hydra heads, and the false north displays 
      Her brok'n league, to imp their serpent wings: 
O yet a nobler task awaits thy hand; 
      For what can war but endless war still breed? 
      Till Truth and Right from Violence be freed, 
And Public Faith clear'd from the shameful brand 
      Of Public Fraud. In vain doth Valour bleed 
      While Avarice and Rapine share the land.

title : A Sheaf of Pleasant Voices

author : John Yau

text : 
There are rooftops 
made of cloud remnants

gathered by a trader
dabbling in car parts and burlap

At night, I dive onto the breeze 
fermenting above the dirt

and dream that I am a crocodile
a tin of shoe polish, an audience of two

In the morning, before the smallest yawn 
becomes a noodle, I am offered

a ribbon of yellow smoke
I opt for fuzzy rocks and clawed water

and, of course, the perishable window 
I am one of the last computer

chain errors to be illuminated 
I tell you there are rooftops

on which the moon stops 
being a cold jewel

And one by one the mountains 
begin their descent from

the chambers of a lost book

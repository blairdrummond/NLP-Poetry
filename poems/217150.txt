To George Herbert
Aspiration's breath, millennial trance, 
two-pointed ladder propped in a void; 
busy buzzard claws, verbs on a leash, 
slow blush of brain damage on a plate. 

Stunned journey of dust. A holey sock. 
Grind of an afternoon's axles, abandoned 
juggernaut in a field; inhabited interval 
with a pencil stub, curved strips of silence: 

postbox for the inner ear. Tarantula's footstep, 
a weight of light: inadvertent sky in the skull. 
Wishbone couture: promiscuous secret, 

peepshow in the street. Paraphrase of planets. 
Ocean in a tablespoon. Ordinary in the ordinary: 
nothing come of anything, matter unpossessed.

title : Psalm

author : Philip Memmer

text : 
For you are like their parent 
                                       who is never pleased 
                  and they are like your parent 
                                                            who cannot stay angry 

For you are like a child 

For age after age 
                                       they conceive you 
                  and despite the pain of birth 
                                                            they bring you forth 

For they call you perfect   
                                       though your hands are missing 
                  and though your heart does not beat 
                                                            they give you a name 

For they remember you 

For they hold you blameless 
                                       in their sorrow 
                  though they were surely happiest 
                                                            before you arrived 

For your identical twin 
                                       they name Silence 
                  and when they feed Silence 
                                                            he grows 

For they love Silence 
                                       as they would have loved you 
                  even more perhaps 
                                                            as old age comes 
and they forget 
                                       the sound of your cry 
                  and where the exact spot was 
                                                            they spread your ashes 

and how those ashes 
                                       tasted 
                  when the wind blew them 
                                                            into their mouths 

Father in their dreams 
                                       they worry still 
                  perhaps it is you 
                                                            who lives among them 

and not Silence 
                                       after all   
                  mistakes happen 
                                                            after all 

how would anyone know 

and the midwives 
                                       forgive them 
                  forgive them 
                                                            were only human

title : Ring Out Your Bells

author : Sir Philip Sidney

text : 
Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;
For Love is dead
      All love is dead, infected
With plague of deep disdain;
      Worth, as nought worth, rejected,
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.
      From so ungrateful fancy,
      From such a female franzy,
      From them that use men thus,
      Good Lord, deliver us!

Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said
That Love is dead?
      His death-bed, peacock's folly;
His winding-sheet is shame;
      His will, false-seeming holy;
His sole exec'tor, blame.
      From so ungrateful fancy,
      From such a female franzy,
      From them that use men thus,
      Good Lord, deliver us!

Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,
For Love is dead;
      Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth
My mistress' marble heart,
      Which epitaph containeth,
"Her eyes were once his dart."
      From so ungrateful fancy,
      From such a female franzy,
      From them that use men thus,
      Good Lord, deliver us!

Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;
Love is not dead;
      Love is not dead, but sleepeth
In her unmatched mind,
      Where she his counsel keepeth,
Till due desert she find.
      Therefore from so vile fancy,
      To call such wit a franzy,
      Who Love can temper thus,
      Good Lord, deliver us!

title : The Package

text : 
It was a green barn coat from L. L. Bean   
That he had ordered, thinking of her   
Walking the snowy hillside of his dream   
Though she detested the style and color. 

That it arrived two days after he died   
Did not dispose her to detest it less   
Though she may have wished she did,   
The way she wished she’d kept house 

More neatly or baked instead of fried,   
For every coronary’s a latent homicide— 
If not what we did, what we did not do.   
If not what we said, what we did not say. 

In this, the inner jury’s always out,   
No different for man or woman— 
For everyone over forty, the human   
Condition is grief complicated by guilt. 

It’s unexceptional really, what’s left 
After deaths. We’re thrown back on our own taste.   
That coat, for instance. If that was a gift, 
She would have to hide to throw it away.

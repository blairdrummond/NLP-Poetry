(a myth of consequences)
The ivy across our back fence tangles gray 
into a green evening light.

How a second emptiness 
un-punctuates the first.

Disloyal,
we attempt to construct.

An ache will tighten 
but not form.

Making impossible
even this upsurge of crows across our sightline.

The Mayans invented zero so as not to ignore even the gods 
who wouldn't carry their burdens.

Too slippery as prayer, too effortless 
as longing.

Our problem was preparation. Premeditation 
neutered any rage potential.

Years later, the spine of our backyard 
appears to have always been crooked.

White jasmine, dove-calm in the lattice, is not 
a finely crafted lure.

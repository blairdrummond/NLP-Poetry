Epigram, Couplet

When the last fight is lost, the last sword broken;   
The last call sounded, the last order spoken;   
When from the field where braver hearts lie sleeping, 
Faint, and athirst, and blinded, I come creeping, 
With not one waving shred of palm to bring you, 
With not one splendid battle-song to sing you, 
O Love, in my dishonor and defeat, 
Your measureless compassion will be sweet.

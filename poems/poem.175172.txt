Epigram, Rhymed Stanza

You are young, and I am older;
      You are hopeful, I am not--
Enjoy life, ere it grow colder--
      Pluck the roses ere they rot.

Teach your beau to heed the lay--
      That sunshine soon is lost in shade--
That now's as good as any day--
      To take thee, Rosa, ere she fade.

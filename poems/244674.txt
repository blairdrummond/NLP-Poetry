title : [Sleeping sister of a farther sky]

author : Karen Volkman

text : 
Sleeping sister of a farther sky,
 dropped from zenith like a tender tone,
 the lucid apex of a scale unknown
 whose whitest whisper is an opaque cry
  
 of measureless frequency, the spectral sigh
 you breath, bright hydrogen and brighter zone
 of fissured carbon, consummated moan
 and ceaseless rapture of a brilliant why.
  
 Will nothing wake you from your livid rest?
 Essence of ether and astral stone
 the stunned polarities your substance weaves
  
 in one bright making, like a dream of leaves
 in the tree’s mind, summered. Or as a brooding bone
 roots constellations in the body’s nest.

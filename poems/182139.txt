Gone to seed, ailanthus, the poverty 
   tree. Take a phrase, then 
fracture it, the pods’ gaudy nectarine shades 
      ripening to parrots taking flight, all crest 
and tail feathers. 
                           A musical idea. 
                                                 Macaws 
   scarlet and violet, 
                               tangerine as a song 
the hue of sunset where my street becomes water 

and down shore this phantom city skyline’s 
   mere hazy silhouette. The alto’s 
liquid geometry weaves a way of thinking, 
      a way of breaking 
synchronistic 
                     through time 
                                        so the girl 
   on the comer 
                      has the bones of my face, 
the old photos, beneath the Kansas City hat, 

black fedora lifting hair off my neck 
   cooling the sweat of a night-long tidal 
pull from bar to bar the night we went 
       to find Bird’s grave. Eric’s chartreuse 
perfume. That 
                   poured-on dress 
                                          I lived days 

and nights inside, 
                           made love 
and slept in, a mesh and slur of zipper 

down the back. Women smoked the boulevards 
   with gardenias after-hours, asphalt shower- 
slick, ozone charging air with sixteenth 
      notes, that endless convertible ride to find 
the grave 
               whose sleep and melody   
                                                 wept neglect 
enough to torch us 
                            for a while 
through snare-sweep of broom on pavement, 

the rumpled musk of lover’s sheets, charred 
   cornices topping crosstown gutted buildings.   
Torches us still—cat screech, matte blue steel 
      of pistol stroked across the victim’s cheek 
where fleet shoes 
                           jazz this dark 
                                                 and peeling 
block, that one. 
                        Vine Street, Olive. 
We had the music, but not the pyrotechnics— 

rhinestone straps lashing my shoes, heels sinking 
   through earth and Eric in casual drag, 
mocha cheekbones rouged, that flawless 
      plummy mouth. A style for moving, 
heel tap and 
                  lighter flick, 
                                       lion moan 
of buses pulling away 
                               through the static 
brilliant fizz of taffeta on nyloned thighs. 

Light mist, etherous, rinsed our faces 
   and what happens when 
you touch a finger to the cold stone 
      that jazz and death played 
down to? 
            Phrases. 
                        Take it all 
   and break forever— 
                              a man 
with gleaming sax, an open sill in summertime, 

and the fire-escape’s iron zigzag tumbles 
   crazy notes to a girl cooling her knees, 
wearing one of those dresses no one wears 
      anymore, darts and spaghetti straps, glitzy 
fabrics foaming 
                        an iron bedstead. 
                                                 The horn’s 
alarm, then fluid brass chromatics. 
                                                    Extravagant 
ailanthus, the courtyard’s poverty tree is spike 
and wing, slate-blue 
                               mourning dove, 
                                                      sudden cardinal flame. 

If you don’t live it, it won’t come out your horn.

title : Gulf Memo

author : Stephen Sandy

text : 
Tell me the way to the wedding
 Tell me the way to the war,
 Tell me the needle you’re threading
 I won’t raise my voice anymore.
  
 And tell me what axe you are grinding
 Where the boy on the bivouac believes,
 What reel you are unwinding
 For the girl in her bed who grieves.
  
 While behind a derrick’s girder
 He watches the sinking sun,
 He asks what he’ll do for murder
 And what he will do for fun.
  
 Will you read him the ways of war
 His Miranda rights in sin,
 Will you tell him what to ignore
 When he studies your discipline?
  
 He dozes off—but he shakes
 In a dream that he is the one
 Death finds abed and wakes
 Just as the night is done.
  
 Tell me what boats go ashore
 Riding the oil-dimmed tide,
 Red streamers and black in store
 For the boy with a pain in his side.
  
 And tell me where they are heading
 Tonight; now tell me the score.
 Tell me the way to their wedding
 I won’t raise my own voice anymore.

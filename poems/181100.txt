title : Rose Thorns

Why do roses need their thorns?   
Some things are little known.   
But thorns of roses   
spring and seize the surface   
of  fey airs   
before the roses come.   
I’ve seen thorns huddle in a harmony alone, 
hunkered down on green, wiry canes,   
smoothed blades of whipping rose stalks,   
and curl their polished tridents   
to night’s call.   
They are like stars   
digging into firmament   
with such desire, 
you don’t quite get it,   
and so healthy that   
they almost have to wound,   
or like bodies that can’t be argued,   
borrowed, tamed.   
The touch of a thorn   
is a wry, deep telling   
of the senses not to bloom 
without a wish to,   
without belief  in pain   
to hold us true.

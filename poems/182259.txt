title : courthouse steps

text : 
to say no more of art than that it makes, by its very distraction 
                     a mode of abiding 



accordingly, its variations:    each type of thread-and-piecework   
                     named double engagement ring, log cabin, or broken dishes    
all built on the same geometric figures— 
                                        precise interception of angle and line 



so too each tale of love is rooted in that first tale:    the poet 
                     descending to the underworld 
                                        finally granted his shade, who'll follow him 
only to disappear again.      perhaps one version has them reunite 
                     affixed in their solo chromospheres the stars, which,   
to the human eye, appear to overlap 



substanceless love 
                                        immune at last to gravity and time— 



in texas (I might as well recount this as a story) there's a town 
                     with a courthouse built on concrete and twisted iron 
edified in red granite, capitals & architrave of red sandstone   

with point and punch, a carver broached the effigy of his muse 
                     he rendered her attractive features, down to the very blush 

                                          of course she spurned him,   
                  of course there was another to whom she turned 
love should not be written in stone but written in water 
                                        (I paraphrase the latin of catullus) 


the sculptor carried on:    not just the face of his beloved   
                     but the face of her other lover: 
                                        snaggle-toothed, wart-peppered, pudgy 
them both, made into ugly caricatures of themselves, as wanton 
                     as the carver perceived them, and as lewd 



                     well, craze and degenerate and crack:   the portraits hold 
though, long since, the participants have dwindled into dirt 
          
                     beautiful.      unbeautiful.      each with an aspect of exactness 



tread light upon this pedestal.      dream instead of a time before 
                     your love disfigured, a time 
                                        withstanding even crass, wind-beaten time itself

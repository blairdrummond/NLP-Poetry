                not straight, but in waves ﻿
It seems every advance in the process
deepens the subject’s relations to
inner objects, happiness in regaining them
 
after feeling adrift and lost, an increased
trust because they appear good
and helpful after all, as in the child
 
step by step, building his relations to
external objects, gaining not only from things
pleasant, but from ways in which the child
 
overcomes frustrations . . . Mrs. A, for instance:
finally walking down familiar streets with a friend:
an attempt at old bonds. Yet moments into the stroll
 
the number of bustling people is too much,
the buildings strange, the sunlight artificial, bleak . . .
so that she has to retreat indoors into
 
a restaurant for a chair, but even there the walls
are buckling, the diners and waiters blurred—
indifferent to what she carries inside, her home
 
suddenly the only tolerable place—
pictures of her boy, his drawings,
in each and every room.

text : 
But isn’t midnight intermittent
Or was that just a whispered nine
A snap of blown light low against the flank of a cow
A likeness of something numberless that only I not knowing the sound 
            might know 
It may have been howled by a circling dog being chastised — threatened —
            by multiples of itself in pursuit of the consolation of knowing that
            everything is real 
It was real
I don’t mean midnight — despite horizon, nipple, and fissure 
I don’t mean
And yet I do — mean, I mean 
A cowering animal woven real
            flickers
                        please pull over
                                    Kierkegaard 
Kierkegaard says knowledge precedes every act but surely there are acts that 
are not preceded by knowledge. Repetitions pass at the door from summer 
to winter. Some slowly. Some quickly. Total strangers. Never saw them 
before. Can’t picture them now. Umbrellas — strange totalities — upheld, 
wheeling.

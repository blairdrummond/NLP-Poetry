Nature, Living, Sorrow & Grieving, Animals

Rhymed Stanza

Man, the egregious egoist, 
(In mystery the twig is bent,) 
Imagines, by some mental twist, 
That he alone is sentient 

Of the intolerable load 
Which on all living creatures lies, 
Nor stoops to pity in the toad 
The speechless sorrow of its eyes. 

He asks no questions of the snake, 
Nor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom 
Where lidless fishes, broad awake, 
Swim staring at a night-mare doom.

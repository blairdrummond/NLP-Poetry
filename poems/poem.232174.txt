I 

Thy soul shall find itself alone 
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone-- 
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry 
Into thine hour of secrecy. 


       II 

Be silent in that solitude, 
   Which is not loneliness--for then 
The spirits of the dead who stood 
   In life before thee are again 
In death around thee--and their will 
Shall overshadow thee: be still. 


       III 

The night, tho' clear, shall frown-- 
And the stars shall look not down 
From their high thrones in the heaven, 
With light like Hope to mortals given-- 
But their red orbs, without beam, 
To thy weariness shall seem 
As a burning and a fever 
Which would cling to thee for ever. 


       IV 

Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, 
Now are visions ne'er to vanish; 
From thy spirit shall they pass 
No more--like dew-drop from the grass. 


       V 

The breeze--the breath of God--is still-- 
And the mist upon the hill, 
Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken, 
Is a symbol and a token-- 
How it hangs upon the trees, 
A mystery of mysteries!

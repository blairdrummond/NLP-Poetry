title : The Language

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
Locate I 
love you some- 
where in 

teeth and   
eyes, bite   
it but 

take care not   
to hurt, you   
want so 

much so   
little. Words   
say everything. 

I 
love you 
again, 

then what   
is emptiness   
for. To 

fill, fill. 
I heard words   
and words full 

of holes   
aching. Speech   
is a mouth.

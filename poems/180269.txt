text : 
Some problems of self-loathing, worry: 
the thumbnail blotched in a bank box 
door grows out, three-quarter moon marrow spot 
filled out with white bruise travels down 
my thumb at regular speed, so when I glance 
down it's what I see left of center, not 
the odd breast, the malformed scruff 
at head, the old thought leaking pain 
on the pages from my brain, which ought 
to be gainfully occupied with rain 
as an emblem of loss and gain, and is not.

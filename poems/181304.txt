title : In Memoriam, July 19, 1914

author : Anna Akhmatova

text : 
We aged a hundred years and this descended 
In just one hour, as at a stroke. 
The summer had been brief and now was ended; 
The body of the ploughed plains lay in smoke. 

The hushed road burst in colors then, a soaring 
Lament rose, ringing silver like a bell. 
And so I covered up my face, imploring 
God to destroy me before battle fell. 

And from my memory the shadows vanished 
Of songs and passions—burdens I'd not need. 
The Almighty bade it be—with all else banished— 
A book of portents terrible to read.

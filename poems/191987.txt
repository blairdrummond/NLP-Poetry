title : Bilbea

author : Carl Sandburg

text : 
(From tablet writing, Babylonian excavations of the 4th millennium B.C.)
Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.
I saw nothing of you anywhere.
I was at the old place and the other girls were there, 
But no Bilbea.

Have you gone to another house? or city?
Why donâ€™t you write?
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.

Tell me how it goes.
Send me some kind of a letter.
And take care of yourself.

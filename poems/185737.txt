I was chasing this blue butterfly down
the road when a car came by and clipped me.   
It was nothing serious, but it angered me and 
I turned around and cursed the driver who didn't 
even slow down to see if I was hurt. Then I 
returned my attention to the butterfly which   
was nowhere to be seen. One of the Doubleday   
girls came running up the street with her toy 
poodle toward me. I stopped her and asked, 
"Have you seen a blue butterfly around here?" 
"It's down near that birch tree near Grandpa's," 
she said. "Thanks," I said, and walked briskly 
toward the tree. It was fluttering from flower 
to flower in Mr. Doubleday's extensive garden,   
a celestial blueness to soothe the weary heart.   
I didn't know what I was doing there. I certain- 
ly didn't want to capture it. It was like 
something I had known in another life, even if 
it was only in a dream, I wanted to confirm it.   
I was a blind beggar on the streets of Cordoba 
when I first saw it, and now, again it was here.

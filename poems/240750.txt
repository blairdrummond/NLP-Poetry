text : 
The orbiting reflector
 Turns night into day: petals ping
  
 Accelerated workers  
          swarm into the plaza
 A blur on the soul’s dead instrument
  
 Everywhere, windows are blanked
 To the same newsreel
  
 I alone
 Inhabit a mockup of the early nineteenth century
  
 I, the great idealist
          who confesses
 On the first page of his diary: Father!
There are no living atoms 
 & the diary answers: Identity
 Is that
 Which is eaten from within
  
 Another man is partially assembled
 On the table
  
 Another module
 Unshrouded, revolves in sunlight
  
          filtered through noise
 A simulated victory
  
 Crawls like a glove
 Animated by music

title : Riptide

author : Norma Cole

text : 

                          There’s a shadow over the city             the light, as usual, framing and erasing 
 Just say you
 dream fires each
 night smoothing each
 collapsing page from
  
 the throat talking
 in a series
 of measures in
 the high desert
  
 the perfect life
 in a series 
 of measured gestures
 an invitation to
  
 see the world
 from a bridge
 that burns in
 the next night

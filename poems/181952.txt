Do you know what’s the unluckiest thing 
In the world, a differential grasshopper 
Said to me. I paused, I put down the 
Diesel grinder I’d been trying to fix, 
I turned off the stealth bomber, I faded 
Away from the faded away pedals, I put up 
Finely embroidered silk panels over the 
Faces of the statues, I pulled the green 
Vacillating amplifier into the hallway, 
I swiveled seven of the chains and 
Loosened the bolts in the balcony, I went 
Into the barn to unlace the cattle and 
Overturn the empty buckets, I put the 
White flag on the mailbox, I cut the 
Telephone wires, I fed the ducks better 
Than I usually feed them, I adjusted the 
Faucets so they’d drip a little, I waved 
At old Mr. Wiley with his smokeless pipe 
And his manpowered plough across the field, 
I moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge, 
I taped the key to the bulldozer to the 
Roof of the canopy, I took the cup of 
Auger bits away from the rabbit hutch,   
I put a padlock on the children’s playhouse, 
I picked up a stick by the sideyard gate, 
I broke it over my knee, I went to the well 
To fill a stone pitcher with cool water,   
I let the donkey & the goats go. I took 
A ladder to the hayloft and took down a   
Suitcase. I could see across the valley 
Down to the river from up there.

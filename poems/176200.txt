title : Ex-Embassy

author : Carol Muske-Dukes

text : 
Sometimes, at dawn, I think I hear   
                                              the high sobbing cry of the muezzin   
                                              hanging in the sky before it’s light   
                                              but then, I drop off to sleep again. 

Behind us is the ex-embassy. 
Its pool a blue mosaic through   
our hedge. The old man 
in robe and wrapped head no longer 

comes to mop the tiled edge— 
his whole morning’s work   
fragmented by our wall of leaves. 
No arm in a rolled sleeve, 

bending, lifting. No flashing sections 
of aluminum pole fit into a blue mesh scoop   
for whisking up floating petals. 
No closeup: like a Cubist inset, 

a turbanned man sipping tea,   
eyebrow and striped cup,   
slice of a woman’s profile   
black half-veil, two eyes 

yoked in kohl moving in a hand-held   
mirror. No sun machine-gunning   
that round of glass. No part 
of a lamb turning on part of a spit. 

No peacock opening a bit   
of its promiscuous fan. 
No cook hurrying the meat 
with jagged curses. No meat.   
No god. No medallion front,   
officially defaced, 
               the cornices deflagged   
as bare crude evidence 
or our power to invade, 
theirs to resist. 

A For Sale sign likens it   
to a house on a cloud,   
a sunrise mosque. It has   
patterned tiles with sickles 

of wheat or hashish. And wickets,   
a porte cochère engemmed 
with rotating spots. 
Maybe a neighbor, through 

a closing door, 
saw grown men cry out 
in a frenzy, on a cold floor, 
to a god no one comprehends. 

No one comprehends how, 
like the god of the broken, rusted lamp,   
once out, uncramped, 
                              he’s not. 

Not anything you could imagine   
not any servant 
but the familiar reductive infinite— 
lines of fuel drums, phone wires. 
Rolled up in the bottom of a child’s red valise, 

timing devices, threads of plastique . . . 
left behind for the doubters, 
the personal grit of some other deity,   
some intoxicating tattooed Allah 

above the human ruins, head in hand.   
Not that. Not this. In the garden, 
a broken rope of amber beads, 
within each separate bead 
the lights of patrols go by, 
elongate—the next night and the next— 

                           what I don’t know   
                           but learn to dread 
                           turns over slowly in my bed.

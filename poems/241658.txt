title : last swan of avon

author : Julian Talamantez Brolaski

socalled swan of avon
 n/t but a beaurocrat
 buggering the buttercups
 goy from the waist up
  
 now soldiers’re the ones making offers
 and fucking caravaggio posters
 maybe the artist had bothered about melancholia
  
 suddenly xe finds xemself walking down
 some dark corridor
  
 california was truly the promised land
 for a minute there
 video marlboro
 to show us
  
 shoppingcart in dingy water
 and then turn melancholical
  
 sign reads no squatting
 switchd on the cathode ray
 at yr coronation
  
 the bomb droppd w/ regular monotony
 leaving us wanting
  
          a to zed
 dampened a grid
  
 satyrical deliria
 pan’s baallet
 in a black tutu
  
 who have the inclination
 but even whose    necromancer—
 firelit but dred—
 —commandeering meadows—
 protests were pathetic

title : Beirut Tank

Staring up into the tank's belly lit 
by a bare bulb hanging down off 
the exhaust, a mechanic's hands are up 
inside the dark metallic innards doing something 
that looks personal, private. This tank is nothing 
like the ones the Americans deploy. 
Those have uranium piercing shells that could melt 
right through this tank's armor and set off 
the ammo box: nothing can withstand the American tanks.   

The barrel's called a cannon. The machine guns they call 
deterrents. The tank is old, small, about the size 
of a horse and cart. The armor plate shines green 
under the streetlight. The sprockets, almost rusted out.   
Somebody forgot to grease the nipples. The timing belt is nicked 
and worn. The spare parts from France don't fit. This wire   
crossed with this wire makes a catastrophic fire. 
Be careful how you route it. .20 caliber ammo 
goes in the hatch behind the armor plate.   

The mechanic on his back in the dirt, 
cursing in Arabic, sounds like he's cursing 
in a good-natured way: who was the fucking moron 
who did the maintenance on this thing?   
This tank, this tank, he should push it off 
a cliff into the sea so that it could bob for 
half an hour before sinking under the Pigeon Rocks 
where all the lovers gather in the shadows 
near that little bar, lit by a generator, that serves arak   

and warm beer to soldiers hanging out on the Corniche: 
mainly conscripts from down south, whose orange groves 
rot because nobody can pick the oranges: try to pick 
an orange and a cluster bomb lodged in leaves 
comes tumbling into your basket. What weight oil 
did this cocksucker use, anyway? And this engine, 
it's gonna blow. Beat up tanks and sandbags, 
that's all this army is, old sparkplugs that get fouled 
so that you have to file the gaps over and over. 

He stares up in that live, minute, completely   
concentrated way of scrutinizing something   
or someone you thought you understood: 
the tank's underbody completely covers his body 
so they look like they're embracing when he reaches up 
inside it, his needle nose pliers crimping, twisting,   
pulling down hard. There, you see that, it's all corroded. 
The cannon jutting out looks both threatening   
and vulnerable as if the tank's firepower 

were dependent on that wire. He runs two fingers 
up and down it, then feels where rust, 
mixed into an oily paste, shines like bloody flux 
that he gently dips his finger in, sniffs and tastes. 
Clanging back his tapping on the armor plate,   
as he listens to her talking on his back in the dirt, screwing in   
the spare parts, the tank says what tanks always say,   
Fix me, oil me, grease me, make it fit, 
confirming what he knows about the French.

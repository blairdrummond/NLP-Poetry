title : Night Song of the Los Angeles Basin

                                   Owl
                         calls, 
                         pollen dust blows
                Swirl of light strokes writhing
                knot-tying light paths,
  
                calligraphy of cars.
  
 Los Angeles basin and hill slopes
 Checkered with streetways. Floral loops
 Of the freeway express and exchange.
  
                   Dragons of light in the dark
                   sweep going both ways
                   in the night city belly.
                   The passage of light end to end and rebound,
                   —ride drivers all heading somewhere—
                   etch in their traces to night’s eye-mind
  
                   calligraphy of cars.
  
 Vole paths. Mouse trails worn in
 On meadow grass;
 Winding pocket-gopher tunnels,
 Marmot lookout rocks.
 Houses with green watered gardens
 Slip under the ghost of the dry chaparral,
  
                   Ghost
                   shrine to the L. A. River
                   The jinja that never was there
                   is there.
                   Where the river debouches
                   the place of the moment
                   of trembling and gathering and giving
                   so that lizards clap hands there
                   —just lizards
                   come pray, saying
                   “please give us health and long life.”
  
                             A hawk,
                             a mouse.
  
 Slash of calligraphy of freeways of cars.
  
                   Into the pools of the channelized river
                   the Goddess in tall rain dress
                   tosses a handful of meal.
  
                   Gold bellies roil
                   mouth-bubbles, frenzy of feeding,
                   the common ones, the bright-colored rare ones
                   show up, they tangle and tumble,
                   godlings ride by in Rolls Royce
                   wide-eyed in brokers’ halls
                   lifted in hotels
                   being presented to, platters
                   of tidbit and wine,
                   snatch of fame,
  
                            churn and roil,
  
                   meal gone   the water subsides.
  
                            A mouse,
                            a hawk.
  
 The calligraphy of lights on the night
                    freeways of Los Angeles
  
                    will long be remembered.
  
                            Owl
                    calls;
                             late-rising moon.

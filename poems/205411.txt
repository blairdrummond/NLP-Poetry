title : Like Rousseau

author : Amiri Baraka

text : 
She stands beside me, stands away,   
the vague indifference 
of her dreams. Dreaming, to go on,   
and go on there, like animals fleeing   
the rise of the earth. But standing   
intangible, my lust a worked anger 
a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul. 

Then back off, and where you go? Box of words   
and pictures. Steel balloons tied to our mouths.   
The room fills up, and the house. Street tilts.   
City slides, and buildings slide into the river.   
What is there left, to destroy? That is not close,   
or closer. Leaning away in the angle of language.   
Pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross 
and flash. It is the lovers pulling down empty structures.   
They wait and touch and watch their dreams   
eat the morning.

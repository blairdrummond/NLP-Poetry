title : Eight Presidents

text : 
October five. Seven years older in dog years and then your November
 the day record snowfalls hit Randolph New Hampshire in forty-three
 and I am thinking of something intimate and impossible to waste:
 Brazil’s undiscovered caverns of amethyst     endless smooth oval stones
 along Washington’s moody Pacific chewing a continent. But I am wrong.
 We pass St. Michael’s the cemetery that asks the public to mow and weed it
 and perhaps draw larger conclusions about the already wasted and tidy up names
 frayed at the edges by the ions that bind     by age the chemical salt of time
 that jostles stones over at their bases to remind us or alter their sentiments.
 We read and read and each time nothing new has come up on their markers.
 At home we hear the fishermen bring up their nets smack water to scare them.
 By now the flounder’s secret pocket where its heart and everything separate
 from meat and bone is cleaned and empty as a silk purse not a nickel left
 down in the freezer. Nothing really shines but this: I have loved you
 eight presidents. Forty years. Five point seven in dog.

title : To a Child in Heaven

author : Richard Emil Braun

text : 
You perished, in a toyland, of surprise;   
and only I am here to bury you 
in dessicated tulip tips and eyes 
of broken diadie-dolls. Poor pink, poor blue! 

Will you be grown when I’m in Heaven too?   
Will length of death have turned you Classical   
like old Bisque faces, keen and sainted view,   
pearl on your breast, pearl-pointed linen shawl? 

No, you’ll still have your flowers with no stem,   
and harp, clear stringed, the blur of La Boheme.   
You’ll heap upon that Mansion’s mantlepiece   
impossible plush animal creations, 
and pout the pillared City’s aberrations. 
You rest a Classic, but of Wedgewood’s Greece.

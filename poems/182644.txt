title : I look at the world

author : Langston Hughes

text : 
I look at the world 
From awakening eyes in a black face— 
And this is what I see: 
This fenced-off narrow space   
Assigned to me. 

I look then at the silly walls 
Through dark eyes in a dark face— 
And this is what I know: 
That all these walls oppression builds 
Will have to go! 

I look at my own body   
With eyes no longer blind— 
And I see that my own hands can make 
The world that's in my mind. 
Then let us hurry, comrades, 
The road to find.

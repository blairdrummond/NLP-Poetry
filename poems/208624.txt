title : Animal Caution

author : Chase Twichell

text : 
Whenever I touch the cairn 
marking the summit 
of one of my parents, 
touch the top stone, 
an animal caution comes over me, 
sinew and muscle like the brookâ€™s, 
a sudden shivering 
green-brown flame. 
Soon they will be constellations, 
and I a small tower of stones.

title : Consecration

text : 
The man in the yellow hard hat,   
the one with the mask   
across his nose and mouth, 

pulls the lever that turns 
the great arm of the crane up   
and over and sideways 

toward the earth; 
then the wrecking ball   
dangles crazily, 

so delicately, like a silver fob   
loosened from a waistcoat pocket:   
shocking to see 

the dust fly up and the timber   
sail up, then so slowly   
down, how the summer air 

bristles with a hundred splinters 
and the smallest is a splintered flame,   
for it takes so many lengthening 

erratic movements to tear away   
what stands between the sidewalk   
and the bell tower, 

where the pigeons now rise   
in grand indignant waves   
at such poor timing, such 

a deaf ear toward the music;   
in this way the silence 

between hand and lever is turned   
into a ragged and sorely lifted   
wing: the wrecking ball lurches   
in a narrowing arc until only 

the dust resists—the rest   
comes down, story by story, 
and is hauled off in flatbed trucks. 

Meanwhile the pedestrians come   
and go, now and then glancing   
at their accurate watches. 

Gradually, the dust   
becomes the rose light   
of autumn. 

But one evening a woman   
loses her way as she’s   
swept into a passing wave 

of commuters and she 
looks up toward the perfectly   
empty rectangle 

now hanging between 
the rutted mud and the sky.   
There along the sides 

of the adjacent building,   
like a set for a simple   
elementary school play, 

like the gestures of the dead   
in her children’s faces,   
she sees the flowered paper 

of her parents’ bedroom,   
the pink stripes leading   
up the stairs to the attic, 

and the outline of the claw- 
footed bathtub, font 
of the lost cathedral of childhood.

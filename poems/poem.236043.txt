Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! 
O what a foretaste of glory divine! 
Heir of salvation, purchase of God, 
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood! 

Chorus: 
   This is my story, this is my song, 
   Praising my Saviour all the day long. 

Perfect submission, perfect delight, 
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight; 
Angels descending bring from above 
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. 

Perfect submission, all is at rest, 
I in my Saviour am happy and blest,--   
Watching and waiting, looking above, 
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

Sonnet, Simile

Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,-- 
   The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: 
   Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms 
'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. 
All round our nest, far as the eye can pass, 
   Are golden kingcup fields with silver edge 
   Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge. 
'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass. 

Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fiy 
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:-- 
   So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above. 
Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, 
This close-companioned inarticulate hour 
   When twofold silence was the song of love.

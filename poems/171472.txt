title : Her Life Runs Like a Red Silk Flag

text : 
Because this evening Miss Hoang Yen 
sat down with me in the small 
tiled room of her family house 
I am unable to sleep. 
We shared a glass of cold and sweet water.   
On a blue plate her mother brought us 
cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me   
but I did not feel strange in the house 
my country had tried to bomb into dust.   
In English thick and dazed as blood 
she told me how she watched our planes   
cross her childhood’s sky, 
all the children of Hanoi 
carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, Nixon’s   
Christmas bombing. She let me hold her hand,   
her shy unmoving fingers, and told me 
how afraid she was those days and how this fear   
had dug inside her like a worm and lives   
inside her still, won’t die or go away. 
And because she’s stronger, she comforted me,   
said I’m not to blame, 
the million sorrows alive in her gaze. 
With the dead we share no common rooms. 
With the frightened we can’t think straight;   
no words can bring the burning city back.   
Outside on Hung Dao Street 
I tried to say good-bye and held her hand   
too long so she looked back through traffic   
towards her house and with her eyes   
she told me I should leave. 
All night I ached for her and for myself   
and nothing I could think or pray 
would make it stop. Some birds sang morning   
home across the lake. In small reed boats   
the lotus gatherers sailed out 
among their resuming white blossoms.

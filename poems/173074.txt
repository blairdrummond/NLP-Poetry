title : Ye Flowery Banks (Bonie Doon)

author : Robert Burns

text : 
Ye flowery banks o' bonie Doon, 
         How can ye blume sae fair? 
How can ye chant, ye little birds, 
         And I sae fu' o' care? 

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, 
         That sings upon the bough; 
Thou minds me o' the happy days, 
         When my fause love was true. 

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, 
         That sings beside thy mate; 
For sae I sat, and sae I sang, 
         And wist na o' my fate. 

Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon 
         To see the wood-bine twine, 
And ilka bird sang o' its luve, 
         And sae did I o' mine. 

Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose 
         Frae aff its thorny tree; 
And my fause luver staw my rose 
         But left the thorn wi' me.

title : Money Is Also a Kind of Music

The Wrecking Crew was just the cream of the "you pay — we'll play" LA session pool, that crack squad of 50 or 60 musicians...who played on Pet Sounds and Smile and probably half the records in your collection. They didn't just play the chops. They invented them. — Rob Chapman, MOJO
Money is also a kind of music. 
I don't mean the slight sleigh bell 
of a pocketed change purse 
or an old-time till's single tap 
of triangle, ringing 
up sale, or even the percussion 
of post-pillage coffers filling 
up, plink by plink. I think 
I mean that current 
of classically trained breath 
certain amounts of currency 
can call forth 
and blow through brass. 
I mean the mean 
current of electricity 
Carol Kaye's bass drew 
from Capitol Records in the sixties, 
the timesheets that took their toll 
and exchanged it for 
four / four time 
kept without fail by the brain 
of drummer Hal Blaine, 
worth its weight in scale.

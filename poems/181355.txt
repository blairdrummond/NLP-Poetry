Forty degrees; the threat of rain. That time of fall 
         When we are most inclined to end it all. 
Denim-jacketed, with a faded sweatshirt hood, 
         He draws his plane along a length of wood, 
         Then takes a chisel to a cornice piece 
         With two light taps. His movements never cease; 
His cracked and callused hands, in gloves with fingers cut, 
Rub up for warmth, then start like hares hawked by his thought. 

He knows no other work; wants none. He learned this from 
         His father—brace and auger, bob and plumb— 
The same way he learned how to hunt or take a beating: 
         Not by words but by a look, and by repeating 
         Mutely each grimace, wince, set of the jaw. 
         His job is more than workmanlike. No flaw 
Or gap offends the eye. Each post and bull-nose stair 
Seems proof of love—if love is proved by excess care.

title : Siren Song

author : Margaret Atwood

text : 
This is the one song everyone 
would like to learn: the song 
that is irresistible:

the song that forces men
to leap overboard in squadrons
even though they see the beached skulls

the song nobody knows
because anyone who has heard it
is dead, and the others can't remember.

Shall I tell you the secret 
and if I do, will you get me 
out of this bird suit?

I don't enjoy it here 
squatting on this island
looking picturesque and mythical

with these two feathery maniacs, 
I don't enjoy singing 
this trio, fatal and valuable.

I will tell the secret to you, 
to you, only to you. 
Come closer. This song

is a cry for help: Help me! 
Only you, only you can, 
you are unique

at last. Alas
it is a boring song
but it works every time.

title : One’s Ship Comes In

author : Joe Paddock

text : 
I swear 
my way now will be 
to continue without 
plan or hope, to accept 
the drift of things, to shift 
from endless effort 
to joy in, say, 
that robin, plunging 
into the mossy shallows 
of my bird bath and 
splashing madly till 
the air shines with spray. 
Joy it will be, say, 
in Nancy, pretty in pink 
and rumpled T-shirt, 
rubbing sleep from her eyes, or 
joy even in 
just this breathing, free 
of fright and clutch, knowing 
how one’s ship comes in 
with each such breath.

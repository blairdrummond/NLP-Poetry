You died. And because you were Greek they gave you   
          a coin to carry under your tongue and then also   
biscuits and honey. When you came to the riverbank 
          you saw a crazy-looking black bumboat on the water   
with a figure standing in it, lanky and dressed 
          darkly, holding a sweep. You were taken across, 
and you gave your coin for the passage, and continued 
          until you came to a three-headed dog, who snarled   
and threatened you, even though you were not trying 
          to escape. You gave him the biscuits smeared   
with honey, and you passed onward to the field 
          of asphodel and through the gate of Tartarus. Or 

you died and you were Navajo. They had carried you 
          out of the hogan earlier so you’d die in the sunshine.   
Or if it happened inside suddenly, they stuffed up 
          the smokehole and boarded the front entrance, and cut   
an opening in the back, the north-facing, dark-facing 
          side, to carry you out, and no one ever used   
that hogan again. They took off your moccasins 
          and put them on again wrong side to, the left one   
on the right foot, the right on the left, so that your 
          chindi would be confused and unable to return   
along your tracks. They washed your hair in suds 
          made from the yucca. Then they gave you   
enough fried bread and water to last four days, 
          and you set off on your journey. But actually 

none of these things happened. You just died.

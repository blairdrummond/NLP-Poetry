title : The Inevitable

author : Allan Peterson

text : 
To have that letter arrive   
was like the mist that took a meadow   
and revealed hundreds   
of small webs once invisible   
The inevitable often   
stands by plainly but unnoticed   
till it hands you a letter   
that says death and you notice   
the weed field had been   
readying its many damp handkerchiefs   
all along

text : 
Yea, gold is son of Zeus: no rust 
    Its timeless light can stain; 
The worm that brings man's flesh to dust 
    Assaults its strength in vain: 
More gold than gold the love I sing,
A hard, inviolable thing.

Men say the passions should grow old 
     With waning years; my heart 
Is incorruptible as gold, 
     'Tis my immortal part: 
Nor is there any god can lay
On love the finger of decay.

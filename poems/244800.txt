title : A Small Anatomy of Feeling

author : Anna Rabinowitz

text : 
That which installs itself in the mind embraces sound
  
 Rebounding,
                          rounding the fecund earth
  
 Birth, as in what is not, as in one makes one,
                                                      is a mighty absence to understand
  
 (and there are those who fail to get their lessons done)
  
 Dun is the color of submission
  
 Unfledged, she leafs through what has been nothing never
 Never to be what she is/ or could /or hope to be
 Bewitched by dictions (fictions) on the surface—
  
 Face naming that which she must save, polished like an apple—
  
 Apple of the eye, amour of town and street, apple of the cheek
 Eaten with a dab of honey for a sweet year
  
 Ear to who am I in the suddenly-arriving what-comes-next
 Next to being, next to delivery, next to undergone
 Gone parenthetical but now revived as her eye
 Spies the sudden trespass of his unexpected welcome—
  
 Succumbing, coming unto him in full sun this morning
  
 Mourning what she need not beguile or lie beside

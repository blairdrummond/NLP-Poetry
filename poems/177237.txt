title : A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard’s Shack

author : James Wright

text : 
Near the dry river’s water-mark we found   
      Your brother Minnegan, 
Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.   
Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,   
Told me to find you, even in the rain, 
      And tell you he was drowned. 

I hid behind the chassis on the bank,   
      The wreck of someone’s Ford: 
I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:   
You told me once the waking up was hard,   
The daylight beating at you like a board. 
      Blood in my stomach sank. 

Beside, you told him never to go out 
      Along the river-side 
Drinking and singing, clattering about. 
You might have thrown a rock at me and cried   
I was to blame, I let him fall in the road   
      And pitch down on his side. 

Well, I’ll get hell enough when I get home   
      For coming up this far, 
Leaving the note, and running as I came.   
I’ll go and tell my father where you are.   
You’d better go find Minnegan before 
      Policemen hear and come. 

Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,   
      You old son of a bitch. 
You better hurry down to Minnegan; 
He’s drunk or dying now, I don’t know which,   
Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,   
      The poor old man.

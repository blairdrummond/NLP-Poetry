I Amidah 

Hear my personal prayer, the words of my mouth and the meditation 
of my heart that I may find a way back through love 
In the hospital room   packed in blood-soaked cotton   the new mother lay 
animal-exhausted   technicians whisked the child away   in the first 
hours there was fear O teach me to withhold judgment 

of the one who took my place who said yes when I said no 
whose days opened to the child when my days foreclosed 
she who conceived of joy where I imagined the crossbar 
against my chest   subjugation of family life   the double 
harness   the never ending tasks   the clamp and vise 


II Shofar 

The shofar blasts birthday of the world of our dominion 
over nature in the Kingdom of the Lord our God Ruler 
of the Universe   Then why am I weeping into this tissue? 
What is this child to me who refused to stay and raise him? 
What is the broken covenant, this yoke? 


III Tashlikh 

By a small stream as is customary 
we cast into the water with its drift 
of leaves our quarrels like stones our envies 
and resentments  O Lord   You do not maintain anger 
but delight in forgiveness 


IV Aleinu 

You take me down to the nursery to see 
Joseph in his little cap of many colors 
with hi jaundice and his brisk efficient keepers 
Will you be kind? Cleanse my mind of wickedness 
Teach me to attain a heart of wisdom 

In the synagogue the families praise all fruitbearing trees 
and cedars   all wild beasts and cattle   I watch a woman 
and her teenage daughter confer   lean into each other 
They hold the mahzor between them   their mouths shape the beautiful 
Hebrew I do not know how to read except in transliteration 


V Teshuvah 

Turn from evil and do good   the Psalmist says   turning 
Round the turn   turn the key   clock the turn   turn in time 
time to turn words into footsteps   to lead the young colt to the field 
to turn from the old year   the old self   You are ready 
to turn and be healed   only face   only begin 


VI Amidah 

Inscribe him in the Book of Life for Your sake   living God 
She opened up the book of her body again and again 
She would not stop trying though I mocked her   a year 
ended and a year began   I had no imagination for family life 
inhabiting sadly that place for years 

inhabiting sadly that place for years   with me   who chose 
to keep my faith with those who sleep in dust   she chose 
against the quiet house and noiseless rooms she chose 
to bear her mortal woman’s hare and split her life in two 
or three or four   she said I know what you want   I want more 


VII Avinu malkeinu 

Avinu malkeinu inscribe us in the Book of Deliverance 
Avinu malkeinu inscribe us in the Book of Merit 
Avinu malkeinu inscribe us in the Book of Forgiveness 
Sarah beseeched God for a child and brought forth Isaac 
And Sally brought forth Joseph   Amen 

A voice commands the lightning that cleaves stones 
A voice shatters stately cedars 
A voice twists the trees and strips the forest bare 
The devout say In your love for your neighbor will you find God 
They say Days are scrolls   Write only what you want remembered 


VIII Kedushah 

We believe that God abides in mystery   in a diaspora of dust 
in the obsessive   the compulsive   the disordered   in the lonely 
in the bosses   in the unendurable   in the technological 
and pharmaceutical failures   in the very old 
in the newborn   in memory   in kindness   in acts of lovingkindness 

We believe that God abides in the unfit   in those unshielded 
by luck or faith and by bad luck made abject by the unctuous 
I believe in the uncomputerized and the demoralized 
the belittled and benumbed gazing like dumb beasts 
like my sister groping mid-seizure back to speech 

IX Mourner’s Kaddish 

Bless my sister who could not endure   bless her failure to thrive 
and bless my parents in their magnificent witness 
Sanctify this Day of Remembrance   Grant them peace 
from the clichéd language of condolence cards   Be merciful to those 
who passed Your blessed days in a curtained room of shame 

In the public place   in the hall outfitted with a simple ark 
the mourners stand   Whom shall I dread? we ask with our private 
dreads on our civic faces   We are an assembly of stunned 
children called to recite Yit-gadal ve-yit kadash shmei raba 
There is always someone to mourn   Look around 


X The Fast of Yom Kippur 

Look around   the congregation atones   we certify regret 
we recall our transgressions   and those who transgressed against us 
Where is my milk?   Joseph cries and she feeds him   The Torah 
teaches repentance   I remember my zayde, a shrunken man 
at the front of the shul fasting   By the last Aleinu he could not stand 

My father brought smelling salts   the son who did no know 
the prayers sat with his father   His life was one long prayer 
in the hereness of God    On the maternity floor food and flowers 
Choose life! shouts baby Joseph tightly bound in a cotton blanket 
I’m afraid it’s time to go says the kind nurse after visiting hours 


XI Selihot 

The days of women and men are as grass. 
They flourish as flowers in the field. 
The wind passes over them and is gone, 
and no one can recognize where they grew. 


XII Amidah 

Inscribe for me a childless life   O lift me 
to the Book of Many Forms that I might find another way 
to honor my father and mother   their agony of bereavement 
Let me understand the girl child I was   beloved as Joseph in his coat 
of many colors, favored by his father   hated by his brothers 

and by his brothers thrown into the pit   Then to live among strangers 
in Egypt far from family   Bind me to these friends and to this child 
that I may learn my true relation to the people of this story 
Sanctify difference and refusal   bless 
the lesbians   the child with two mothers   Amen

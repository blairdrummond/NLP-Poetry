Sonnet

A vision as of crowded city streets, 
      With human life in endless overflow; 
      Thunder of thoroughfares; trumpets that blow 
      To battle; clamor, in obscure retreats, 
Of sailors landed from their anchored fleets; 
      Tolling of bells in turrets, and below 
      Voices of children, and bright flowers that throw 
      O'er garden-walls their intermingled sweets! 
This vision comes to me when I unfold 
      The volume of the Poet paramount, 
      Whom all the Muses loved, not one alone; -- 
Into his hands they put the lyre of gold, 
      And, crowned with sacred laurel at their fount, 
      Placed him as Musagetes on their throne.

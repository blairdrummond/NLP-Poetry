When the snake bit   
Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa   
while he was praying 

the snake died. (Each day   
is attended by surprises   
or it is nothing.) 

Question: was the bare-footed,   
smelly Rabbi more poisonous   
than the snake 

or so God-adulterated   
he’d become immune   
to serpent poison? 

Oh great-great-great-uncles,   
your palms weighing air,   
why are you arguing? 

Listen, the snake thought   
(being old and unwell   
and bad-tempered as hell) 

Death, where’s thy sting?   
In short, was just testing:   
a snake’s last fling. 

Yes, the so-called snake 
was dying anyway, its heart   
calcified and as old as Eden. 

No, that snake was A1 fit   
but while hissing for fun it   
clumsily bit its own tongue. 

No, Hanina invented that snake;   
not for his own sake but for first- 
class, religious publicity. 

No no, here’s the key to it.   
Ask: did the Rabbi, later on,   
become a jumpy, timid man? 

Remember, he who has been bitten   
by a snake thereafter becomes   
frightened of a rope … 

Bearded men in darkening rooms   
sipping lemon tea and arguing   
about the serpent till the moon 

of Russia, of Latvia, Lithuania,   
Poland, rose above the alien   
steeples—centuries of sleep. 

Now, tonight, a clean-shaven rabbi   
who once studied in Vienna   
says snake-venom contains 

haemolysins, haemo- 
coagulants, protolysins,   
cytolysins and neurotoxins 

and that even in Hanina 
ben Dosa’s day a snake was a   
snake—unless, of course, it was 

a penis, an unruly penis,   
making a noise like one pissing   
on a mound of fresh hot ashes. 

Oh great-great-great-uncles 
did you hear him? And are your   
handbones weighing moonshine?

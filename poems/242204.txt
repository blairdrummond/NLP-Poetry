title : Intelligence﻿

author : Tom Sleigh

text : 
Wiretaps and tapes, concealed
 bugs and mikes,
                            intercepted letters
 full of passionate declarations, contradictory
 intelligence—
                            how attached he’d grown
 to the subject’s documents, revising and rearranging
 the influx of intelligence
 with a sentiment, he acknowledged, almost
                            like love: he felt
 the cool gray eyes of his superiors
 trained on him, rebuking him
                            for swerving, for letting
 himself go—such tender obsession
 occasioned by the file!
                            Not quite the professional style
 he or the Agency expected…
  
 But such official loyalties
                            seemed mere protocol to this!—
 what was wrong with him,
                            he wondered, that he construed
 the documents to make the subject
 seem a hero,
                            a bastard whose sole patrimony
 was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword
 left by an unknown father beneath a stone?
  
 And yet his exploits in the tabloids,
 the headlines screaming,
  
 SCOURGE OF MONSTERS STRIKES AGAIN!
 HERO FOUNDS REPUBLIC
  
                            were these heroic
 different in kind from the rumors,
 unverified,
                            of a rape, a murder?
  
 —But to have met undisguised the devouring monster!
 To have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze…
  
 On balance, for such a life,
                            the hero’s reputation wasn’t bad:
 think of the opportunities for evil
                            a man of such qualities must have had!
 How well he knew him—an essential innocence
 that followed impulse, blind
 to protocol, not noticeably more kind
                            than he was cruel.
 But to stamp Case Closed and cease
                            gathering intelligence,
 to give the hero up, almost, he admitted,
 like a lover…:
                            such limits the hero
 unknowingly transgressed!
 And the Agency, cold-blooded where
                            limits were concerned (“mere protocol”?—
 more like a second backbone!), committed
                            to keeping order, could not afford
 such sentiments—the Chief of Security
 felt an awful pang: that the work of intelligence
                            should lead to this…
  
 He leaned back in his chair and sighed:
                            a forged genealogy certifying
 that the hero’s father was a king; a mutual
 assistance pact
                            to aid in taking back the usurped crown:
 he could see them now, the wind
 blowing lightly, the two of them sweating
 as they climbed the cliff, discussing
                            the terms, exchanging information,
 intelligence—
                            how would his own face look
 staring down across the sea
                            as he gestured earnestly toward
 some island, saying,
                            “According to our sources,
 the tax revenues…”
                            And then, edging
 the hero closer to the cliff, pointing
                            out the harbor, he’d push.

title : And the Ship Sails On

author : Joel Brouwer

text : 
He faced the sink, one foot up
 on the edge of the tub. She stood
 behind him, reaching around.
 In the mirror, her face rose
 over his shoulder like the moon,
 and like the moon she regarded him
 beautifully but without feeling,
 and he looked at her as he would
 at the moon: How beautiful!
 How distant! No smiling, no weeping,
 no talking. A man and a woman
 transacting their magnificent business
 with the usual equanimity. The man
 as a passenger walking the ship’s deck
 at evening and the woman as the moon
 over his shoulder oiling the ocean
 with light. Deep in the ship’s belly
 pistons churned and sailors fed
 the boilers' roar with coal. On deck
 just the engine’s dull thrum and 
 a faint click as the woman sets her ring
 on the cool white lip of the sink.

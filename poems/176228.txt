title : Against Travel

author : Charles Tomlinson

text : 
These days are best when one goes nowhere, 
The house a reservoir of quiet change, 
The creak of furniture, the window panes 
Brushed by the half-rhymes of activities 
That do not quite declare what thing it was 
Gave rise to them outside. The colours, even, 
Accord with the tenor of the dayyes, ‘grey’ 
You will hear reported of the weather, 
But what a grey, in which the tinges hover, 
About to catch, although they still hold back 
The blaze that's in them should the sun appear, 
And yet it does not. Then the window pane 
With a tremor of glass acknowledges
The distant boom of a departing plane.

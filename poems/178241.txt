title : Solo R&B Vocal Underground

author : W. S. Di Piero

text : 
It seems to head from its last stop too fast, 
my transbay train’s strungout hoo, deep 
inside the tunnel, and starts to bleed 
into the baritone wail of that guy 
at platform’s end, a sort of lullaby 
rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall 
of wind darkening toward us, his whippy voice 
skinning its tired song off the tiled dome: 
he’s determined, the silky lyric says, 
to be independently blue, while we all 
wait to be chuted to car lot or home, 
closer to love, or farther, and sooner to loss, 
our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed, 
every plural presence now some thing alone, 
thanks to our singer-man. We wait for the train, 
patient with hope, a hope that’s like complaint.

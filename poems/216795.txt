title : Lullabye for the Second Millennium

author : J. Allyn Rosser

text : 
From the point of view of all time, 
these recent changes signal 
more a return to nature 
than a departure, than degradation. 
In the beginning, after all, 
there was boiling rock. 
Then waters arranging their bodies 
around an era of softer forms: 
lichen, grassland, swaying treetops. 
Then creatures, movingly fleshed, 
treading pathways that hardened. 
Then pavement hardening 
and cities, monumental. 
Soon mostly rock again, 
and radiant. More and more like moon. 
Soon, sooner than is being thought, 
there will be even more light. 
The creatures will have stopped 
being able to move 
or be moved. 
And the rock will boil.

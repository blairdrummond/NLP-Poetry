title : Knucks

author : Carl Sandburg

text : 
In Abraham Lincoln’s city, 
Where they remember his lawyer’s shingle, 
The place where they brought him 
Wrapped in battle flags, 
Wrapped in the smoke of memories 
From Tallahassee to the Yukon, 
The place now where the shaft of his tomb 
Points white against the blue prairie dome, 
In Abraham Lincoln’s city ... I saw knucks 
In the window of Mister Fischman’s second-hand store 
On Second Street. 

I went in and asked, “How much?” 
“Thirty cents apiece,” answered Mister Fischman. 
And taking a box of new ones off a shelf 
He filled anew the box in the showcase 
And said incidentally, most casually 
And incidentally: 
“I sell a carload a month of these.” 

I slipped my fingers into a set of knucks, 
Cast-iron knucks molded in a foundry pattern, 
And there came to me a set of thoughts like these: 
Mister Fischman is for Abe and the “malice to none” stuff, 
And the street car strikers and the strike-breakers, 
And the sluggers, gunmen, detectives, policemen, 
Judges, utility heads, newspapers, priests, lawyers, 
They are all for Abe and the “malice to none” stuff. 

I started for the door. 
“Maybe you want a lighter pair,” 
Came Mister Fischman’s voice. 
I opened the door ... and the voice again: 
“You are a funny customer.” 

Wrapped in battle flags, 
Wrapped in the smoke of memories, 
This is the place they brought him, 
This is Abraham Lincoln's home town.

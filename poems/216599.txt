title : The Fabric of Life

It is very stretchy.   
We know that, even if   
many details remain   
sketchy. It is complexly   
woven. That much too   
has pretty well been   
proven. We are loath   
to continue our lessons   
which consist of slaps   
as sharp and dispersed   
as bee stings from   
a smashed nest   
when any strand snaps— 

hurts working far past   
the locus of rupture,   
attacking threads   
far beyond anything   
we would have said   
connects.

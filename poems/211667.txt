In the early stages of epilepsy there occurs a characteristic dream .... One is  somehow lifted free of one’s own body;  looking back one sees oneself and feels a  sudden, maddening fear; another presence is  entering one’s own person, and there is no  avenue of return. —George Steiner
Outside my window the wasps   
are making their slow circle,   
dizzy flights of forage and return,   
hovering among azaleas 
that bob in a sluggish breeze   
this humid, sun-torn morning. 

Yesterday my wife held me here 
as I thrashed and moaned, her hand   
in my foaming mouth, and my son   
saw what he was warned he might. 

Last night dreams stormed my brain   
in thick swirls of shame and fear. 
Behind a white garage a locked shed   
full of wide-eyed dolls burned, 
yellow smoke boiling up in huge clumps   
as I watched, feet nailed to the ground.   
In dining cars white table cloths 
unfolded wings and flew like gulls.   
An old German in a green Homburg   
sang lieder, Mein Herz ist müde. 
In a garden in Pasadena my father   
posed in Navy whites while overhead 
silver dirigibles moved like great whales.   
And in the narrowing tunnel   
of the dream’s end I flew down   
onto the iron red road 
of my grandfather’s farm. 
There was a white rail fence. 
In the green meadow beyond,   
a small boy walked toward me.   
His smile was the moon’s rim.   
Across his egg-shell eyes 
ran scenes from my future life,   
and he embraced me like a son   
or father or my lost brother.

text : 
Love the drill, confound the dentist.   
Love the fever that carries me home.   
Meat of exile. Salt of grief. 
This much, indifferent 

affliction might yield. But how   
when the table is God’s own board   
and grace must be said in company?   
If hatred were honey, as even 

the psalmist persuaded himself,   
then Agatha might be holding 
her breasts on the plate for reproach.   
The plate is decidedly 

ornamental, and who shall say that pity’s   
not, at this remove? Her gown 
would be stiff with embroidery whatever   
the shape of the body beneath. 

Perhaps in heaven God can’t hide   
his face. So the wounded 
are given these gowns to wear 
and duties that teach them the leverage 

of pain. Agatha listens with special   
regard to the barren, the dry, 
to those with tumors where milk   
should be, to those who nurse 

for hire. Let me swell, 
let me not swell. Remember the child,   
how its fingers go blind as it sucks.   
Bartholomew, flayed, intervenes 

for the tanners. Catherine for millers,   
whose wheels are of stone. Sebastian   
protects the arrowsmiths, and John   
the chandlers, because he was boiled 

in oil. We borrow our light 
where we can, here’s begging the pardon   
of tallow and wick. And if, as we’ve tried   
to extract from the prospect, we’ll each 

have a sign to be known by at last— 
a knife, a floursack, a hammer, a pot—   
the saints can stay, 
the earth won’t entirely have given us up.

Mid-sentence, we remembered the eclipse, 
Arguing home through our scant patch of park 
Still warm with barrel wine, when none too soon 
We checked the hour by glancing at the moon, 
Unphased at first by that old ruined marble 
Looming like a monument over the hill, 
So brimmed with light it seemed about to spill, 

Then, there! We watched the thin edge disappearâ€” 
The obvious stole over us like awe, 
That it was our own silhouette we saw, 
Slow perhaps to us moon-gazing here 
(Reaching for each other's fingertips) 
But sweeping like a wing across that stark 
Alien surface at the speed of dark. 

The crickets stirred from winter sleep to warble 
Something out of time, confused and brief, 
The roosting birds sang out in disbelief, 
The neighborhood's stray dogs began to bark. 
And then the moon was gone, and in its place, 
A dim red planet hung just out of reach, 
As real as a bitter orange or ripened peach 

In the penumbra of a tree. At last 
We rose and strolled at a reflective pace 
Past the taverna crammed with light and smoke 
And people drinking, laughing at a joke, 
Unaware that anything had passed 
Outside in the night where we delayed 
Sheltering in the shadow we had made.

My family’s very talented, 
I’m certain you’ll agree. 
We each possess a special skill 
that anyone can see. 

My brother’s good at burying 
his finger up his nose. 
My sister’s good at covering 
her room with dirty clothes. 

My father’s good at eating soup 
in big, disgusting slurps. 
My mother’s good at cutting loose 
with world-record burps. 

Our dog is good at piddling 
in the back seat of the car. 
The baby’s good at putting 
Pop-Tarts in the VCR. 

Myself I’m good at sleeping late 
and making lots of noise, 
and cluttering the living room 
with comic books and toys. 

So though we’re very talented, 
I’m sad to say it’s true: 
We’re only good at doing things 
we’re not supposed to do.

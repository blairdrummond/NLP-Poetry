title : Thine Own

author : Josephine Delphine Henderson Heard

text : 
To live and not be Thine Own,
Like Springtime is when birds are flown; 
Or liberty in prison bars, 
Or evening skies without the stars; 
Like diamonds that are lusterless, 
Or rest when there’s no weariness; 
Like lovely flower that have no scent, 
Or music when the sound is spent.

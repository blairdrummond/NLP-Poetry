Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days!   
Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways:   
Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide;   
The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed, 
Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold; 
And thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown old   
In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,   
Sing in their high and lonely melody.   
Come near, that no more blinded by man's fate, 
I find under the boughs of love and hate, 
In all poor foolish things that live a day,   
Eternal beauty wandering on her way. 

Come near, come near, come near--Ah, leave me still 
A little space for the rose-breath to fill! 
Lest I no more hear common things that crave;   
The weak worm hiding down in its small cave,   
The field-mouse running by me in the grass,   
And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass;   
But seek alone to hear the strange things said 
By God to the bright hearts of those long dead,   
And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.   
Come near; I would, before my time to go,   
Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:   
Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days.

title : The One I Think of Now

author : Wesley McNair

text : 
At the end of my stepfather’s life 
when his anger was gone, 
and the saplings of his failed 
nursery had grown into trees, 
my newly feminist mother had him 
in the kitchen to pay for all 
those years he only did the carving. 
“You know where that is,” 
she would say as he looked 
for a knife to cut the cheese 
and a tray to serve it with, 
his apron wide as a dress 
above his workboots, confused 
as a girl. He is the one I think of now, 
lifting the tray for my family, 
the guests, until at last he comes 
to me. And I, no less confused, 
look down from his hurt eyes as if 
there were nothing between us 
except an arrangement of cheese, 
and not this bafflement, these 
almost tender hands that once 
swung hammers and drove machines 
and insisted that I learn to be a man.

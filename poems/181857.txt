text : 
fools, who ate the cattle of Helios Hyperion;  but he deprived them of the day of their return.  — Odyssey 
Since we still had some hardtack 
how stupid of us 
to go ashore and eat 
the Sun’s slow cattle, 

for each was a castle 
you’d have to battle 
forty years, till you’d become 
a hero and a star! 

On the earth’s back we hungered, 
but when we’d eaten well 
we fell to these lower regions 
mindless and satisfied.

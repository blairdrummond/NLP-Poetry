It is the right time for hallucinations. 
Drowning in a sty, the sailor 
feels the ocean’s buoyancy. 
Dying in a web, the moth 
discards its wings and falls free. 

I wish something would put its hands on me, 
give me stronger poison and then stronger. 
The beautiful flotillas do not stop. 
Undying love drifts and delays. 
I am capsizing. 

Great joy lingers still. 
Nothing can be said for suffering. 
It is legible only to strangers 
and at great distances. It detests 
survivors. It drapes gun-carriages 

with flowers, lampposts with hanging boys. 
It is the right time for hallucinations, 
most nakedly of inmost west. 
Her death would be less tender now, 
dusted over with charity, 

a web of useless wings, a shallow sty. 
She gave me stronger poison and then stronger. 
I miss her. 
In the back seat of the taxi, 
dark breathlessness says “Hurry, hurry.”

text : 
I love him so, this creature I do pray 
was treated kindly. I will pay 
as much as pig-lovers see fit 

to guarantee him that. As for his fat,   
I’d give up years yes years of my   
own life for such 

a gulpable semblable.   
(My life! Such as it is! This 
liberality of leaves! The world 

won’t need those seventeen more 
poems, after all, there being 
so few subjects to be treated. Three 

if by subject we mean anyone 
submitted to another’s 
will. Two if by subject we mean   

topic. One if by death we wind up 
meaning love. And none if a subject   
must entail 

the curlicue’s indulgence of itself.)

text : 
Something has to give. 
We stand above it all. 
Below, the buildings' tall 
but tiny narrative. 

The water's always near, 
you say. And so are you, 
for now. It has to do. 
There's little left to fear. 

A wind so cold, one might 
forget that winter's gone. 
The city lights are on 
for us, to us, tonight.

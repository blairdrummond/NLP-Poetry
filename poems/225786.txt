title : A Brown Girl Dead

author : Countee Cullen

text : 
With two white roses on her breasts, 
   White candles at head and feet,   
Dark Madonna of the grave she rests; 
   Lord Death has found her sweet. 

Her mother pawned her wedding ring   
   To lay her out in white; 
She’d be so proud she’d dance and sing   
   To see herself tonight.

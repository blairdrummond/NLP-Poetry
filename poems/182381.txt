title : Ernesto Cardenal and I

author : Roberto Bolaño

text : 
I was out walking, sweaty and with hair plastered 
to my face 
when I saw Ernesto Cardenal approaching 
from the opposite direction 
and by way of greeting I said: 
Father, in the Kingdom of Heaven 
that is communism, 
is there a place for homosexuals? 
Yes, he said.   
And for impenitent masturbators? 
For sex slaves? 
For sex fools? 
For sadomasochists, for whores, for those obsessed   
with enemas,   
for those who can't take it anymore, those who really truly   
can't take it anymore? 
And Cardenal said yes.    
And I raised my eyes 
and the clouds looked like 
the pale pink smiles of cats 
and the trees cross-stitched on the hill 
(the hill we've got to climb) 
shook their branches.   
Savage trees, as if saying 
some day, sooner rather than later, you'll have to come 
into my rubbery arms, into my scraggly arms, 
into my cold arms. A botanical frigidity 
that'll stand your hair on end.

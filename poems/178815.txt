1. FAITH 

“I’ve been having these 
awful dreams, each a little different, 
though the core’s the same— 

we’re walking in a field, 
Wally and Arden and I, a stretch of grass 
with a highway running beside it, 

or a path in the woods that opens 
onto a road. Everything’s fine, 
then the dog sprints ahead of us, 

excited; we’re calling but 
he’s racing down a scent and doesn’t hear us, 
and that’s when he goes 

onto the highway. I don’t want to describe it. 
Sometimes it’s brutal and over, 
and others he’s struck and takes off 

so we don’t know where he is 
or how bad. This wakes me 
every night now, and I stay awake; 

I’m afraid if I sleep I’ll go back 
into the dream. It’s been six months, 
almost exactly, since the doctor wrote 

not even a real word 
but an acronym, a vacant 
four-letter cipher 

that draws meanings into itself, 
reconstitutes the world. 
We tried to say it was just 

a word; we tried to admit 
it had power and thus to nullify it 
by means of our acknowledgement. 

I know the current wisdom: 
bright hope, the power of wishing you’re well. 
He’s just so tired, though nothing 

shows in any tests, Nothing, 
the doctor says, detectable; 
the doctor doesn’t hear what I do, 

that trickling, steadily rising nothing 
that makes him sleep all day, 
vanish into fever’s tranced afternoons, 

and I swear sometimes 
when I put my head to his chest 
I can hear the virus humming 

like a refrigerator. 
Which is what makes me think 
you can take your positive attitude 

and go straight to hell. 
We don’t have a future, 
we have a dog. 
      Who is he? 

Soul without speech, 
sheer, tireless faith, 
he is that-which-goes-forward, 

black muzzle, black paws 
scouting what’s ahead; 
he is where we’ll be hit first, 

he’s the part of us 
that’s going to get it. 
I’m hardly awake on our morning walk 

—always just me and Arden now— 
and sometimes I am still 
in the thrall of the dream, 

which is why, when he took a step onto Commercial 
before I’d looked both ways, 
I screamed his name and grabbed his collar. 

And there I was on my knees, 
both arms around his neck 
and nothing coming, 

and when I looked into that bewildered face 
I realized I didn’t know what it was 
I was shouting at, 

I didn’t know who I was trying to protect.” 


       2. REPRIEVE 

I woke in the night 
and thought, It was a dream, 

nothing has torn the future apart, 
we have not lived years 

in dread, it never happened, 
I dreamed it all. And then 

there was this sensation of terrific pressure 
lifting, as if I were rising 

in one of those old diving bells, 
lightening, unburdening. I didn’t know 

how heavy my life had become—so much fear, 
so little knowledge. It was like 

being young again, but I understood 
how light I was, how without encumbrance,— 

and so I felt both young and awake, 
which I never felt 

when I was young. The curtains moved 
—it was still summer, all the windows open— 

and I thought, I can move that easily. 
I thought my dream had lasted for years, 

a decade, a dream can seem like that, 
I thought, There’s so much more time ... 

And then of course the truth 
came floating back to me. 

You know how children 
love to end stories they tell 

by saying, It was all a dream? Years ago, 
when I taught kids to write, 

I used to tell them this ending spoiled things, 
explaining and dismissing 

what had come before. Now I know 
how wise they were, to prefer 

that gesture of closure, 
their stories rounded not with a sleep 

but a waking. What other gift 
comes close to a reprieve? 

This was the dream that Wally told me: 
I was in the tunnel, he said, 

and there really was a light at the end, 
and a great being standing in the light.   

His arms were full of people, men and women, 
but his proportions were all just right—I mean 

he was the size of you or me. 
And the people said, Come with us, 

we’re going dancing. And they seemed so glad 
to be going, and so glad to have me   

join them, but I said, 
I’m not ready yet. I didn’t know what to do, 

when he finished, 
except hold the relentless 

weight of him, I didn’t know 
what to say except, It was a dream, 

nothing’s wrong now, 
it was only a dream. 


       3. MICHAEL’S DREAM 

Michael writes to tell me his dream: 
I was helping Randy out of bed, 
supporting him on one side 
with another friend on the other, 

and as we stood him up, he stepped out 
of the body I was holding and became 
a shining body, brilliant light   
held in the form I first knew him in. 

This is what I imagine will happen, 
the spirit’s release. Michael, 
when we support our friends, 
one of us on either side, our arms 

under the man or woman’s arms, 
what is it we’re holding? Vessel, 
shadow, hurrying light? All those years 
I made love to a man without thinking 

how little his body had to do with me; 
now, diminished, he’s never been so plainly 
himself—remote and unguarded, 
an otherness I can’t know 

the first thing about. I said, 
You need to drink more water   
or you’re going to turn into   
an old dry leaf. And he said, 

Maybe I want to be an old leaf. 
In the dream Randy’s leaping into 
the future, and still here; Michael’s holding him 
and releasing at once. Just as Steve’s 

holding Jerry, though he’s already gone, 
Marie holding John, gone, Maggie holding 
her John, gone, Carlos and Darren 
holding another Michael, gone, 

and I’m holding Wally, who’s going. 
Where isn’t the question, 
though we think it is; 
we don’t even know where the living are, 

in this raddled and unraveling “here.” 
What is the body? Rain on a window, 
a clear movement over whose gaze? 
Husk, leaf, little boat of paper 

and wood to mark the speed of the stream? 
Randy and Jerry, Michael and Wally 
and John: lucky we don’t have to know 
what something is in order to hold it. 


       4. ATLANTIS 

I thought your illness a kind of solvent 
dissolving the future a little at a time; 

I didn’t understand what’s to come 
was always just a glimmer 

up ahead, veiled like the marsh 
gone under its tidal sheet 

of mildly rippling aluminum. 
What these salt distances were 

is also where they’re going: 
from blankly silvered span 

toward specificity: the curve 
of certain brave islands of grass, 

temporary shoulder-wide rivers 
where herons ply their twin trades 

of study and desire. I’ve seen 
two white emissaries unfold 

like heaven’s linen, untouched, 
enormous, a fluid exhalation. Early spring, 

too cold yet for green, too early 
for the tumble and wrack of last season 

to be anything but promise, 
but there in the air was white tulip, 

marvel, triumph of all flowering, the soul 
lifted up, if we could still believe 

in the soul, after so much diminishment ... 
Breath, from the unpromising waters, 

up, across the pond and the two-lane highway, 
pure purpose, over the dune, 

gone. Tomorrow’s unreadable 
as this shining acreage; 

the future’s nothing 
but this moment’s gleaming rim. 

Now the tide’s begun 
its clockwork turn, pouring, 

in the day’s hourglass, 
toward the other side of the world, 

and our dependable marsh reappears 
—emptied of that starched and angular grace 

that spirited the ether, lessened, 
but here. And our ongoingness, 

what there’ll be of us? Look, 
love, the lost world 

rising from the waters again: 
our continent, where it always was, 

emerging from the half-light, unforgettable, 
drenched, unchanged. 


       5. COASTAL 

Cold April and the neighbor girl 
   —our plumber’s daughter— 
         comes up the wet street 

from the harbor carrying, 
    in a nest she’s made 
         of her pink parka, 

a loon. It’s so sick, 
    she says when I ask. 
         Foolish kid, 

does she think she can keep 
    this emissary of air? 
         Is it trust or illness 

that allows the head 
   —sleek tulip—to bow 
         on its bent stem 

across her arm? 
    Look at the steady, 
         quiet eye. She is carrying 

the bird back from indifference, 
    from the coast 
         of whatever rearrangement 

the elements intend, 
    and the loon allows her. 
         She is going to call 

the Center for Coastal Studies, 
    and will swaddle the bird 
         in her petal-bright coat 

until they come. 
    She cradles the wild form. 
         Stubborn girl. 


       6. NEW DOG 

Jimi and Tony 
can’t keep Dino, 
their cocker spaniel; 
Tony’s too sick, 
the daily walks 
more pressure 
than pleasure, 
one more obligation 
that can’t be met. 

And though we already 
have a dog, Wally 
wants to adopt, 
wants something small 
and golden to sleep 
next to him and 
lick his face. 
He’s paralyzed now 
from the waist down, 

whatever’s ruining him 
moving upward, and 
we don’t know 
how much longer 
he’ll be able to pet 
a dog. How many men 
want another attachment, 
just as they’re 
leaving the world? 

Wally sits up nights 
and says, I’d like   
some lizards, a talking bird, 
some fish. A little rat. 

So after I drive 
to Jimi and Tony’s 
in the Village and they 
meet me at the door and say, 
We can’t go through with it,   

we can’t give up our dog, 
I drive to the shelter 
—just to look—and there 
is Beau: bounding and 
practically boundless, 
one brass concatenation 
of tongue and tail, 
unmediated energy, 
too big, wild, 

perfect. He not only 
licks Wally’s face 
but bathes every 
irreplaceable inch 
of his head, and though 
Wally can no longer 
feed himself he can lift 
his hand, and bring it 
to rest on the rough gilt 

flanks when they are, 
for a moment, still. 
I have never seen a touch 
so deliberate. 
It isn’t about grasping; 
the hand itself seems 
almost blurred now, 
softened, though 
tentative only 

because so much will 
must be summoned, 
such attention brought 
to the work—which is all 
he is now, this gesture 
toward the restless splendor, 
the unruly, the golden, 
the animal, the new.

text : 
I seemed always standing 
before a door 
to which I had no key, 
although I knew it hid behind it 
a gift for me. 

Until one day I closed 
my eyes a moment, stretched 
then looked once more. 
And not surprised, I did not mind it 
when the hinges creaked 
and, smiling, Death 
held out his hands to me.

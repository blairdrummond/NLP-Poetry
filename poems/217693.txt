4TH CENTURY B.C. 

How beautiful, my wellbeloved, is your body of granite— 
It smites my eyes like an army with banners. 
Your lips are the red wine poured from goatskin bags, 
Your brows are warriors' full-drawn bows, 
Your glances the arrows they shoot therefrom, 
And your hair is the mane of a lion, tawny and thick. 

17TH CENTURY 

Let us not love tonight past mind 
       But stifle our intent 
Lest blazing passion, unconfined, 
       Provoke imperilment. 

Against the dark, our fierce desire 
       Would flare too bright for sight, 
So must we tame our blinding fire 
       And bank it for the night. 

With luminating dawn's return 
       And appetite's increase 
Our lusty flame can safely burn 
       In furious release. 

18TH CENTURY 

Since even modest airs and prudish dress 
May not deter rash beaux from wantonness, 
Can your unsullied innocence o'ervault 
Concupiscent intention to assault? 
My sweet, have no misgivings, for you wear 
So plainly insurmountable an air 
That ogling lechers, hunting am'rous game, 
Will blush, apologize, and flee in shame. 

19TH CENTURY 

Ethereal nightingale, gallantly singing 
       Your heart out in rich melodies 
       To insentient stones, earless trees, 
And indifferent insects, forsake them! Go winging 
To town like a dart to the mark, I implore you, 
       And, serving as courier bird, 
       Tell her who is waiting this word: 
"I'm locked in my room and can't come but adore you."

Sonnet

Since there is no escape, since at the end
    My body will be utterly destroyed, 
This hand I love as I have loved a friend,
    This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed; 
Since there is no escape even for me
    Who love life with a love too sharp to bear: 
The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea
    And hours alone too still and sure for prayer--
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more 
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
    In pride, and let me sing with my last breath; 
In these few hours of light I lift my head; 
Life is my lover--I shall leave the dead
    If there is any way to baffle death.

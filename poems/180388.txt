title : Sower

author : Bei Dao

text : 
a sower walks into the great hall 
it's war out there, he says 
and you awash in emptiness 
you've sworn off your duty to sound the alarm 
I've come in the name of fields 
it's war out there 

I walk out from that great hall 
all four directions a boundless harvest scene 
I start planning for war 
rehearsing death 
and the crops I burn 
send up the wolf-smoke of warning fires 

but something haunts me furiously: 
he's sowing seed across marble floors

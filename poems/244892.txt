 The way my daughter sleeps it’s as if she’s talking
 to the dead. Now she is one. I watch her eyes roll
 backwards in her head, her senses fold
  
 one by one, and then her breathing quiets to a beat.
 Every night she fights this silent way of being
 with all the whining ammunition that she has.
  
 She wins a tired story, a smothered song, the small
 and willful links to life that carry her away.
 Welcome to the Egyptian burial. She’s gone to Hades
  
 with her stuffed animals. When she wakes,
 the sad circles disappeared, she blinks
 before she knows me. I have listened
  
 to one million breaths of her. And every night
 my body seizes when she leaves to go
 where I am not, and yet every night I urge her, go.

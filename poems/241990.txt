					Late for the feast. Let me guess, she said, everything workedagainst you.Some pulverize experiences at the pool. When the air slaps, theyflip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. Thestratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. And how is one to read a nod? Is a nod an exclamation?Does one kiss after a nod?A woman mutters something about the tea being too weak.The walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutterjouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use ofthe word was a considerable error. A most lamentable error, givenhalf of us are illiterate and unattached. Think of words in theirsystem of birth. Now do you see, the teacher said. Ah, see.Dogs were barking for no reason.Some of us went to the ghats and watched the dead burn. Womanin white wailed, her hair a dumb struck line against her rockingspine. We look for other distractions in a place of death.In the afternoon meanings are extolled.We are asked to name our loves. I will not, he said, use commonlanguage to talk of love. I will not jump into the substancewithout reinforcement. He took his body to the breeze andswayed till we begged him to stop. The rain subsided but we werestill wet.Thousands have died in a nod.

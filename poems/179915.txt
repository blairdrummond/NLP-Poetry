title : Very Strong February

author : Bernadette Mayer

text : 
A man and a woman pretend to be white ice 
Three men at the lavender door are closed in by the storm 
With strong prejudice and money to buy the green pines 
One weekend fisherman and blue painters watch 
The vivid violet winds blow visibility from the mountain 
Beyond the black valley. That means or then you know 
You’re in a big cloud of it, it’s brilliant white mid-February 
A week or two left on distracting black trees 
Before the brownish buds obscure your view of the valley again. 

Looking for company four dark men and a burnt sienna woman 
Come in for three minutes, then bye-bye like a gold watch left on the 
                  chair 
Or part of the sum of what big white families think up 
To store for long yellow Sundays to eat for brown ecological 
                  company. 
At some point later gorgeous red adventure stops, did you forget 
To turn it down and laugh in the face of the fearful white storm 
                  anyway 
Or picture it brilliant blue for a further Sunday memory 
In a coloring book, you talk as lightly as you can 
Refusing a big pink kiss, you burned the Sunday sauce 
Of crushed red tomatoes, you turn it down to just an orange glow. 
This particular storm, considering the pause and the greenish thaw before it 
Reminds me in its mildness of imitating a sea-green memory that is 
                  actually 
In the future, I imitate an imagined trumpet sound 
Or the brilliant purple words of a man or woman I haven’t met yet 
Or perhaps it’s a grey-haired man I already know who said some- 
                  thing yesterday 
To a mutual friend who will give me the whole story in black and 
                  white tomorrow 
Or the day after, just as the big orange plows for the local businesses 
Go to work to push away the rest of the white snow that will fall 
                  tonight.

title : This Morning I Could Do/A Thousand Things

I could fix the leaky pipe
 Under the sink, or wander over 
And bother Jerry who’s lost
 In the bog of his crankcase.
 I could drive the half-mile down 
To the local mall and browse 
Through the bright stables
 Of mowers, or maybe catch
 The power-walkers puffing away 
On their last laps. I could clean 
The garage, weed the garden,
 Or get out the shears and
 Prune the rose bushes back.
 Yes, a thousand things
 This beautiful April morning. 
But I’ve decided to just lie
 Here in this old hammock, 
Rocking like a lazy metronome, 
And wait for the day lilies
 To open. The sun is barely
 Over the trees, and already
 The sprinklers are out,
 Raining their immaculate
 Bands of light over the lawns.

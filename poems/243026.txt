I like to lie with you wordless
 on black cloud rooft beach
 in late june 5 o’clock tempest
 on clump weed bed with sand
 fitting your contours like tailor made
  
 and I like to wash my summer brown face
 in north cold hudson rapids
 with octagon soap
   knees niched in steamy rocks
   where last night’s frog stared
   at our buddhist sleep
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 I like to go down vertical mountains
 where lanny goshkitch
 meditated
   crashing poplars
   sap sticky arms flailing
   as thermosed green tea
   anoints sneakers
   and blood soakt brow I taste and love
   myself a split second
  
 and I like to feel my own full scrotum
 as I horizon the whole crisp linen earth
 in my beatitude waiting miguel-like
 in maskt fantasy for christ-like
 you—
 whoever you are
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 I like to look at books howl
 haikus of the seasons
 of the mind
 that I might know the knowing
 and the simplest to think of all of us
 taking turns at catching each other
 in the rye
  
 and I like to taste cold absinthe
 on hot hung sunday mornings
 discussing orgies symposiums
 and sounds with hoary headed poets
 in upstairs jazz club
 in Japan
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen when k and ike still sleep
 and only the denver night riders hum contrasts
 to orient jazzy feather beasts
 in the dewy garden of real earth
 where I can sink my naked feet
 cool

1. 

That woman still lives at her ranch. 
You can ask her. Maybe 
She knows. As near and far 

As the rest of us can tell 
The barn and sheds were built 
In the Great Depression. Someone 

Had money and a big idea. 
Far and away the biggest 
Idea I’ve ever seen. 

Pat says there must’ve been 
A hundred men, shepherds 
And shearers, working there. 

It’s one of those things 
That not only is, but seems, 
Larger inside than out, 

Like a planetarium or an orange, 
Even with Wyoming around it, 
And real stars flying away. 

Just stick your head in there; 
Its dark will make you dizzy. 
It has an underneath 

Too low to stand in unless 
You are a sheep. The loft 
Vaults like a dusky church. 


    2. 

All that summer 
I balanced water, 

Coaxing the desert 
Into pasture, 

With eight cubic feet 
Per second for two 

Thousand acres. 
Horseback, shovel 

On my shoulder along 
Miles of ditches: 

Stalling here, 
Releasing there, 

Water over 
The deepening green, 

Keeping it living: 
Herons and cranes 

Regal in meadows, 
Strings of ducklings 

Frothing the ditch 
To get away. 


    3. 

One day riding ditches I saw Clay. 
He was on the hill against the sky, 
Flapping his arms at me. 
They were going to bulldoze the corrals at the shearing sheds, 
Intricate maze of gates and pens 
Clay, as a kid, had built with his father, 
Before they lost their ranch, before Frank died, 
Before the family had to move away. 

The new owner was razing everything. 
I guess he had some kind of idea. 
Clay didn’t need any gates, but, as Pat said, 
That’s Clay. 
I met them at the shearing sheds. 
Pat held a wrecking bar like a steel snake. 
I just can’t stand tearin’ apart all them guys’s dreams, 
he said, looking shy. 
Hell is when you know where you are.

On the barn roof a loose piece of tin 
Flaps in the wind like a broken wing. 
Wyoming whirls in the sun. 

Up in the loft a pair of shears, 
Oh, fifty or sixty years forgotten there, 

Floats in noonlight, bearing up some dust, 
Just a pair of spring-steel scissors, 
Two knives joined at the hip, with smiling edges. 

An owl the color of things left alone 
Flaps out of the gable door. 

Hell is when you know where you are: 
Mazes of pens and gates dreaming sheep; 
Miles of ditches dreaming green. 


    5. 

No one living knows 
Who built the shearing sheds, 
Unless maybe that woman, 
And I’m not about to ask her, 
Ever since she tried 
To stab her husband with a pair of scissors. 
He was ninety-one 
And barely held her off. 
Later she claimed she was just 
Trying to cut his heart 
Medication out of his shirt 
Pocket — dope, she called it — 
And the old man had to leave 
The ranch, where he didn’t last long. 

They bulldozed the corrals. 
We got forty gates. 
We took them someplace safe. 


    6. 

Now the vast, dim barn floats like an ocean liner 
Whose doldrums are meadows spinning into brush, 
And everywhere you look Wyoming hurries off. 

All night the stars make their escape. 
In the loft a pair of shears cuts woolly moonlight. 
All day a piece of roofing slaps in the wind. 

A startled owl flaps out of the gable. 
Hell is when you know where you are and it’s beautiful. 
You saved the gates for nothing. 

You balanced the water to keep the green from spinning 
Away into sage, the same gray as the wing 
That just now shaded your eyes.

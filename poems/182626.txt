text : 
If the sea is a cathedral, a tide pool 
is a chapel. Sculpins dart under the wind 
that blusters their cupped oceans. 
Sculpted by wave on rock, their pockets of salt 
grow thin from the rain, the suffocating 
fresh water. Sculpin and hermit crab and limpet 
endure the sea's absence, the lost comfort 
of constant temperature, while the unconceived 
sky drums the roof over their pooled world 
with litanies of unbreathable torrent. 

Christ, I have no praise for you. 
Beyond saying a vodka-wrecked troller 
and shacks the color of the desire to die, beyond 
saying predatory snails that glide on their bellies 
like the penitent, flexing their borers, 
beyond saying seraphim that bicker exactly like gulls, 
the shells that are my ears 
sing no psalms except I can name 
many small creatures in the world of a tide pool. 
Christ, have mercy on all things that drown in air, 
I have no praise for you. I say the tide: 
Tide! 
Tide! 
Tide! 
I say: Ebb! 
Flood! 
Ebb! 
Flood! 
I always start with "Ebb!" 
I always end with "Flood!"

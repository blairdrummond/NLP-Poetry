title : Necessities

In through our bedroom window, the full dawn-scape concusses. 
Difficult to sustain sleep's equilibrium of wordlessness. 
Naming anything, like stepping barefoot in wet sand up to my ankles. 
Name after name, sinking me farther beneath waking's buoyancy.

House, this morning, is pale with the rush of what night siphoned off. 
Objects, still emptied of resemblance, hum their chord-less cantos. 
Bloodless, my knuckles knock on walls without echo, testing singularities.

Sun on the cutlery offers an ageless sheen. 
Though it ages the silver relentlessly.

New, but still rudimentary tools to be gleaned from my over-used weaponry.

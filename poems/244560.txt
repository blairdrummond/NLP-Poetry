title : A Rose for George

If you don’t have any control over your life and being happy
 If you don’t have any control over your life and be happy
  
 A family in the wall
 Mouse avenue in kitchen
 A piece of cake
 Looms oozing
 Men and women are signs of life
 Children are signs of life
  
 When they put the cap on the oil well
 I thought my life pollutes
 Reading lamp = coal burn
 My failures to love
 To be friend family
  
 When are we given the right to control
 Fantasy?
  
 Sixty-eight is a little bit of
 Time in the world
 To be more sentient
 Kinder and “get up try again”
 Body ow
  
 I pretend if I were in New York
 I could choose friends as I did in school
 Fork into flesh of animal
  
 Work all your life
 Not hard enough! there are things undone
  
 I was thinking you were my father
 I wasn’t here, then I was
 Through you
  
 Through an internal externalized
 Spill
  
 It bumps around the world
 Tries not to be stupid
  
 When Dad you grew up
 Trying to intentionalize
 Family back of you
 George, young and into the continents
 With problems
  
 I already have what I desire
 I just have it in the future
 The structure of being is wanting
 And like a fountain I suck up
 Later
 My excesses
 A little evaporates
 One day it’s dry and drying
 Means I’m done
 Oh whatever you’ll always be there no?
  
 I can say when I die
 “I was agent of clock”
  
 They call it an alarm
 I stopped having time to weed, friends
  
 Started in dark
 Light housed me
  
 The TV is so loud I can’t think
 I’m sorry I can’t be in that room
  
 Nobody has yelled at me for a long time
 Thank you
  
 You exist because your dad and mom
 And you tried to go away
  
 Continuity sweepstakes
 Freed under the cap
  
 Get up orderly   loving

1. 

It was winter, lunar, wet. At dusk 
Pewter seedlings became moonlight orphans. 
Pleased to meet you meat to please you 
said the butcher's sign in the window in the village. 

Everything changed the year that we got married. 
And after that we moved out to the suburbs. 
How young we were, how ignorant, how ready 
to think the only history was our own. 

And there was a couple who quarreled into the night, 
Their voices high, sharp: 
nothing is ever entirely 
right in the lives of those who love each other. 

               2. 

In that season suddenly our island 
Broke out its old sores for all to see. 
We saw them too. 
We stood there wondering how 

the salt horizons and the Dublin hills, 
the rivers, table mountains, Viking marshes 
we thought we knew 
had been made to shiver 

into our ancient twelve by fifteen television 
which gave them back as gray and grayer tears 
and killings, killings, killings, 
then moonlight-colored funerals: 

nothing we said 
not then, not later, 
fathomed what it is 
is wrong in the lives of those who hate each other. 

             3. 

And if the provenance of memory is 
only that—remember, not atone— 
and if I can be safe in 
the weak spring light in that kitchen, then 

why is there another kitchen, spring light 
always darkening in it and 
a woman whispering to a man 
over and over what else could we have done? 

               4. 

We failed our moment or our moment failed us. 
The times were grand in size and we were small. 
Why do I write that 
when I don't believe it? 

We lived our lives, were happy, stayed as one. 
Children were born and raised here 
and are gone, 
including ours. 

As for that couple did we ever 
find out who they were 
and did we want to? 
I think we know. I think we always knew.

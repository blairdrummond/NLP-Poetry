title : White Ash Goes Up at a Touch

author : Todd Boss

text : 
while the black oak 

takes coaxing.   
That popping and 

whistling? Yellow   
birch and red pine.   

Difference   
might for now define,   

but soon the whole   
church is chanting 

at the same time,   
flame splashing   

bright from the dirty   
bucket of the earthly,   

roaring likeness 
and only likeness 

into the bottomless   
cool of the night . . .

text : 
He glanced around to check if the treacherous gods 
had really given him the reward promised for his accomplished song 
and there she was, Eurydice restored, perfectly naked and fleshed 
in her rhyming body again, the upper and lower smiles and eyes, 
the line of mouth-sternum-navel-cleft, the chime of breasts and hips 
and of the two knees, the feet, the toes, and that expression 
of an unimaginable intelligence that yoked all these with a skill 
she herself had forgotten the learning of: there she was, with him 
                  once more 
just for an instant as she vanished. And then he heard her from 
                  behind 
the invisible veil, absence: a shrill and batlike but lexical indictment. 
Why had he violated the divine command, why, when he had seized 
all song to himself and robbed her of power to open her own 
                  oblivion? 
It grew in volume and now seemed to spew from an insane old 
                  mother with one breast 
hanging like a huge withered testicle from a rent in her weathered 
                  gown, 
who was being watched by a tall woman, copper-helmet-coiffed, 
                  richly suited in salmon colour, 
a mythical allusion, since salmon were long extinct in the bays and 
                rivers here: 
songs never brought them anymore. The young restrained breasts 
                and the old free one 
oppressed him equally and he went to live among men, waiting for 
                the crazy 
and the competent to join forces and come for him with their 
                  scissors. 
Orpheus listened patiently to my poem and when it quieted he said 
                  to me: 
That wasn't it at all. I sang outward from my face to blue spaces 
                  between clouds, 
to fern fronds, and men and women sipped my song as you drink 
                   from a stream going by. 
What I sang is lost in time, you don't kmow what it was, all you have 
                  is your own 
old stories about me. And if women tore me into pieces, maybe that 
                  only signifies 
each one keeps part of my body, which is melody among visible 
                  things.

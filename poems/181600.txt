title : Ornithogalum Dubium

Lame again, I limp home along Lawn Terrace 
with a flowering sun star in a paper wrap 

then back to the village with a lame cat 
twisting and woeful in her cage. 

Bread these days isn't baked to last: 
how sad those posh loaves thudding off 

in pine breadbins all around the Heath: 
soulless latterday pets, frisky for a day   

or two, then binned or thrown to foxes, 
loaves just an inch of gloom below 

the caged birds you notice in corners 
of those same mansions when you seek 

the past, dinking their mirrors, dipping 
once in a while for a sip of milk.

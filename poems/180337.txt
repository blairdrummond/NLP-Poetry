title : Stand Whoso List

author : Sir Thomas Wyatt

text : 
Stand whoso list upon the slipper top 
   Of court’s estates, and let me here rejoice; 
And use me quiet without let or stop, 
   Unknown in court, that hath such brackish joys: 
      In hidden place, so let my days forth pass, 
   That when my years be done, withouten noise, 
      I may die agèd after the common trace, 
For him death gripeth right hard by the crope 
   That is much known of other; and of himself alas, 
   Doth die unknown, dazed with dreadful face.

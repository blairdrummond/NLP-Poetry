title : Tam Glen

author : Robert Burns

text : 
My heart is a-breaking, dear Tittie, 
         Some counsel unto me come len'; 
To anger them a' is a pity, 
         But what will I do wi' Tam Glen? 

I'm thinking, wi' sic a braw fellow, 
         In poortith I might mak a fen': 
What care I in riches to wallow, 
         If I mauna marry Tam Glen? 

There's Lowrie, the laird o' Dumeller, 
         "Guid-day to you,"—brute! he comes ben: 
He brags and he blaws o' his siller, 
         But when will he dance like Tam Glen? 

My minnie does constantly deave me, 
         And bids me beware o' young men; 
They flatter, she says, to deceive me; 
         But wha can think sae o' Tam Glen? 

My daddie says, gin I'll forsake him, 
         He'll gie me guid hunder marks ten: 
But, if it's ordain'd I maun take him, 
         O wha will I get but Tam Glen? 

Yestreen at the valentines' dealing, 
         My heart to my mou gied a sten: 
For thrice I drew ane without failing, 
         And thrice it was written, "Tam Glen"! 

The last Halloween I was waukin 
         My droukit sark-sleeve, as ye ken: 
His likeness cam up the house staukin, 
         And the very gray breeks o' Tam Glen! 

Come counsel, dear Tittie, don't tarry; 
         I'll gie ye my bonie black hen, 
Gif ye will advise me to marry 
         The lad I lo'e dearly, Tam Glen.

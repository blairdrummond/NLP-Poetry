Sonnet

Like bodiless water passing in a sigh, 
Thro' palsied streets the fatal shadows flow, 
And in their sharp disastrous undertow 
Suck in the morning sun, and all the sky. 
The towery vista sinks upon the eye, 
As if it heard the Hebrew bugles blow, 
Black and dissolved; nor could the founders know 
How what was built so bright should daily die. 

Thy mood with man's is broken and blent in, 
City of Stains! And ache of thought doth drown 
The primitive light in which thy life began; 
Great as thy dole is, smirched with his sin, 
Greater and elder yet the love of man 
Full in thy look, tho' the dark visor's down.

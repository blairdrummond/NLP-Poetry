ON THE BIRTH OF A SON
When a child is born, the parents say 
they hope it's healthy and intelligent. But as for me— 

well, vigor and intelligence have wrecked my life. I pray 
this baby we are seeing walloped, wiped and winningly anointed, 

turns out dumb as oakum—and more sinister. That way 
he can crown a tranquil life by being 

appointed a cabinet minister.

title : Brief reflection on killing the Christmas carp

author : Miroslav Holub

text : 
You take a kitchen-mallet 
and a knife 
and hit 
the right spot, so it doesn’t jerk, for 
jerking means only complications and reduces profit. 

And the watchers already narrow their eyes, already admire the   
            dexterity, 
already reach for their purses. And paper is ready 
for wrapping it up. And smoke rises from chimneys. 
And Christmas peers from windows, creeps along the ground 
and splashes in barrels. 

Such is the law of happiness. 

I am just wondering if the carp is the right creature. 

A far better creature surely would be one 
which—stretched out—held flat—pinned down— 
would turn its blue eye 
on the mallet, the knife, the purse, the paper, 
the watchers and the chimneys 
and Christmas, 

And quickly 

say something. For instance 

These are my happiest days; these are my golden days. 
Or 
The starry sky above me and the moral law within me, 
Or   
And yet it moves. 

Or at least 
Hallelujah!

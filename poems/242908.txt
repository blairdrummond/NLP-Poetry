title : Holding On

1.
  
 How account
 for dimming
 of the lights
  
 baggage 
 of old age
 tagged and waiting?
  
 or light tricks
 in snow
 at sun-up?
  
 waiting in line
  
 waiting in line
  
 come sundown
 watching the horizon
 eyes glowing.
  
  

 2.
  
 Who
  
 not the 
 other myself
 my prisoner
  
 night flesh
 ear-skewered
  
 music
 in natural
 air
  
 screams   well-deep
 seep to the brain-root
  
 days
 Treblinka nights
  
 guilt
 guts the ferret
 in my cage
  
 sanity puddles the floor.
  
  

 3.
  
 In memory sickness
  
 eyes unlace
  
 open
 as last night’s boots
  
 a glacier of light
 saps the air
  
 remember 
  
 the torturer’s 
 tinnitus 
 starts the day.
  
  

 4.
  
 The   irrationality
 of it
  
 mob noise
  
 angels struck
 from the block
 of darkness
  
 a sunlit sky breaks
 through in shrapnel
  
 hard screaming night
  
 feather touch
  
 troops improvising
 for the kill
  
 panic
  
 my enemy
  
 my nail-hold.
  
  

 5.
  
 Of the texture
 of elbows shattered
 and stairwell falls
  
 hallucinations 
 of confession
  
 rush to stop pain.
  
  

 6.
  
 Andean snow-stats
 blind me
  
 the flashlight 
 of the Burglar
 of Death flares
  
 and holds 
 on my eyes.
  
  

 7.
  
 In the Feast Halls
  
 ghosts linger
  
 feeding
  
 avoiding
  
 dogs
  
 and the memory
  
 of cracked bones.
  
  

 8.
  
 Present danger
  
 colors hiss
 from a blue masque
  
 bone-bonded
  
 Autumn in no
 year’s season
  
 a nerve twitches
 across the path.
  
  
  
 9. 
  
 Planets by lamplight
  
 street laughter
 embraced in being
  
 parallel lines
 collapse curbside
  
 cornices fall
  
 from a stranger’s dream
 moon-sand ears
  
 the inhabitants
 lean in to hear.

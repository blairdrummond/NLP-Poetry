title : Bearings

The marriage ran under their skin, a rash, or maybe
 all that red wine, luminescent cocktail hours
 in which lost books were rediscovered, or just a rash,
 a reaction sending out runners across her chest,
 a vine, something close, ruby scarves coming back
 into fashion, their son coming back
 from school, from the yard, but now, dinnertime
 and the family parted, split houses, her ex and his anger
 spread down the long hallway of their house
 and into the windows of her new apartment, their daughter’s doubled
 beds, her doubled face in family portraits that double
 in frequency, a family set down and another, this dinnertime
 and more red wine, our faces flush with love and sympathy,
 the mother decides to see the son again, and so
 our doubled flashlights giving us heaven and earth,
 all of it safe or at least unmoving, the tall fence
 her ex built to hide the little grave, to guard the lot 
 in this registered historic district (all of the houses
 bear their stories on a plaque, their first stories,
 run-on, this little town with no street lights, just moon,
 cedars), the tall fence behind which is the yard, blue,
 in this yard no marker stone and under this stone
 their son’s everything, no double,
 no double

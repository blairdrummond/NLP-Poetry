title : A Thanksgiving to God, for his House

author : Robert Herrick

text : 
Lord, Thou hast given me a cell 
         Wherein to dwell, 
A little house, whose humble roof 
         Is weather-proof: 
Under the spars of which I lie 
         Both soft, and dry; 
Where Thou my chamber for to ward 
         Hast set a guard 
Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep 
         Me, while I sleep. 
Low is my porch, as is my fate, 
         Both void of state; 
And yet the threshold of my door 
         Is worn by th' poor, 
Who thither come and freely get 
         Good words, or meat. 
Like as my parlour, so my hall 
         And kitchen's small; 
A little buttery, and therein 
         A little bin, 
Which keeps my little loaf of bread 
         Unchipp'd, unflead; 
Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar 
         Make me a fire, 
Close by whose living coal I sit, 
         And glow like it. 
Lord, I confess too, when I dine, 
         The pulse is Thine, 
And all those other bits, that be 
         There plac'd by Thee; 
The worts, the purslain, and the mess 
         Of water-cress, 
Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent; 
         And my content 
Makes those, and my beloved beet, 
         To be more sweet. 
'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth 
         With guiltless mirth; 
And giv'st me wassail-bowls to drink, 
         Spic'd to the brink. 
Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand 
         That soils my land; 
And giv'st me, for my bushel sown, 
         Twice ten for one; 
Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay 
         Her egg each day; 
Besides my healthful ewes to bear 
         Me twins each year; 
The while the conduits of my kine 
         Run cream, for wine. 
All these, and better, Thou dost send 
         Me, to this end, 
That I should render, for my part, 
         A thankful heart, 
Which, fir'd with incense, I resign, 
         As wholly Thine; 
But the acceptance, that must be, 
         My Christ, by Thee.

title : The Age of Dinosaurs

There are, of course, theories 
about the wide-eyed, drop-jawed 
fascination children have for them, 
about how, before he's learned 
his own phone number or address, 
a five-year-old can carry 
like a few small stones 
the Latin tonnage of those names, 
the prefixes and preferences 
for leaf or meat. 

My son recites the syllables 
I stumble over now, 
sets up figures as I did 
years ago in his prehistory. 
Here is the green ski slope 
of a brontosaur's back, 
there a triceratops in full 
gladiator gear. From the arm 
of a chair a pterodactyl 
surveys the dark primeval carpet. 

Each has disappeared from time 
to time, excavated finally 
from beneath a cabinet 
or the sofa cushions, only 
to be buried again among its kind 
in the deep toy chest, 
the closed lid snug as earth. 
The next time they're brought out 
to roam the living room 
another bone's been found 

somewhere, a tooth or fragment 
of an eggshell dusted off, 
brushing away some long-held notion 
about their life-span 
or intelligence, warm blood 
or cold. On the floor 
they face off as if debating 
the latest find, what part 
of which one of them 
has been discovered this time. 

Or else they stand abreast 
in one long row, side 
by scaly side, waiting to fall 
like dominoes, my son's 
tossed tennis ball a neon yellow 
asteroid, his shadow a dark cloud 
when he stands, his fervor for them 
cooling so slowly he can't feel itâ€” 
the speed of glaciers, maybe, 
how one age slides into the next.

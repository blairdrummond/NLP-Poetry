title : The Empty Dance Shoes

author : Cornelius Eady

My friends, 
As it has been proven in the laboratory,   
An empty pair of dance shoes 
Will sit on the floor like a wart 
Until it is given a reason to move. 

Those of us who study inertia 
(Those of us covered with wild hair and sleep) 
Can state this without fear: 
The energy in a pair of shoes at rest   
Is about the same as that of a clown 

Knocked flat by a sandbag. 
This you can tell your friends with certainty:   
A clown, flat on his back, 
Is a lot like an empty pair of 
    dancing shoes. 

An empty pair of dancing shoes 
Is also a lot like a leaf   
Pressed in a book. 
And now you know a simple truth: 
A leaf pressed in, say, The Colossus 
    by Sylvia Plath, 
Is no different from an empty pair of dance shoes 

Even if those shoes are in the middle of the Stardust Ballroom   
With all the lights on, and hot music shakes the windows   
    up and down the block. 
This is the secret of inertia: 
The shoes run on their own sense of the world.   
They are in sympathy with the rock the kid skips   
    over the lake 
After it settles to the mud. 
Not with the ripples, 
But with the rock. 

A practical and personal application of inertia 
Can be found in the question:   
Whose Turn Is It 
To Take Out The Garbage?   
An empty pair of dance shoes 
Is a lot like the answer to this question, 
As well as book-length poems 
Set in the Midwest. 

To sum up: 
An empty pair of dance shoes 
Is a lot like the sand the 98-pound weakling   
    brushes from his cheeks 
As the bully tows away his girlfriend.   
Later, 

When he spies the coupon at the back of the comic book, 
He is about to act upon a different set of scientific principles.   
He is ready to dance.

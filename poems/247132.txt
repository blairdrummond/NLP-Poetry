title : Two Hear Cicadas

BEEF: We are here between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung 
in a queue of escalating beadsâ€”

BEEF: It's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt

BEEF: a tee and a circle wherever it may 
be there was music coming on

BEEF: which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never 
springs, but waves through

BEEF: like wired applause for antic backstage 
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it 
fades

BEEF: but only after the chorus has pulsed

BEEF: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain 
water gone dross

BEEF: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc
fully quiet...

BEEF: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's 
circuit opens to one

BEEF: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings in sudden 
white-rumped ascent

BEEF: unopposed by iridescence

BEEF: unopposed by iridescence

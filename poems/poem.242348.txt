Couplet, Epigram

Wotton, the country and the country swain,
 How can they yield a Poet any sense?
 How can they stir him up, or heat his vein?
 How can they feed him with intelligence?
 You have that fire which can a wit enflame,
 In happy London England's fairest eye:
 Well may you Poets' have of worthy name,
 Which have the food and life of Poetry.
      And yet the country or the town may sway,
      Or bear a part, as clowns do in a play.

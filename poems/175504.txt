title : A World of Light

author : John Reibetanz

If I close my eyes now, I can still see them 
canopied by the visor of my sunhat: 
three children islanded on a narrow rim 
of earth between the huge crack-willow that 
they squat before, hushed, poised to net a frog, 
and the pond the frog will jump to (it got away) 
a glass its dive will shatter. 
                                             The unbroken image 
pleases my mind’s eye with its density, 
such thick crisscross of tree-trunk, earth, and tall grass 
I see no breach, no source for the light that steeps it 
but a blue burning in the pond’s green glass. 

The grass withered, the tree blew down, earth caught 
the frog, the children grew. Sky’s ice-blue flame 
teased along the wick it would consume.

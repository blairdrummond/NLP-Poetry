title : Taking to the Hills

author : Rachel Wetzsteon

If walking, like wine, only abets a sad mood
 let’s try it, I said, and I did:
 over these hills that have never known sorrow
 no thoughtful moon passes. Dig until a hill is level, and unearth
 only earth. Take pride in knowing the chemical makeup
 of rain, the sum total of harmful vapors in any sunset.
 For if you must drag in the old lines 
 about suicidal willows, star’s stacked for or against you,
 you clutter a limitless, soaring landscape
 with your own baggage. Night of love, 
 day of omens of night, great mountain
 of realized hopes, valley where bitter winds
 blow the dispossessed into raving lunatics—
 what are they but shady projections
 of passing whims, vastly oversimplified versions
 of something infinitely greater? This vision before you
 is nothing but a triad of trees, hills, river,
 steadfast and eternal. But soon you start to feel restless
 and when, setting out to take a roll of photos,
 you note the disturbing absence of a road,
 your suavity crumbles: you deafen the sky
 and serenade the moon, fall prostrate before pines
 saying oh, come back, spirit of the place which,
 lifeless without you, blossoms into something
 sumptuously more than mediating madness;
 come back, massive oaks that await our coming;
 to carve initials is to be truly human;
 the days are dappled with our passions,
 the mountains rise and fall with our glories and follies.

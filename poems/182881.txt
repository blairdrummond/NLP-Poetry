title : [The wild and wavy event]

text : 
The wild and wavy event 
now chintz at the window 

was revolution . . . 
Adams 

to Miss Abigail Smith: 
You have faults 

You hang your head down 
like a bulrush 

you read, you write, you think 
but I drink Madeira 

to you 
and you cross your Leggs 

while sitting. 
(Later:) 

How are the children? 
If in danger run to the woods. 

Evergreen o evergreen 
how faithful are your branches.

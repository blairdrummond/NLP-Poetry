a servant 

We were together since the War began. 
He was my servant--and the better man.


a son 

My son was killed while laughing at some jest.    I would I knew 
What it was, and it might serve me in a time when jests are few.


an only son 

I have slain none except my Mother.    She 
(Blessing her slayer) died of grief for me.


ex-clerk 

Pity not!    The Army gave 
Freedom to a timid slave: 
In which Freedom did he find 
Strength of body, will, and mind: 
By which strength he came to prove 
Mirth, Companionship, and Love: 
For which Love to Death he went: 
In which Death he lies content.


the wonder 

Body and Spirit I surrendered whole 
To harsh Instructors--and received a soul . . . 
If mortal man could change me through and through 
From all I was--what may The God not do?

This man in his own country prayed we know not to what Powers. 
We pray Them to reward him for his bravery in ours.


the coward 

I could not look on Death, which being known, 
Men led me to him, blindfold and alone.


shock 

My name, my speech, my self I had forgot. 
My wife and children came--I knew them not. 
I died.    My Mother followed.    At her call 
And on her bosom I remembered all.


a grave near cairo 

Gods of the Nile, should this stout fellow here 
Get out--get out!    He knows not shame nor fear.

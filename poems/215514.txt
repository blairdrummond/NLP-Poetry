(At What Used to Be Called Idlewild)
The line didnâ€™t move, though there were not 
many people in it. In a half-hearted light
the lone agent dealt patiently, noiselessly, endlessly 
with a large dazed family ranging
from twin toddlers in strollers to an old lady 
in a bent wheelchair. Their baggage
was all in cardboard boxes. The plane was delayed, 
the rumor went through the line. We shrugged, 
in our hopeless overcoats. Aviation
had never seemed a very natural idea.

Bored children floated with faces drained of blood. 
The girls in the tax-free shops stood frozen 
amid promises of a beautiful life abroad.
Louis Armstrong sang in some upper corner, 
a trickle of ignored joy.
Outside, in an unintelligible darkness
that stretched to include the rubies of strip malls, 
winged behemoths prowled looking for the gates 
where they could bury their koala-bear noses 
and suck our dimming dynamos dry.

Boys in floppy sweatshirts and backward hats 
slapped their feet ostentatiously
while security attendants giggled
and the voice of a misplaced angel melodiously 
parroted FAA regulations. Women in saris
and kimonos dragged, as their penance, behind them
toddlers clutching Occidental teddy bears, 
and chair legs screeched in the food court 
while ill-paid wraiths mopped circles of night 
into the motionless floor.

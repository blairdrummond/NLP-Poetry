Whitecaps surge in from some infinite distance 
Rocks, grottoes, clay stridencies beneath the storm 
Amalgams of sea-wrack and brownish moss 
Each tide pushes forth its flesh-antennae 
The persistent squid stretches its arms, wave-crests 
Cave in, everything gives way to sand 
Which silently drinks up the acid, cold red sweat 
Those children launched in assault against the waves 
How could they turn their heads 
Back toward those who've brought them this far 
To be taken even farther in their turn 
They passed though the crowd, laughing 
Or crying without telling the password 
They've passed, the ferret runs and runs 
Memory, the battlefield nurse, can barely 
Triage the rarest ones 
Whose heat shifts at the crater's edge 
Yet they give our trajectory 
Its dreamlike depth: the whole chain 
Coils up in our smallest cells 
And in a lifetime time annuls itself

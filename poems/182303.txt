title : [up from slobbery]

author : Harryette Mullen

text : 
up from slobbery 
hip hyperbole 
the soles of black feet 
beat down back streets 

a Yankee porkchop 
for your knife and fork 
your fill of freedom 
in Philmeyork 

never trouble rupture 
urban space fluctuates 
gentrify the infrastructure 
feel up vacant spades 

no moors steady whores 
studs warn no mares 
blurred rubble slew of vowels 
stutter war no more

title : Finale

author : Pablo Neruda

text : 
Matilde, years or days   
sleeping, feverish,   
here or there, 
gazing off, 
twisting my spine,   
bleeding true blood,   
perhaps I awaken   
or am lost, sleeping: 
hospital beds, foreign windows, 
white uniforms of the silent walkers, 
the clumsiness of feet. 

And then, these journeys   
and my sea of renewal:   
your head on the pillow,   
your hands floating 
in the light, in my light,   
over my earth. 

It was beautiful to live   
when you lived! 

The world is bluer and of the earth   
at night, when I sleep 
enormous, within your small hands.

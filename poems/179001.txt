title : Silent Music

author : Floyd Skloot

text : 
My wife wears headphones as she plays 
Chopin etudes in the winter light. 
Singing random notes, she sways 
in and out of shadow while night 
settles. The keys she presses make a soft 
clack, the bench creaks when her weight shifts, 
golden cotton fabric ripples across 
her shoulders, and the sustain pedal clicks. 
This is the hidden melody I know 
so well, her body finding harmony in 
the give and take of motion, her lyric 
grace of gesture measured against a slow 
fall of darkness. Now stillness descends 
to signal the end of her silent music.

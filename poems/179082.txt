title : Adam’s Task

author : John Hollander

And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field ... GEN. 2:20
Thou, paw-paw-paw; thou, glurd; thou, spotted 
   Glurd; thou, whitestap, lurching through   
The high-grown brush; thou, pliant-footed, 
   Implex; thou, awagabu. 

Every burrower, each flier 
   Came for the name he had to give:   
Gay, first work, ever to be prior,   
   Not yet sunk to primitive. 

Thou, verdle; thou, McFleery’s pomma; 
   Thou; thou; thou—three types of grawl;   
Thou, flisket; thou, kabasch; thou, comma- 
   Eared mashawk; thou, all; thou, all. 

Were, in a fire of becoming, 
   Laboring to be burned away, 
Then work, half-measuring, half-humming,   
   Would be as serious as play. 

Thou, pambler; thou, rivarn; thou, greater   
   Wherret, and thou, lesser one; 
Thou, sproal; thou, zant; thou, lily-eater.   
   Naming’s over. Day is done.

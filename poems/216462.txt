title : To My Father's Business

author : Kenneth Koch

text : 
Leo bends over his desk    
Gazing at a memorandum    
While Stuart stands beside him    
With a smile, saying,    
"Leo, the order for those desks    
Came in today    
From Youngstown Needle and Thread!"    
C. Loth Inc., there you are    
Like Balboa the conqueror    
Of those who want to buy office furniture    
Or bar fixtures    
In nineteen forty in Cincinnati, Ohio!    
Secretaries pound out    
Invoices on antique typewriters—    
Dactyllographs    
And fingernail biters.    
I am sitting on a desk    
Looking at my daddy    
Who is proud of but feels unsure about    
Some aspects of his little laddie.    
I will go on to explore    
Deep and/or nonsensical themes    
While my father's on the dark hardwood floor    
Hit by a couple of Ohio sunbeams.    
Kenny, he says, some day you'll work in the store.    
But I felt "never more" or "never ever"    
Harvard was far away    
World War Two was distant    
Psychoanalysis was extremely expensive    
All of these saved me from you.    
C. Loth you made my father happy    
I saw his face shining    
He laughed a lot, working in you    
He said to Miss Ritter    
His secretary    
"Ritt, this is my boy, Kenny!"    
"Hello there Kenny," she said    
My heart in an uproar    
I loved you but couldn't think    
Of staying with you    
I can see the virtues now    
That could come from being in you    
A sense of balance    
Compromise and acceptance—    
Not isolated moments of brilliance    
Like a girl without a shoe,    
But someone that you    
Care for every day—    
Need for customers and the economy    
Don't go away.    
There were little pamphlets    
Distributed in you    
About success in business    
Each about eight to twelve pages long    
One whole series of them    
All ended with the words    
"P.S. He got the job"    
One a story about a boy who said,    
"I swept up the street, Sir,    
Before you got up." Or    
"There were five hundred extra    catalogues    
So I took them to people in the city who have a dog"—    
P.S. He got the job.    
I didn't get the job    
I didn't think that I could do the job    
I thought I might go crazy in the job    
Staying in you    
You whom I could love    
But not be part of    
The secretaries clicked    
Their Smith Coronas closed at five p.m.    
And took the streetcars to Kentucky then    
And I left too.

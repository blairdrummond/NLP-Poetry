Alas, so all things now do hold their peace! 
   Heaven and earth disturbed in no thing; 
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease, 
   The nightes car the stars about doth bring; 
Calm is the sea; the waves work less and less: 
   So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring, 
Bringing before my face the great increase 
   Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing, 
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case. 
   For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring: 
But by and by, the cause of my disease 
   Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting, 
When that I think what grief it is again 
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.

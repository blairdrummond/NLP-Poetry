title : Justice, Come Down

author : Minnie Bruce Pratt

text : 
A huge sound waits, bound in the ice, 
in the icicle roots, in the buds of snow 
on fir branches, in the falling silence 
of snow, glittering in the sun, brilliant
as a swarm of gnats, nothing but hovering 
wings at midday. With the sun comes noise. 
Tongues of ice break free, fall, shatter, 
splinter, speak. If I could write the words.

Simple, like turning a page, to say Write 
what happened, but this means a return
to the cold place where I am being punished. 
Alone to the stony circle where I am frozen, 
the empty space, children, mother, father gone, 
lover gone away. There grief still sits
and waits, grim, numb, keeping company with 
anger. I can smell my anger like sulfur-
struck matches. I wanted what had happened 
to be a wall to burn, a window to smash. 
At my fist the pieces would sparkle and fall. 
All would be changed. I would not be alone.

Instead I have told my story over and over 
at parties, on the edge of meetings, my life 
clenched in my fist, my eyes brittle as glass.

Ashamed, people turned their faces away 
from the woman ranting, asking: Justice, 
stretch out your hand. Come down, glittering, 
from where you have hidden yourself away.

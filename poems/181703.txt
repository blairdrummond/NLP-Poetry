title : The Storm Is Over

author : Jason Guriel

text : 
But now it’s raining 
below the greener clouds 
of trees that were absorbent 
but only up to a point. 
And these raindrops 
strained by treetops 
should (you would think) 
be filtered and finer 
and therefore pure 
(and not Chinese 
water torture’s 
fatter, darker drops 
that always pick out 
of all possible bull’s-eyes 
your bald spot). 
But these are late, last drops 
and a little bloated 
like late, last poems 
by name your poet.

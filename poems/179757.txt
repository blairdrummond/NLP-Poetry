title : The Drowned Children

author : Louise Gl√ºck

text : 
You see, they have no judgment. 
So it is natural that they should drown, 
first the ice taking them in 
and then, all winter, their wool scarves 
floating behind them as they sink 
until at last they are quiet. 
And the pond lifts them in its manifold dark arms. 

But death must come to them differently, 
so close to the beginning. 
As though they had always been 
blind and weightless. Therefore 
the rest is dreamed, the lamp, 
the good white cloth that covered the table, 
their bodies. 

And yet they hear the names they used 
like lures slipping over the pond: 
What are you waiting for 
come home, come home, lost 
in the waters, blue and permanent.

title : Son of Fog

author : Dean Young

text : 
When the fog burns off and the air's pulverized   
diamonds and you can see beyond the islands   
of forever!—far too dramatic for me. It hurts   
something behind my eyes near the sphenoid,   
not good. I prefer fog with fog behind it,   
uninflammable fog. Then there's no competition   
for brightness, no Byron for your Shelley,   
no Juno eclisping your Athena, no big bridge   
statement about bringing unity to landmasses.   
All the thought balloons are blank. The marching   
band can't practice, even a bird's got to get   
within five feet before it can start an argument.   
Like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned   
nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle   
of mortality. A foglike baby god   
picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely   
then goes back to playing with her feet.   
I have felt awful cold and lonely and fog   
has been blotting paper to my tears.   
My dog is fog and I don't have to scoop   
its poop with my hand in a plastic bag.   
There are sensations that begin in the world,   
the mind responding with ideas but then   
those ideas cause other sensations.   
What a mess. We stand at the edge   
of a drop that doesn't answer back,   
fog our only friend although it's hell   
on shrimpboats. There, there, says the fog.   
Where, where? You can't see a thing.

My father liked them separate, one there, 
one here (allá y aquí), as if aware 

that words might cut in two his daughter’s heart 
(el corazón) and lock the alien part 

to what he was—his memory, his name 
(su nombre)—with a key he could not claim. 

“English outside this door, Spanish inside,” 
he said, “y basta.” But who can divide 

the world, the word (mundo y palabra) from 
any child? I knew how to be dumb 

and stubborn (testaruda); late, in bed, 
I hoarded secret syllables I read 

until my tongue (mi lengua) learned to run 
where his stumbled. And still the heart was one. 

I like to think he knew that, even when, 
proud (orgulloso) of his daughter’s pen, 

he stood outside mis versos, half in fear 
of words he loved but wanted not to hear.

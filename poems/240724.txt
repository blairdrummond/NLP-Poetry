The heretic’s papers were spread out on the armchair
  
 *
  
 At the window, fruit of
 spring,
 you can bite again
 against the weather
  
 weapons I let fall outside
 pharmacies, drowsy and bright
  
 *
  
 Air comes to the confused bends in the rail where
 in a mirror lush food puts you
 out for 1 night. Then it is the weather
 at noon that prepares to spring on you
 in December, a month ago
 blowing the lights out with a sob
  
 *
  
 On long walks
 a poorly tuned radio
  
 in my world     my  head
 with a star attached
 swims back
  
 *
  
 Useless—it was the wrong tree
 but the flag in the school
 breeze scans the men and women on my sleeve
  
 *
  
 A . . . turned her head towards the open window
 of the shop. The voice was low.
 It did not sound like a man’s voice.
  
 *
  
 Eighteen trees starting from the end
 of the block
 outside the pharmacy, with beards today
 to the subway, station, steps
  
 of a land-post
  
 “screen my heart”

 Under the dog’s neck
 When the radio went on. Doctor
 He moved his face away to
 The pines, a deep thought.
 The trees, for a few seconds they were
 Real to him, his ears stopped
 The river where no life could touch him.
 He pressed his ear against the cold
 Shrill whine. Dusty legs
 Wondered why they had sent him
 To this place, they feared the cobwebs
 Were swaying on the unique bed.
 Mown grass has the peppery smell
 Of being crowded together on 
 This bed, and a feeling of dark apprehension
 Came over him. I watch a horse
 Gather speed, look at a movie
 With you. Your words are the grime
 On the sidestreet, down towards the river,
 Yellow in the cold glare of floodlights
 In the yard. In the middle of the line
 I repeated your instructions,
 I puzzled with a stranger does to you
 In a dream. Chunks
 Of meat are marked
 Cars following me as a thought follows
 Us from the motel. Father 
 Has read these latinized titles
 Aloud, but failed
 And gave place to some smooth yellowish substance,
 Checked by no one as he rubbed the sponge-
 Like doll. It had some hair
 But its legs did not tempt me,
 The sponginess gave place to the tubes themselves.
 Colleagues efficiently solve an aggressive
 Blank to be expected as we sat at the breakfast 
 Table near the door. A tree blocked 
 Her hair spread and fell over the wheel.
 But the living room shows its trimming of thick straw—
 The bad mechanic sets the bread on the white cloth

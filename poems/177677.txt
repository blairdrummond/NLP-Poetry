nothing to drink in 
the refrigerator but juice from   
the pickles come back 
long dead, or thin 
catsup. i feel i am old 

now, though surely i 
am young enough? i feel that i have had   
winters, too many heaped cold 

and dry as reptiles into my slack skin.   
i am not the kind to win 
and win. 
no i am not that kind, i can hear 

my wife yelling, “goddamnit, quit

i wonder about everything: birds 
clamber south, your car 
kaputs in a blazing, dusty 
nowhere, things happen, and constantly you 

wish for your slight home, for 
your wife’s rusted 
voice slamming around the kitchen. so few 

of us wonder why 
we crowded, as strange, 
monstrous bodies, blindly into one   
another till the bed 

choked, and our range 
of impossible maneuvers was gone, 
but isn’t it because by dissolving like so   
much dust into the sheets we are crowding 

south, into the kitchen, into   
nowhere?

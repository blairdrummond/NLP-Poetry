After explanations and regulations, he 
Walked warily in. 
Black hair covered his chin, subscribing to 
Villainous ideal. 
“This can not be real,” he thought, “this is a 
Classical mistake; 
This is a cake baked with embarrassing icing; 
Somebody’s got 
Likely as not, a big fat tongue in cheek! 
What have I to do 
With a prim and proper-blooded lady?” 
Christ in deed has risen 
When a Junkie in prison visits with a Wasp woman. 

“Hold your stupid face, man, 
Learn a little grace, man; drop a notch the sacred shield. 
She might have good reason, 
Like: ‘I was in prison and ye visited me not,’ or—some such. 
So sweep clear 
Anachronistic fear, fight the fog, 
And use no hot words.” 

After the seating 
And the greeting, they fished for a denominator, 
Common or uncommon; 
And could only summon up the fact that both were human. 
“Be at ease, man! 
Try to please, man!—the lady is as lost as you: 
‘You got children, Ma’am?’” he said aloud. 

The thrust broke the dam, and their lines wiggled in the water. 
She offered no pills 
To cure his many ills, no compact sermons, but small 
And funny talk: 
“My baby began to walk... simply cannot keep his room clean...” 
Her chatter sparked no resurrection and truly 
No shackles were shaken 
But after she had taken her leave, he walked softly, 
And for hours used no hot words.

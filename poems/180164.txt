made a name for themselves 
and it was Spot. He's gone to some 
utopos now, the dirty dog, doctor of   
crotches, digger of holes. Your airy clarities be damned,   
he loved our must and our mistakes — why hit him, then, 
who did us good? He's dead, he ought 
to be at home. He's damned   
put out, and so am I.

When blue is carried out, the law is red. 
When noon is said and done, it's dusk again. 
The greed for table makes the greed for bed.   
So cave canem, even stars have litters — little   
lookers, cacklers, killers . . . Morning raises up   
the hackled men. (What's   
milk, among our ilk, but   
opportunity for spillers?)

He saved our sorry   
highfalutin souls — the heavens haven't saved a fly. Orion's   
canniness who can condone? — that starring story, strapping blade! —

But O the family dog, the Buddha-dog — son of a bitch! 
he had a funny bone —

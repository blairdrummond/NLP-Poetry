title : Like Coins, November

author : Elizabeth Klise von Zerneck

text : 
We drove past late fall fields as flat and cold 
as sheets of tin and, in the distance, trees 

were tossed like coins against the sky. Stunned gold 
and bronze, oaks, maples stood in twos and threes: 

some copper bright, a few dull brown and, now 
and then, the shock of one so steeled with frost

it glittered like a dime. The autumn boughs 
and blackened branches wore a somber gloss

that whispered tails to me, not heads. I read 
memorial columns in their trunks; their leaves

spelled UNUM, cent; and yours, the only head . . .Â  
in penny profile, Lincoln-like (one sleeve,

one eye) but even it was turning tails 
as russet leaves lay spent across the trails.

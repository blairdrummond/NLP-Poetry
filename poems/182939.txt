title : Winter Journal: Scratchings among the Burnings

text : 
clouds in rafts above, upon one another, pushed up along 
       the margin of sky 
       dark underbellies 
Shirring of grasses and the nearly empty apple tree behind 
Where is this beginning from? 
The roll of clouds bolsters up close 
       moves vaguely east 
Hear the interstate, its rush of backdrop constant 
Oh those deep colors are something sacred 
There are patches of olive green, chartreuse, umber, piled 
       against each other, snapping and smoking almost 
       and then the empty prongs and systems 
       cross-hatchings 
       against the grays, burnished and glowing 
The cloud roll has changed now, been buffeted slowly 
       into bunches, disorganizing 
Oh, these torches before me that seem to burn brighter 
       as the light fades 
This aching gradation, smear and 
       gleam-forth and then the bare black hands up through 
       splaying and forcing the crowns 
       so slightly, just a tender worrying up from inside 
       the swollen gloves, the spheres of them, the undoing 
       the serial falling-off 
Furious brocade, yes, devastation 
That one oak in its torque 
and above, against the maddening subtle surface of the sky 
       the barely defined roads upon it, the passages 
       the growings-forth 
       gobbed and wrought, rich impasto 
       stubborn, unbecoming 
Now the grays, almost purple, seem to move forward 
       branching up from out of the background 
       darkening forth 
       surge from within the mass 
       organisms coming up against each other, bulging and turning 
       off, roiling 
       slow and mesmeric 
       the contained motion of it rooted 
       static movement, within stasis 
       painstaking 
       damage then recovery, damage then recovery 
A lighter band of sky now, stratum between dark cloud and 
       complicated span of tree-frieze 
       layering, up-changing 
       free-needled, built-up duns and copperings 
       score and rose-green gore, stitch and fret 
       always upon the under-thing, the broad backing up over 
       the one

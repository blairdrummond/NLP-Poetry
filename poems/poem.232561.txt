Rhymed Stanza

To-day's most trivial act may hold the seed
   Of future fruitfulness, or future dearth; 
Oh, cherish always every word and deed!
   The simplest record of thyself hath worth.

If thou hast ever slighted one old thought,
   Beware lest Grief enforce the truth at last; 
The time must come wherein thou shalt be taught
   The value and the beauty of the Past.

Not merely as a warner and a guide,
   "A voice behind thee," sounding to the strife; 
But something never to be put aside,
   A part and parcel of thy present life.

Not as a distant and a darkened sky,
   Through which the stars peep, and the moonbeams glow;
But a surrounding atmosphere, whereby
   We live and breathe, sustained in pain and woe.

A shadowy land, where joy and sorrow kiss, 
   Each still to each corrective and relief,
Where dim delights are brightened into bliss, 
   And nothing wholly perishes but Grief.

Ah, me!--not dies--no more than spirit dies; 
   But in a change like death is clothed with wings; 
A serious angel, with entranced eyes,
   Looking to far-off and celestial things.

title : Poem about My Rights

author : June Jordan

text : 
Even tonight and I need to take a walk and clear   
my head about this poem about why I can’t   
go out without changing my clothes my shoes   
my body posture my gender identity my age 
my status as a woman alone in the evening/   
alone on the streets/alone not being the point/ 
the point being that I can’t do what I want   
to do with my own body because I am the wrong   
sex the wrong age the wrong skin and   
suppose it was not here in the city but down on the beach/   
or far into the woods and I wanted to go   
there by myself thinking about God/or thinking   
about children or thinking about the world/all of it   
disclosed by the stars and the silence:   
I could not go and I could not think and I could not   
stay there   
alone   
as I need to be   
alone because I can’t do what I want to do with my own   
body and   
who in the hell set things up   
like this   
and in France they say if the guy penetrates   
but does not ejaculate then he did not rape me   
and if after stabbing him if after screams if   
after begging the bastard and if even after smashing   
a hammer to his head if even after that if he   
and his buddies fuck me after that   
then I consented and there was   
no rape because finally you understand finally   
they fucked me over because I was wrong I was   
wrong again to be me being me where I was/wrong 
to be who I am   
which is exactly like South Africa   
penetrating into Namibia penetrating into 
Angola and does that mean I mean how do you know if 
Pretoria ejaculates what will the evidence look like the 
proof of the monster jackboot ejaculation on Blackland 
and if 
after Namibia and if after Angola and if after Zimbabwe 
and if after all of my kinsmen and women resist even to 
self-immolation of the villages and if after that 
we lose nevertheless what will the big boys say will they 
claim my consent: 
Do You Follow Me: We are the wrong people of 
the wrong skin on the wrong continent and what 
in the hell is everybody being reasonable about 
and according to the Times this week 
back in 1966 the C.I.A. decided that they had this problem 
and the problem was a man named Nkrumah so they 
killed him and before that it was Patrice Lumumba 
and before that it was my father on the campus 
of my Ivy League school and my father afraid 
to walk into the cafeteria because he said he 
was wrong the wrong age the wrong skin the wrong 
gender identity and he was paying my tuition and 
before that 
it was my father saying I was wrong saying that   
I should have been a boy because he wanted one/a 
boy and that I should have been lighter skinned and 
that I should have had straighter hair and that 
I should not be so boy crazy but instead I should 
just be one/a boy and before that          
it was my mother pleading plastic surgery for 
my nose and braces for my teeth and telling me 
to let the books loose to let them loose in other 
words 
I am very familiar with the problems of the C.I.A. 
and the problems of South Africa and the problems 
of Exxon Corporation and the problems of white 
America in general and the problems of the teachers 
and the preachers and the F.B.I. and the social 
workers and my particular Mom and Dad/I am very 
familiar with the problems because the problems   
turn out to be   
me 
I am the history of rape   
I am the history of the rejection of who I am   
I am the history of the terrorized incarceration of   
myself   
I am the history of battery assault and limitless   
armies against whatever I want to do with my mind   
and my body and my soul and   
whether it’s about walking out at night   
or whether it’s about the love that I feel or   
whether it’s about the sanctity of my vagina or   
the sanctity of my national boundaries   
or the sanctity of my leaders or the sanctity   
of each and every desire   
that I know from my personal and idiosyncratic   
and indisputably single and singular heart   
I have been raped   
be- 
cause I have been wrong the wrong sex the wrong age   
the wrong skin the wrong nose the wrong hair the   
wrong need the wrong dream the wrong geographic   
the wrong sartorial I   
I have been the meaning of rape   
I have been the problem everyone seeks to   
eliminate by forced   
penetration with or without the evidence of slime and/   
but let this be unmistakable this poem   
is not consent I do not consent   
to my mother to my father to the teachers to   
the F.B.I. to South Africa to Bedford-Stuy   
to Park Avenue to American Airlines to the hardon   
idlers on the corners to the sneaky creeps in   
cars   
I am not wrong: Wrong is not my name 
My name is my own my own my own   
and I can’t tell you who the hell set things up like this 
but I can tell you that from now on my resistance   
my simple and daily and nightly self-determination   
may very well cost you your life

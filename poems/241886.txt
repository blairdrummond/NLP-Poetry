title : Into the Mud

author : Joyce Sidman

text : 


Sun
slant low,
chill seeps into black
water. No more days of bugs
and basking. Last breath, last sight
of light and down I go, into the mud. Every
year, here, I sink and settle, shuttered like a
shed.  Inside, my eyes close, my heart slows
to its winter rhythm.  Goodbye, good-
bye! Remember the warmth. 
Remember the quickness.
Remember me.
Remember.

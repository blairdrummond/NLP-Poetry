title : Who Am I?

author : Carl Sandburg

text : 
My head knocks against the stars. 
My feet are on the hilltops. 
My finger-tips are in the valleys and shores of universal life. 
Down in the sounding foam of primal things I reach my hands and play with pebbles of destiny. 
I have been to hell and back many times. 
I know all about heaven, for I have talked with God. 
I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible. 
I know the passionate seizure of beauty 
And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs reading "Keep Off." 

My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive in the universe.

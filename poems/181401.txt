title : Shiver & You Have Weather

author : Matthea Harvey

text : 
In the aftermath of calculus 
your toast fell butter-side down. 

Squirrels swarmed the lawns 
in flight patterns. The hovercraft 

helped the waves along. From 
every corner there was perspective. 

On the billboards the diamonds 
were real, in the stores, only zirconia. 

I cc’ed you. I let you know. 
Sat down to write the Black Ice Memo. 

Dinner would be meager & 
reminiscent of next week’s lunch. 

So what if I sat on the sectional? 
As always I was beside myself.

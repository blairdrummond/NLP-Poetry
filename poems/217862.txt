title : Obbligato

author : Bruce Smith

text : 
Late August was a pressure drop,   
rain, a sob in the body,   

a handful of air    
with a dream in it,    

summer was desperate    
to paradise itself with blackberry   

drupelets and swarms, everything   
polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps    

gushing, the stars like sweat   
on a boxer's skin. A voice   

from the day says   
Tax cuts    

for the rich or scratch   
what itches or it's a sax   

from Bitches Brew,   
and I'm a fool    

for these horns   
and hues, this maudlin    

light. It's a currency of feeling    
in unremembered March.   

There's a war on and snow in the 
                        city   
where we've made our desire stop   

and start. In the dying school of Bruce   
I'm the student who still believes   

in the bad taste of the beautiful   
and the sadness of songs   

made in the ratio   
of bruise for bruise.

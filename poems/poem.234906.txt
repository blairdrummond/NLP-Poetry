Day in Autumn 
Rainer Maria Rilke 
1875-1926

Germany
Nature, Fall, Religion



After the summer's yield, Lord, it is time 
to let your shadow lengthen on the sundials 
and in the pastures let the rough winds fly. 

As for the final fruits, coax them to roundness. 
Direct on them two days of warmer light 
to hale them golden toward their term, and harry 
the last few drops of sweetness through the wine. 

Whoever's homeless now, will build no shelter; 
who lives alone will live indefinitely so, 
waking up to read a little, draft long letters,   
and, along the city's avenues, 
fitfully wander, when the wild leaves loosen.

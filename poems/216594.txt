For James Richardson
Gerard, juke-step Jerry, little wrestler, soul-mess 
of sinew and mind-sight, fired spark, joyed Jesuit, 
grief-clog too, but a Pan-flute in every Ave, you half-nelson 
the syntax dandies, ram them to canvas, sit upon and pin 

the god-fops, minions of ghost tomes, trite chimes, 
though you walk among them, too, jig and roar 
of black-robed stroll in golden-grove and choral iambs. 
You were, yes, that falcon flight, the labor, soar, and 

dive, but buzzard nose for carrion, too, sniffed your own, 
knew, alone, the rot, rope-knot or buckle of roots under-on 
rock, your gowned back to roses, rosaries, but eyes a song gone 
up, too, sickly little wings stuck in God-glue air: how long? 

You sang one dialectic flight, sirâ€”the only kind. How high 
can the swallow swoop, how low the falcon grieve, relieve, 
in fall till pinions hold him, there, to kill? Light- 
weight, mutt, heaver of iron, scrap,feather: I believe 

the hurt, believe you saw what you saw.

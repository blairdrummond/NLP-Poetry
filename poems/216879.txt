title : Music

author : George Scarbrough

text : 
Han-Shan sits on a flat stone 
In his garden and plays the flute, 
Mimicking the birds singing among 
The gourd vines or from the top 
Of the blue pine tree. 

Or he constructs a new trellis 
For the rambling rose over his front 
Gate or works at the great loom in his porch, 
Weaving his own coverlets. 

Sometimes, he paints drinking gourds 
To hang at his cold spring. 

His poems, delicate but strong, 
Paper the ceiling above his bed, 
So he can lie and read 
His own masterpieces. 

No man, he avers, can catch 
Such fish in one basket.

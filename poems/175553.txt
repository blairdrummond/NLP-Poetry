title : X Mon. December [1744] hath xxxi days.

author : Benjamin Franklin

text : 
This World’s an Inn, all Travellers are we; 
And this World’s Goods th’Accommodations be. 
Our Life is nothing but a Winter’s Day; 
Some only break their Fast, and so away. 
Others stay Dinner, and depart full fed. 
The deepest Age but sups and goes to bed. 
He’s most in Debt that lingers out the Day; 
Who dies betimes has less and less to pay.

title : A Fable

author : Louise Glück

text : 
Two women with 
the same claim 
came to the feet of 
the wise king. Two women, 
but only one baby. 
The king knew 
someone was lying. 
What he said was 
Let the child be 
cut in half; that way 
no one will go 
empty-handed. He 
drew his sword. 
Then, of the two 
women, one 
renounced her share: 
this was 
the sign, the lesson. 
Suppose 
you saw your mother 
torn between two daughters: 
what could you do 
to save her but be 
willing to destroy 
yourself—she would know 
who was the rightful child, 
the one who couldn’t bear 
to divide the mother.

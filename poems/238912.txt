after Kafka

In fat armchairs sat
indolence and impatience,
plotting my downfall

      *

A wicked cage flew
across the long horizon
searching for a bird.

      *

I burned with love in
empty rooms, I sternly turned
knives within myself.

      *

“Behold the bright gate,”
the keeper said. “I am now
going to shut it.”

      *

Hardly was the road
swept clean when ah! there appeared
new piles of dry leaves.

      *

But nothing could kill
a faith like a guillotine,
as heavy, as light.

      *

Happiness? Finding
your indestructible core;
leaving it alone.

      *

Into the heavens
flew a breathless legion of
impossible crows.

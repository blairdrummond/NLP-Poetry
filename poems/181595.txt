soon, industry and agriculture converged 
                        and the combustion engine 
sowed the dirtclod truck farms green   
                                  with onion tops and chicory 

mowed the hay, fed the swine and mutton   
                      through belts and chutes 

cleared the blue oak and the chaparral 
                                    chipping the wood for mulch 

back-filled the marshes 
                        replacing buckbean with dent corn   

removed the unsavory foliage of quag 
                                 made the land into a production 
made it produce, pistoned and oiled 
                              and forged against its own nature 


and—with enterprise—built silos 
                            stockyards, warehouses, processing plants 
abattoirs, walk-in refrigerators, canneries, mills 
                                                                & centers of distribution   

it meant something—in spite of machinery— 
                      to say the country, to say apple season 
though what it meant was a kind of nose-thumbing   
                                           and a kind of sweetness 
                      as when one says how quaint 
knowing that a refined listener understands the doubleness 


and the leveling of the land, enduing it in sameness, cured malaria 
as the standing water in low glades disappeared, 
                                                       as the muskegs drained                               
typhoid and yellow fever decreased 
                                  even milksickness abated 
thanks to the rise of the feeding pen 
                         cattle no longer grazing on white snakeroot 

vanquished:    the germs that bedeviled the rural areas 
                                                       the rural areas also 
vanquished:    made monochromatic and mechanized, made suburban 


now,   
the illnesses we contract are chronic illnesses:    dyspepsia, arthritis 
            heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, asthma 
                           chronic pain, allergies, anxiety, emphysema 
                                       diabetes, cirrhosis, lyme disease, aids 
            chronic fatigue syndrome, malnutrition, morbid obesity   
hypertension, cancers of the various kinds:    bladder bone eye lymph   
                     mouth ovary thyroid liver colon bileduct lung   
                               breast throat & sundry areas of the brain   


we are no better in accounting for death, and no worse:       we still die 
we carry our uninhabited mortal frames back to the land 
                      cover them in sod, we take the land to the brink   
          of our dying:    it stands watch, dutifully, artfully 
enriched with sewer sludge and urea 
                                             to green against eternity of green 


hocus-pocus:    here is a pig in a farrowing crate 
                                     eating its own feces   
human in its ability to litter inside a cage 
                        to nest, to grow gravid and to throw its young 

I know I should be mindful of dangerous analogy: 
          the pig is only the pig 
                         and we aren't merely the wide-open field 
                                    flattened to a space resembling nothing 



you want me to tell you the marvels of invention?    that we persevere 
that the time of flourishing is at hand?    I should like to think it 

meanwhile, where have I put the notebook on which I was scribbling 

it began like: 
                     "the smell of droppings and that narrow country road . . ."

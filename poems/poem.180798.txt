A Thousand Martyrs

Love, Romantic Love, Realistic & Complicated



A thousand martyrs I have made, 
   All sacrificed to my desire; 
A thousand beauties have betrayed, 
   That languish in resistless fire. 
The untamed heart to hand I brought, 
And fixed the wild and wandering thought. 

I never vowed nor sighed in vain 
   But both, though false, were well received. 
The fair are pleased to give us pain, 
   And what they wish is soon believed. 
And though I talked of wounds and smart, 
Love's pleasures only touched my heart. 

Alone the glory and the spoil 
   I always laughing bore away; 
The triumphs, without pain or toil, 
   Without the hell, the heav'n of joy. 
And while I thus at random rove 
Despise the fools that whine for love.

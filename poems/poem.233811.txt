A narrow fellow in the grass (1096) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Animals, Nature



A narrow fellow in the grass 
Occasionally rides; 
You may have met him--did you not 
His notice sudden is, 
 The grass divides as with a comb, 
A spotted shaft is seen, 
And then it closes at your feet, 
And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,   
A floor too cool for corn,
But when a boy and barefoot, 
I more than once at noon 
Have passed, I thought, a whip lash, 
Unbraiding in the sun, 
When stooping to secure it, 
It wrinkled and was gone. 

Several of nature's people 
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport 
Of cordiality. 
 But never met this fellow, 
Attended or alone, 
Without a tighter breathing, 
And zero at the bone.

title : The Death of Antinoüs

author : Mark Doty

text : 
When the beautiful young man drowned— 
accidentally, swimming at dawn 
in a current too swift for him, 
or obedient to some cult 
of total immersion that promised 
the bather would come up divine, 

mortality rinsed from him— 
Hadrian placed his image everywhere, 
a marble Antinoüs staring across 
the public squares where a few dogs 
always scuffled, planted 
in every squalid little crossroads 

at the furthest corners of the Empire. 
What do we want in any body 
but the world? And if the lover’s 
inimitable form was nowhere, 
then he would find it everywhere, 
though the boy became simply more dead 

as the sculptors embodied him. 
Wherever Hadrian might travel, 
the beloved figure would be there 
first: the turn of his shoulders, 
the exact marble nipples, 
the drowned face not really lost 

to the Nile—which has no appetite, 
merely takes in anything 
without judgment or expectation— 
but lost into its own multiplication, 
an artifice rubbed with oils and acid 
so that the skin might shine. 

Which of these did I love? 
Here is his hair, here his hair 
again. Here the chiseled liquid waist 
I hold because I cannot hold it. 
If only one of you, he might have said 
to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere, 

would speak. Or the statues might have been enough, 
the drowned boy blurred as much by memory 
as by water, molded toward an essential, 
remote ideal. Longing, of course, 
become its own object, the way 
that desire can make anything into a god.

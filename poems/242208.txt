for Lem ﻿
As if your half-witted tongue
 Spoke with an eloquence
 Death bestows, I heard your voice
 Muffled through the dark
 Layers of cemetery loam:
  
 “They found me black-suited
 In the shuttered half-dark, my eyes
 Dug like claws into the clouds’
 Soft feather-turnings. What kept me
 Separate the broiling sun
  
 Of intellect now shone on fiercely:
 In the sheep-pens stinking
 Of dung and lanolin,
 I buried my face in the ewe’s
 Swollen side and listened
  
 For the lamb the way
 The night sky listens
 To the synapse-fire
 Of meteors, the fibrillating
 Heartbeat of the stars.
  
 I heard the cells crackle
 Into being, the embryonic
 Brain begin to burn:
 Hunger. Thirst. Beneath my ear
 My own disastrous birthing,
  
 The umbilicus strangling
 Like a whip around my neck,
 Shoved through the momentary
 Breach memory tore open—
 Dying revealed to me my birth,
  
 How half my brain went dark,
 One side of a universe
 Pinched out like a candle:
 Just smart enough to sense
 My difference, yet not know why—
  
 Even my death was the thrust
 Of a bewildering punchline: On Thanksgiving
 Morning mouthwatering
 Pain shoved like a spit
 From my bowels to my brain.”

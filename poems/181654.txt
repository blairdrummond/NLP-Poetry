title : Dead Butterfly

text : 
For months my daughter carried   
a dead monarch in a quart mason jar.   
To and from school in her backpack,   
to her only friend’s house.   At the dinner table   
it sat like a guest alongside the pot roast.   
She took it to bed, propped by her pillow.   

Was it the year her brother was born?   
Was this her own too-fragile baby   
that had lived—so briefly—in its glassed world?   
Or the year she refused to go to her father’s house?   
Was this the holding-her-breath girl she became there?   

This plump child in her rolled-down socks   
I sometimes wanted to haul back inside me   
and carry safe again.   What was her fierce   
commitment?   I never understood.   
We just lived with the dead winged thing   
as part of her, as part of us,   
weightless in its heavy jar.

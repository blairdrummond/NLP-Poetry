title : Backdrop addresses cowboy

Starspangled cowboy
sauntering out of the almost-
silly West, on your face
a porcelain grin,
tugging a papier-mâché cactus
on wheels behind you with a string,

you are innocent as a bathtub 
full of bullets.

Your righteous eyes, your laconic 
trigger-fingers
people the streets with villains:
as you move, the air in front of you 
blossoms with targets

and you leave behind you a heroic 
trail of desolation:
beer bottles
slaughtered by the side
of the road, bird-
skulls bleaching in the sunset.

I ought to be watching
from behind a cliff or a cardboard storefront 
when the shooting starts, hands clasped 
in admiration,
but I am elsewhere. 

Then what about me

what about the I
confronting you on that border, 
you are always trying to cross?

I am the horizon
you ride towards, the thing you can never lasso

I am also what surrounds you: 
my brain
scattered with your
tincans, bones, empty shells, 
the litter of your invasions.

I am the space you desecrate 
as you pass through.

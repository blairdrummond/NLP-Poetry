Couplet

Fair was the morning, fair our tempers, and
 We had seen nothing fairer than that land,
 Though strange, and the untrodden snow that made
 Wild of the tame, casting out all that was
 Not wild and rustic and old; and we were glad.
  
 Fair, too, was afternoon, and first to pass
 Were we that league of snow, next the north wind.
  
 There was nothing to return for, except need,
 And yet we sang nor ever stopped for speed,
 As we did often with the start behind.
 Faster still strode we when we came in sight
 Of the cold roofs where we must spend the night.

 Happy we had not been there, nor could be.
 Though we had tasted sleep and food and fellowship
 Together long. 
                            "How quick" to someone's lip
 The words came, "will the beaten horse run home."
  
 The word "home" raised a smile in us all three,
 And one repeated it, smiling just so
 That all knew what he meant and none would say.
 Between three counties far apart that lay
 We were divided and looked strangely each
 At the other, and we knew we were not friends
 But fellows in a union that ends
 With the necessity for it, as it ought. 

 Never a word was spoken, not a thought
 Was thought, of what the look meant with the word
 "Home" as we walked and watched the sunset blurred.
 And then to me the word, only the word,
 "Homesick," as it were playfully occurred:
 No more. If I should ever more admit
 Than the mere word I could not endure it
 For a day longer: this captivity
 Must somehow come to an end, else I should be
 Another man, as often now I seem,
 Or this life be only an evil dream.

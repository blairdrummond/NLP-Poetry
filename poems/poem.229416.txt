Dramatic Monologue, Persona

The press of the Spoon River Clarion was wrecked, 
And I was tarred and feathered, 
For publishing this on the day the Anarchists were hanged in Chicago: 
"I saw a beautiful woman with bandaged eyes 
Standing on the steps of a marble temple. 
Great multitudes passed in front of her, 
Lifting their faces to her imploringly. 
In her left hand she held a sword. 
She was brandishing the sword, 
Sometimes striking a child, again a laborer, 
Again a slinking woman, again a lunatic. 
In her right hand she held a scale; 
Into the scale pieces of gold were tossed 
By those who dodged the strokes of the sword. 
A man in a black gown read from a manuscript: 
'She is no respecter of persons.' 
Then a youth wearing a red cap 
Leaped to her side and snatched away the bandage. 
And lo, the lashes had been eaten away 
From the oozy eye-lids; 
The eye-balls were seared with a milky mucus; 
The madness of a dying soul 
Was written on her face i 
But the multitude saw why she wore the bandage."

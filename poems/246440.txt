title : Earth Light: I

author : Lynn Xu

text : 
Doors open and shut.
We’ve come to the place where nothing shines.
I hear eternity
Is self-forgetting.  Interiors warm with the nightmare of guests and poetry
And you.  Everything darkly
Reverent years of reading about death eluded.
Bled
Back from the ear sidestepping your bullets bloom in on ye lay
Rock.  Rud.  Spread
So swiftly tastes like mud.  Dredged mud off
The corpse sled hushed down woodsmoke.
Said the stars thrum on Marie
Marie.  Hold on tight.
In the depths of outer space
Is man.

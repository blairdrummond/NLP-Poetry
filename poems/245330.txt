title : How to Judge

author : Lisa Robertson

text : 
To those whose city is taken give glass
pockets. To those whose quiver gapes give queens
 and pace their limbs with flutes, ropes, cups of soft
 juice. To those whose threshold vacillates give
 that bruise the dust astonished. To falling
 heroes give raucous sibyls’ polished knees.
 To those who sip nectar give teeth. And if
 they still sip nectar—give green chips of wood.
 To swimmers give clocks or rank their hearts
 among new satellites as you would
 Garbo’s skint lip. To scholars, give dovecotes
 to virgins, targets. Justice has nothing on them.
 Virgil, sweetheart, even pretty fops need
 justice. If they think not let creditors
 flank them and watch their vigour quickly flag.
 To exiled brides give tiny knives and beads
 of mercury then rob them of prudence
 for prudence is defunct. To those who fist
 clouds, give powder. And if their sullen
 wallets flap, give nothing at all. Still
 I have not addressed lambent fops
 swathed in honey, the stuttering moon
 Martyrs, Spartans, Sirens, Mumblers, Pawns
 Ventriloquists—or your sweet ego
  
 The Beloved Ego in the plummy light
 is you. When I see you in that light
 I desire all that has been kept from me
 etcetera. For you. Since your rough shirt
 reminds me of the first grass
 pressing my hips and seeds heads
 fringing the sky and the sky
 swaying lightly to your scraped
 breath, since I hear
 panicked, my sister calling
 since the gold leaves have all
 been lost, and you are at least
 several and variegated
 I toss this slight thread back
  
 The beloved ego on cold marble
 blurs inscription. Hey Virgil
 I think your clocked ardour is stuck
 in the blue vein on my wrist. It stops
 all judgement

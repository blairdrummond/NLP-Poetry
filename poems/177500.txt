text : 
Should they may be they might if they delight 
In why they must see it be there not only necessarily   
But which they might in which they might   
For which they might delight if they look there   
And they see there that they look there 
To see it be there which it is if it is 
Which may be where where it is 
If they do not occasion it to be different 
From what it is. 
In one direction there is the sun and the moon 
In the other direction there are cumulus clouds and the sky   
In the other direction there is why 
They look at what they see 
They look very long while they talk along 
And they may be said to see that at which they look   
Whenever there is no chance of its not being warmer   
Than if they wish which they were. 
They see that they have what is there may there   
Be there also what is to be there if they may care   
They care for it of course they care for it.   
Now only think three times roses green and blue   
And vegetables and pumpkins and pansies too 
Which they like as they are very likely not to be   
Reminded that it is more than ever necessary 
That they should never be surprised at any one time 
At just what they have been given by taking what they have   
Which they are very careful not to add with   
As they may easily indulge in the fragrance   
Not only of which but by which they know   
That they tell them so.

We wear harnesses like crossing guards. 
In a pouch over the heart, 
over stent and bypass, a black 
box with leads pressed onto metal 
nipples. We pedal and tread and row 
while our signals are picked up
by antennas on the ceiling, X’s 
like the eyes cartoonists give the dead.

Angels of telemetry with vials of nitro 
watch over us. We beam to their monitors 
now a barn dance, now a moonwalk. 
They cuff us and pump and we keep on 
so tomorrow will live off today. Nurse, 
we won’t forget the animated 
video of our cholesterol highway 
where LDL, black-hatted scowling 
donut holes on wheels, blocked traffic.

But with muscles like gutta-percha, 
can we leave time’s gurney in the dust? 
By now only the dead know more about 
gravity than we do. In reply, a tape 
of Little Richard or Jerry Lee comes on 
and we’re singing, aloud or not, all 
pale infarcted pedalers, rowers, treadmillers, 
and our hearts are rising in the east.

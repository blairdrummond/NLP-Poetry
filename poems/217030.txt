title : Box of Cigars

author : Gerald Stern

text : 
I tried one or two but they were stale 
and broke like sticks or crumbled when I rolled them 
and lighting a match was useless nor could I 
put them back in the refrigerator— 
it was too late for that—even licking them 
filled my mouth with ground-up outer leaf, 
product of Lancaster or eastern Virginia, 
so schooled I am with cigars, it comes in the blood, 
and I threw handfuls of them into the street 
from three floors up and, to my horror, sitting 
on my stoop were four or five street people 
who ran to catch them as if they were suddenly rich, 
and I apologize for that, no one should 
be degraded that way, my hands were crazy, 
and I ran down to explain but they were smoking 
already nor did I have anything to give them 
since we were living on beans ourselves, I sat 
and smoked too, and once in a while we looked 
up at the open window, and one of us spit 
into his empty can. We were visionaries.

Rhymed Stanza, Series/Sequence

The baby new to earth and sky, 
         What time his tender palm is prest 
         Against the circle of the breast, 
Has never thought that "this is I": 

But as he grows he gathers much, 
         And learns the use of "I," and "me," 
         And finds "I am not what I see, 
And other than the things I touch." 

So rounds he to a separate mind 
         From whence clear memory may begin, 
         As thro' the frame that binds him in 
His isolation grows defined. 

This use may lie in blood and breath 
         Which else were fruitless of their due, 
         Had man to learn himself anew 
Beyond the second birth of Death.

title : Before Christmas

Almost 
the first reindeer 
shipped North by boxcar from Lapland   
but a toy model 
got there first. 

A dwarf invented reindeer on his own.   
He was Santa’s favorite. He 
hadn't known 
they already existed. 

This discouraged dwarf 
was close to taking his life but 
Santa showed up 
encircled by snow. 
He said, “I will use the real reindeer for my sled 

always in yoke 
to your original invention.” 
That night the gears that turned the Pole   
stopped 
and began to turn the other way,   
so it be so. 

My love is a toy model waiting 
for a reindeer to carry me.

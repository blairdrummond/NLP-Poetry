How long will the bed that we made together
 hold us there? ﻿Your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin﻿
 from evening to dawn, a cloud of scattered
 particles now, islands of shaving foam
 slowly spiraling down the drain, blood drops
 stippling the water pink as I kiss
 the back of your neck, our faces framed inside
 a medicine cabinet mirror. The blade
 of your hand carves a portal out of steam,
 the two of us like boys behind frosted glass
 who wave goodbye while a car shoves off
 into winter. All that went unnoticed
 till now — empty cups of coffee stacked up
 in the sink, the neighborhood kids
 up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves.
 How months on a kitchen calendar drop
 like frozen flies, the flu season at its peak
 followed by a train of magic-markered
 xxx’﻿﻿﻿s — nights we’﻿﻿﻿d spend apart. Death must work
 that way, a string of long distance calls
 that only gets through to the sound of your voice
 on our machine, my heart’﻿﻿﻿s mute confession
 screened out. How long before we turn away
 from flowers altogether, your blind hand
 reaching past our bedridden shoulders
 to hit that digital alarm at delayed
 intervals — till you shut it off completely.

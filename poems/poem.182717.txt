Poems for Weddings



I should be happy with my lot: 
A wife and mother - is it not 
Enough for me to be content? 
What other blessing could be sent? 

A quiet house, and homely ways, 
That make each day like other days; 
I only see Time's shadow now 
Darken the hair on baby's brow! 

No world's work ever comes to me, 
No beggar brings his misery; 
I have no power, no healing art 
With bruised soul or broken heart. 

I read the poets of the age, 
'Tis lotus-eating in a cage; 
I study Art, but Art is dead 
To one who clamors to be fed 

With milk from Nature's rugged breast, 
Who longs for Labor's lusty rest. 
O foolish wish! I still should pine 
If nay other lot were mine.

title : A Reminiscence

author : Richard O. Moore

text : 
Held in a late season
 At a shifting of worlds,
 In the golden balance of autumn, 
 Out of love and reason
  
 We made our peace;
 Stood still in October
 In the failing light and sought,
 Each in the other, ease
  
 And release from silence,
 From the slow damnation
 Of speech that is weak
 And falls from silence.
  
 In the October sun
 By the green river we spoke,
 Late in October, the leaves 
 Of the water maples had fallen.
  
 But whatever we said
 In the bright leaves was lost,
 Quick as the leaf-fall,
 Brittle and blood red.            


                 For Kenneth Rexroth, 1950

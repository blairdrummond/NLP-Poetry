text : 
Day after day, along with his placid   
automobiles, that well-groomed    
sallow young man had been waiting for   
me, as in the cheerful, unchanging   
weather of a billboard—pacing   
the tiles, patting his tie, knotting, un-   
knotting the façade of his smile   
while staring out the window.   
He was so bad at the job   
he reminded me of myself   
the summer I failed   
at selling Time and Life in New Jersey.   
Even though I was a boy   
I could feel someone else’s voice   
crawl out of my mouth,   
spoiling every word,   
like this cowed, polite kid in his tie   
and badge that said Greg,   
saying Ma’am to my wife, calling   
me Sir, retailing the air with such piety   
I had to find anything out the window.   
Maybe the rain.  It was gray   
and as honestly wet as ever.  Something   
we could both believe.

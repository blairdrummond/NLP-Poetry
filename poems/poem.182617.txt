The lilacs lift in generous bloom 
   Their plumes of dear old-fashioned flowers; 
Their fragrance fills the still old house 
   Where left alone I count the hours. 

High in the apple-trees the bees 
   Are humming, busy in the sun,-- 
An idle robin cries for rain 
   But once or twice and then is done. 

The Sunday-morning quiet holds 
   In heavy slumber all the street, 
While from the church, just out of sight 
   Behind the elms, comes slow and sweet 

The organ's drone, the voices faint 
   That sing the quaint long-meter hymn-- 
I somehow feel as if shut out 
   From some mysterious temple, dim 

And beautiful with blue and red 
   And golden lights from windows high, 
Where angels in the shadows stand 
   And earth seems very near the sky. 

The day-dream fades--and so I try 
   Again to catch the tune that brings 
No thought of temple nor of priest, 
   But only of a voice that sings.

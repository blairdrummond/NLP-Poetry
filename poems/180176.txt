Smoketrees line the roadside, still-bare beech and poplar 
bouqueted with redbud and something rusty I can't name, 
March's odd autumnals — 
                                                                               
                                                                              One-church towns I'm glad 
not to be from, split-log strip mall with a porch 
where Claire's beauty shop shares a sign with "Antigues," where you study grace 
in magazines, and when dad dies you rename the family diner 

New York New York. Love is a means of travel, so you dye 
the linens pink and swan-fold napkins, holding peony 
in your mouth. Sundays drive out to watch the ferry 
                                                                               drag its lace. 

Coastward, Easter-colored clapboard, 
the last generation's shanties hovering on narrow stilts 
above the velour drift of tide plain (mink from a distance, 

muskrat up close), a drowsy instrumental music, 
flooded at dusk. Beside the bridge, smooth brow of pewter. 
Island of saplings blackened like a framed-up house.

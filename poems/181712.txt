title : A Shopkeeper’s Story

author : Bob Hicok

text : 
I sell one bristle brushes. People 
seeking two bristle brushes I send 
to the guy on Amsterdam, who’s in a rush. 

I may have one customer a year 
for my one bristle brushes, a one-eyed 
lover of tanagers, she may have 

one dollar to spend in the moment 
light’s neither day’s or night’s, 
but one’s where infinity begins. Whoever 

she is, she’s always painting barbules, 
I’m always thinking, no one will notice 
that they notice this, that her tanagers 

move, that everything’s alive. We talk 
care and feeding of the one 
bristle brush. Care exists. I thrive.

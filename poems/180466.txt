title : The Arkansas Prison System

author : Frank Stanford

text : 
Is like a lyric poem 
with seven basic themes 
first the cottonpicker 
dragging behind it a wagon of testicles 
a pair of pliers which can fill in 
for a cross in a pinch 
then there is the warm pond 
between the maidenâ€™s thighs 
next we have some friends 
of yours and mine 
who shall be with us always 
Pablo the artist 
the pubis of the moon 
Pablo the cellist 
panther of silence 
Pablo the poet 
the point of no return 
and in case of emergency 
the seventh and final theme 
of this systematic poem 
is the systematic way 
death undresses in front of you

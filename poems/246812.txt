title : Infinite Riches in the Smallest Room

text : 
Silk spool of the recluse as she confects her eventual mythomania. 

If it is written down, you can't rescind it. 

Spoon and pottage bowl. You are starving. Come closer now. 

What if I were gone and the wind still reeks of hyacinth, what then. 

Who will I be: a gaudy arrangement of nuclei, an apple-size gray circle 

On the tunic of a Jew, preventing more bad biological accidents

                                From breeding-in. I have not bred-

In. Each child still has one lantern inside lit. May the Mother not 

Blow her children out. She says her hair is thinning, thin. 

The flowerbed is black, sumptuous in emptiness. 

Blue-footed mushrooms line the walkway to my door. I would as soon 

Die as serve them in a salad to the man I love. We lie down 

In the shape of a gondola. Venice is gorgeous cold. 3 December, 

Unspeakable anxiety about locked-in syndrome, about a fourth world. 

I cannot presume to say. The violin spider, she 

Has six good eyes, arranged in threes.

                                The rims of wounds have wounds as well. 

Sphinx, small print, you are inscrutable.

                                                            On the roads, blue thistles, barely 

Visible by night, and, by these, you may yet find your way home.

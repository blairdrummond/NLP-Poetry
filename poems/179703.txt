title : As Children Know

Elm branches radiate green heat, 
blackbirds stiffly strut across fields. 
Beneath bedroom wood floor, I feel earth— 
bread in an oven that slowly swells, 
simmering my Navajo blanket thread-crust 
as white-feathered and corn-tasseled 
Corn Dancers rise in a line, follow my calf, 
vanish in a rumple and surface at my knee-cliff, 
chanting. Wearing shagged buffalo headgear, 
Buffalo Dancer chases Deer Woman across 
Sleeping Leg mountain. Branches of wild rose 
trees rattle seeds. Deer Woman fades into hills 
of beige background. Red Bird 
of my heart thrashes wildly after her. 
What a stupid man I have been! 
How good to let imagination go, 
step over worrisome events, 
                               those hacked logs 
                               tumbled about 
                               in the driveway. 
Let decisions go! 
                               Let them blow 
                               like school children’s papers 
                               against the fence, 
                               rattling in the afternoon wind. 
This Red Bird 
of my heart thrashes within the tidy appearance 
I offer the world, 
topples what I erect, snares what I set free, 
dashes what I’ve put together, 
indulges in things left unfinished, 
and my world is left, as children know, 
                               left as toys after dark in the sandbox.

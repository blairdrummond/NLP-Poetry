The station platform, clean and broad, his stage   
for push-ups, sit-ups, hamstring stretch,   
as he laid aside his back pack, from which   
his necessaries bulged, as he bulged   
through jeans torn at butt, knee and thigh,   
in deep palaver with himself—sigh,   
chatter, groan.  Deranged but common.   
We sat at a careful distance to spy   
on his performance, beside a woman   
in her thirties, dressed as in her teens—   
this is L.A.—singing to herself.   
How composed, complete and sane   
she seemed.  A book by the Dalai Lama   
in her hands, her face where pain and wrong   
were etched, here becalmed, with faint chirps   
leaking from the headphones of her walkman.   
Not talking.  Singing, lost in song.

title : Neighbors

author : David Allan Evans

text : 
They live alone 
together, 
    
she with her wide hind 
and bird face, 
he with his hung belly 
and crewcut. 
    
They never talk 
but keep busy. 
    
Today they are 
washing windows 
(each window together) 
she on the inside, 
he on the outside. 
He squirts Windex 
at her face, 
she squirts Windex 
at his face. 
    
Now they are waving 
to each other 
with rags, 
    
not smiling.

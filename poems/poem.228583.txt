Sonnet

No more, my dear, no more these counsels try; 
Oh, give my passions leave to run their race; 
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace; 
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry; 
Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye; 
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace; 
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case, 
But do not will me from my love to fly. 
I do not envy Aristotle's wit, 
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame; 
Nor aught do care though some above me sit; 
Nor hope nor wish another course to frame, 
But that which once may win thy cruel heart: 
Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.

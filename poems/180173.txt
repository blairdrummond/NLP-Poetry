title : Passage

I held the framework 
of my life in mind 
with some precision. 
I knew when I was 
where — or where I was 
when — but not many 
incidents of my past had 
actually been preserved. 
Instead the frame served   
as a cargo cult runway, 
forever inviting 
the future to appear. 
I existed finally 
as the idea 
of temporal extension.

The creeper   
lineates 
the wall. 

Flowers as punctuation? 

Can you elaborate   
on the passage? 

Double meaning, 

superposition: 

hair standing on end 

makes a creature appear 
larger, more ferocious.

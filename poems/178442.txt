title : Che Fece ... Il Gran Refiuto

author : C. P. Cavafy

text : 
For some people the day comes 
when they have to declare the great Yes 
or the great No. It’s clear at once who has the Yes 
ready within him; and saying it, 

he goes from honor to honor, strong in his conviction. 
He who refuses does not repent. Asked again, 
he’d still say no. Yet that no—the right no— 
drags him down all his life.

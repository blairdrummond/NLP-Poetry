Rhymed Stanza

In time and measure perfect moves 
      All Art whose aim is sure; 
Evolving rhyme and stars divine 
      Have rules, and they endure. 

Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right, 
      And, warring so, prevailed, 
In geometric beauty curved, 
      And in an orbit sailed. 

The rebel at Port Royal felt 
      The Unity overawe, 
And rued the spell. A type was here, 
      And victory of LAW.

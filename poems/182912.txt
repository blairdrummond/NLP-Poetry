title : Forever – is composed of Nows – (690)

author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
Forever – is composed of Nows – 
‘Tis not a different time – 
Except for Infiniteness – 
And Latitude of Home – 

From this – experienced Here – 
Remove the Dates – to These – 
Let Months dissolve in further Months – 
And Years – exhale in Years – 

Without Debate – or Pause – 
Or Celebrated Days – 
No different Our Years would be 
From Anno Dominies –

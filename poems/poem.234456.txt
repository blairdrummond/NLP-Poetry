Love's Witness 
Aphra Behn 
1640-1689
17th Century
England
Love, Romantic Love



Slight unpremeditated Words are borne
    By every common Wind into the Air;
Carelessly utter'd, die as soon as born,
    And in one instant give both Hope and Fear:
Breathing all Contraries with the same Wind
According to the Caprice of the Mind.

But Billetdoux are constant Witnesses,
    Substantial Records to Eternity;
Just Evidences, who the Truth confess,
    On which the Lover safely may rely;
They're serious Thoughts, digested and resolv'd;
And last, when Words are into Clouds devolv'd.

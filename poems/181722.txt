Is this happiness or oyster-life? 
This flexing of muscular torso-foot 
joy’s wonder? This sifting of silt   
from food in the shifting chill-dark? 
If, in my mind, there is a life of flight 
in the light beyond the over-swirl, 
must I unfix my lips from this rock 
to be right? Or is my apex to worry 
quartz against my shell?

title : My Sad Self

To Frank O’Hara
Sometimes when my eyes are red 
I go up on top of the RCA Building 
          and gaze at my world, Manhattan— 
                     my buildings, streets I’ve done feats in, 
                           lofts, beds, coldwater flats 
—on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind, 
          its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men 
               walking the size of specks of wool— 
   Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine, 
          sun go down over New Jersey where I was born 
             & Paterson where I played with ants— 
   my later loves on 15th Street, 
          my greater loves of Lower East Side, 
             my once fabulous amours in the Bronx   
                                        faraway— 
   paths crossing in these hidden streets, 
      my history summed up, my absences   
             and ecstasies in Harlem— 
      —sun shining down on all I own 
       in one eyeblink to the horizon 
               in my last eternity— 
                                     matter is water. 

Sad, 
      I take the elevator and go 
             down, pondering, 
and walk on the pavements staring into all man’s 
                                           plateglass, faces, 
             questioning after who loves, 
      and stop, bemused 
             in front of an automobile shopwindow 
      standing lost in calm thought, 
             traffic moving up & down 5th Avenue blocks behind me   
                      waiting for a moment when ... 

Time to go home & cook supper & listen to 
                      the romantic war news on the radio   
                                     ... all movement stops 
& I walk in the timeless sadness of existence,   
      tenderness flowing thru the buildings, 
             my fingertips touching reality’s face, 
      my own face streaked with tears in the mirror   
             of some window—at dusk— 
                                     where I have no desire— 
      for bonbons—or to own the dresses or Japanese   
                      lampshades of intellection— 

Confused by the spectacle around me, 
          Man struggling up the street 
                     with packages, newspapers, 
                                           ties, beautiful suits   
                     toward his desire 
          Man, woman, streaming over the pavements   
                     red lights clocking hurried watches &   
                            movements at the curb— 

And all these streets leading 
          so crosswise, honking, lengthily, 
                            by avenues 
          stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums 
                            thru such halting traffic 
                                           screaming cars and engines   
so painfully to this 
          countryside, this graveyard 
                     this stillness 
                                           on deathbed or mountain   
          once seen 
                            never regained or desired 
                                           in the mind to come 
where all Manhattan that I’ve seen must disappear. 


New York, October 1958

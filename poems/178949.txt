title : from On the Pulse of Morning

author : Maya Angelou

text : 
A Rock, A River, A Tree 
Hosts to species long since departed,   
Marked the mastodon, 
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens   
Of their sojourn here 
On our planet floor, 
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom   
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. 

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,   
Come, you may stand upon my 
Back and face your distant destiny, 
But seek no haven in my shadow, 
I will give you no hiding place down here. 

You, created only a little lower than 
The angels, have crouched too long in   
The bruising darkness 
Have lain too long 
Facedown in ignorance, 
Your mouths spilling words 
Armed for slaughter. 

The Rock cries out to us today,   
You may stand upon me,   
But do not hide your face.

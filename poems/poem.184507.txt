Fall, leaves, fall
Emily Bronte
1818-1848
Victorian

Nature, Winter, Fall
Poems for Weddings



Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night's decay
Ushers in a drearier day.

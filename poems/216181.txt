title : A Dog Has Died

author : Pablo Neruda

text : 
My dog has died. 
 I buried him in the garden 
 next to a rusted old machine. 

 Some day I'll join him right there, 
 but now he's gone with his shaggy coat, 
 his bad manners and his cold nose, 
 and I, the materialist, who never believed 
 in any promised heaven in the sky 
 for any human being, 
 I believe in a heaven I'll never enter. 
 Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom 
 where my dog waits for my arrival 
 waving his fan-like tail in friendship. 

 Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth, 
 of having lost a companion 
 who was never servile. 
 His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine 
 withholding its authority, 
 was the friendship of a star, aloof, 
 with no more intimacy than was called for, 
 with no exaggerations: 
 he never climbed all over my clothes 
 filling me full of his hair or his mange, 
 he never rubbed up against my knee 
 like other dogs obsessed with sex. 

 No, my dog used to gaze at me, 
 paying me the attention I need, 
 the attention required 
 to make a vain person like me understand 
 that, being a dog, he was wasting time, 
 but, with those eyes so much purer than mine, 
 he'd keep on gazing at me 
 with a look that reserved for me alone 
 all his sweet and shaggy life, 
 always near me, never troubling me, 
 and asking nothing. 

 Ai, how many times have I envied his tail 
 as we walked together on the shores of the sea 
 in the lonely winter of Isla Negra 
 where the wintering birds filled the sky 
 and my hairy dog was jumping about 
 full of the voltage of the sea's movement: 
 my wandering dog, sniffing away 
 with his golden tail held high, 
 face to face with the ocean's spray. 

 Joyful, joyful, joyful, 
 as only dogs know how to be happy 
 with only the autonomy 
 of their shameless spirit. 

 There are no good-byes for my dog who has died, 
 and we don't now and never did lie to each other. 

 So now he's gone and I buried him, 
 and that's all there is to it.

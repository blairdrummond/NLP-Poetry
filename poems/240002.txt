to be reminded
of the failing
mainspring

not sudden silence
after the extreme figure
but the relative

a grimace told
him to push the
articulation farther





the yet green used 
marks a tongues
-width to tally

a different sound
preceded every word
then took to term

to feel hips
as if new tangents
were bolting

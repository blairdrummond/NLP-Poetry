It was a picture I had after the war. 
A bombed English church. I was too young   
to know the word English or war, 
but I knew the picture. 
The ruined city still seemed noble.   
The cathedral with its roof blown off 
was not less godly. The church was the same   
plus rain and sky. Birds flew in and out   
of the holes God’s fist made in the walls.   
All our desire for love or children   
is treated like rags by the enemy. 
I knew so much and sang anyway.   
Like a bird who will sing until 
it is brought down. When they take   
away the trees, the child picks up a stick   
and says, this is a tree, this the house 
and the family. As we might. Through a door   
of what had been a house, into the field   
of rubble, walks a single lamb, tilting   
its head, curious, unafraid, hungry.

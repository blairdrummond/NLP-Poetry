title : Sex and Taxes

       Plum black & the blush white of an apple
shoulder, melon & cream, in tones to list
       the flesh; in light, washed colors off at last
& textures sheer with damp I slowly pull
       from you with your quick help. Weekend's ample
procrastinations to forget the least
       of what we want to do. April, half a blast
of cold, half new light, green & simple.
       Now dusk. Now fear. We pencil what we owe
on this short form, our numbers good enough.
       The goose-neck glare undoes how we spent the day.
Each bite each bee-sting kiss each bitten O
       all aftertaste. Later, at the drop-off,
       postmark queue, we joke: "Now we can die!"

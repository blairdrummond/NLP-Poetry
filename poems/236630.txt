title : If It Should Ever Come

author : Edward Dorn

text : 
And we are all there together
time will wave as willows do
and adios will be truly, yes,
 
      laughing at what is forgotten
and talking of what's new
admiring the roses you brought.
How sad.
 
You didn't know you were at the end
thought it was your bright pear
the earth, yes
 
another affair to have been kept
and gazed back on
when you had slept
to have been stored
as a squirrel will a nut, and half
forgotten,
there were so many, many
from the newly fallen.

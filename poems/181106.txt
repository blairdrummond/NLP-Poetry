title : Petersen: Kleichen and a Man

author : George Szirtes

text : 
I have seen eternity and it is like this, 
a man and woman dancing in a bar 
in a poor street on an unswept floor. 

It clings and plots and is desperate, 
at a point between violence and abjection, 
between warmth and agoraphobic fear. 

Let me reverse this and accept the fear. 
Let me drop all objections to abjection, 
since life itself â€‰is desperate 

and has to tread the unswept floor 
carefully, lovingly, while the bar 
hovers in eternity. Like this.

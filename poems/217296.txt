title : Thinking About the Enemy

author : Thinking About the Enemy J. P. White

text : 
In the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels 
From the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth 
Dragging along empty granary floors. Between us and them 
Stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices. 

Transfixed or transformed by this pain? We never know because 
Who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow 
Toward both the past and present? Fire, flood, famineâ€” 
All we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch 

Back and taunt us with their persistence. We track them down 
To a quick end. More come. And the old memories grow new. 
The future seems already written with a pen of iron. The book 
Unreadable, immense. The enemy has become our masterpiece.

title : Harvest of Death

(Civil War Photography by T. O’Sullivan, 1866)
Raisin-black blood dries on their faces.
 Thick wool clothes.
 Lumps of bloated bodies
 lying on their backs.
  
 Mouths open. Chins
 pointing to the sky.
 As though blown over backward.
 Or turned.
  
 Fingers swollen.
 Boots and rifles missing.
 Coats and jackets pulled up
 exposing gray shirts, bloody underwear.
  
 The sky drifts toward sap green.
 No fences. No stone walls.

title : Gaslight

author : Tom Raworth

text : 
a line of faces borders the strangler’s work
 heavy european women
 mist blows over dusty tropical plants
 lit from beneath the leaves by a spotlight
 mist in my mind a riffled deck
  
 of cards or eccentrics
 was i
 a waterton animal my head
 is not my own
  
 poetry is neither swan nor owl
 but worker, miner
 digging each generation deeper
 through the shit of its eaters
 to the root – then up to the giant tomato
  
 someone else’s song is always behind us
 as we wake from a dream trying to remember
 step onto a thumbtack
  
 two worlds – we write the skin
 the surface tension that holds
                                        you
                                        in
 what we write is ever the past
  
 curtain pulled back
 a portrait behind it
 is a room suddenly lit
  
 looking out through the eyes
 at a t.v. programme
 of a monk sealed into a coffin
  
 we close their eyes and ours
 and still here the tune
  
 moves on

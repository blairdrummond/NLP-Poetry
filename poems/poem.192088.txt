Poems for Weddings

Rhymed Stanza, Symbolist

Here, where God lives among the trees,
   Where birds and monks the whole day sing
His praises in a pleasant ease,

O heart, might we not find a home
   Here, after all our wandering?
These gates are closed, even on Rome.

Souls of the twilight wander here ; 
   Here, in the garden of that death
Which was for love's sake, need we fear

How sharp with bitter joy might be
   Love's lingering, last, longed-for breath,
Shut in upon eternity?

title : Dispatches from an Unfinished World

author : Rebecca Lindenberg

text : 
A leaf the green that a child would choose
 if asked
 to draw a leaf.
  
           *
  
 This heavy-petalled rose
 is humid as the accent
 of my current correspondent.
  
           *
  
 Trees unberried by bird.
 Trees unleafed by beetle.
  
           *
  
 My correspondent
 is a tentative man and I
 am unaccustomed to tentative men.
  
           *
  
 White rose blossom
 browning at the edges.
 Paperback book.
  
           *
  
 Inside, my mother humming
 a song I’ve never heard.
  
           *
  
 Kinds of holiness.
  
           *
  
 Trees unbarked by winter deer.
  
           *
  
 My correspondent
 will not let me love him.
  
           *
  
 Green things make 
 such mild noise.
  
           *
  
 I uncross my legs
 to find, with a bare foot,
 that sun has warmed the stone.
 I partake of the sun.
  
           *
  
 And the stone.

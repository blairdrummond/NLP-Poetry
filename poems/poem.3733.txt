Free Verse, Imagist

Why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples?   
Why do you dim yourself with folded silks? 
Do you not see that I can buy brocades in any draper's shop,   
And that I am choked in the twilight of all these colors. 
How pale you would be, and startling--   
How quiet; 
But your curves would spring upward   
Like a clear jet of flung water, 
You would quiver like a shot-up spray of water,   
You would waver, and relapse, and tremble.   
And I too should tremble, 
Watching. 

Murex-dyes and tinsel-- 
And yet I think I could bear your beauty unshaded.

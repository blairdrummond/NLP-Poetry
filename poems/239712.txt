title : Soul Story

text : 
Who is quitting dogs today? Making them their sister?
Who is stretched out by a lamppost sibling? Illuminated by ransomâ€™s note?

I was oblivious to pettiness until I saw its first handle: obey ignorance.
Stomach decisiveness. By that, this decision . . . no decision.

Let it be to gain all it can in one fetter . . . but if it be life,
let it attempt a failed recognition.

Let its thinker be the failure. My thinker is failure,
and I want to teach it how to move in this world.

Do you be or live?
To any the other wants.

To both these words, I fail to be.
When I am, but when not . . .

It is, as if alive.

title : High Tension Lines across a Landscape

author : John Ciardi

text : 
There are diagrams on stilts all wired together   
Over the hill and the wind and out of sight.   
There is a scar in the trees where they walk away   
Beyond me. There are signs of something   
Nearly God (or at least most curious) 
About them. I think those diagrams are not   
At rest. 
            I think they are a way of ciphering God:   
He is the hugest socket and all his miracles 
Are wired behind him scarring the hill and the wind   
As the waterfall flies roaring to his city 
On the open palms of the diagram. 
                                                   There is 
Shining, I suppose, in that city at night 
And measure for miracles, and wheels whirling   
So quick-silver they seem to be going backwards.   
And there’s a miracle already. But I 
Went naked through his wood of diagrams   
On a day of the rain beside me to his city. 

When I kissed that socket with my wet lip   
My teeth fell out, my fingers sprouted chives,   
And what a bald head chewed on my sick heart!

title : Poem for Haruko

author : June Jordan

text : 
I never thought I’﻿d keep a record of my pain
 or happiness
 like candles lighting the entire soft lace
 of the air
 around the full length of your hair/a shower
 organized by God
 in brown and auburn
 undulations luminous like particles
 of flame
  
 But now I do
 retrieve an afternoon of apricots
 and water interspersed with cigarettes
 and sand and rocks
 we walked across:
                         How easily you held
 my hand
 beside the low tide
 of the world
  
 Now I do
relive an evening of retreat
 a bridge I left behind
 where all the solid heat
 of lust and tender trembling 
lay as cruel and as kind 
 as passion spins its infinite
 tergiversations in between the bitter
 and the sweet
  
 Alone and longing for you
 now I do

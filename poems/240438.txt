title : Black Silk

She was cleaning—there is always
 that to do—when she found,
 at the top of the closet, his old
 silk vest. She called me
 to look at it, unrolling it carefully
 like something live
 might fall out. Then we spread it
 on the kitchen table and smoothed 
 the wrinkles down, making our hands
 heavy until its shape against Formica
 came back and the little tips
 that would have pointed to his pockets
 lay flat. The buttons were all there.
 I held my arms out and she
 looped the wide armholes over
 them. “That’s one thing I never
 wanted to be,” she said, “a man.”
 I went into the bathroom to see
 how I looked in the sheen and
 sadness. Wind chimes
 off-key in the alcove. Then her
 crying so I stood back in the sink-light
 where the porcelain had been staring. Time
 to go to her, I thought, with that
 other mind, and stood still.

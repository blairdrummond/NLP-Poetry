title : Learning to Love America

author : Shirley Geok-Lin Lim

text : 
because it has no pure products 

because the Pacific Ocean sweeps along the coastline 
because the water of the ocean is cold 
and because land is better than ocean 

because I say we rather than they 

because I live in California 
I have eaten fresh artichokes 
and jacaranda bloom in April and May 

because my senses have caught up with my body 
my breath with the air it swallows 
my hunger with my mouth 

because I walk barefoot in my house 

because I have nursed my son at my breast 
because he is a strong American boy 
because I have seen his eyes redden when he is asked who he is 
because he answers I donâ€™t know 

because to have a son is to have a country 
because my son will bury me here 
because countries are in our blood and we bleed them 

because it is late and too late to change my mind 
because it is time.

text : 
On the express train to Vienna 
she writes in her diary 
notes about Rome and Naples. 

Ink marks like parthenogenetic aphids, 
pages like blood smears 
of homing pigeons. 

She is alone, gray, reconciled, 
a Leda long after the swan's departure, 
Odysseus retired at Lotophagitis. 

Back home, in Maryland, 
the notebook will be interred 
in the archetypal drawer, 

among the yellowed love letters, 
among the infant hair curls, 
among the dried adult flowers, 

near the cushion where the castrated cat dreams 
while Mahler's forever forever forever 
chokes in the green wallpaper. 

It is her message to imagined little sons; 
it is her membership in the club 
of Swifts, Goethes, Rimbauds, Horatiuses and   
                                          deathwatch beetles. 

It is her monument outlasting bronze, 
five-dimensional reality, the last engraving 
of primeval man on reindeer bone, 

the last drop 
of the fluid soul 
before evaporation.

title : Let me tell you about my marvelous god

Let me tell you about my marvelous god, how he hides in the hexagons   
of the bees, how the drought that wrings its leather hands 
above the world is of his making, as well as the rain in the quiet minutes   
that leave only thoughts of rain. 
An atom is working and working, an atom is working in deepest   
night, then bursting like the farthest star; it is far 
smaller than a pinprick, far smaller than a zero and it has no   
will, no will toward us. 
This is why the heart has paced and paced, 
will pace and pace across the field where yarrow 
was and now is dust. A leaf catches 
in a bone. The burrow’s shut by a tumbled clod 
and the roots, upturned, are hot to the touch. 
How my god is a feathered and whirling thing; you will singe your arm   
when you pluck him from the air, 
when you pluck him from that sky 
where grieving swirls, and you will burn again 
throwing him back.

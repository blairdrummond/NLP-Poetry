text : 
Inside the standard lunch hour din they rise, four   
seamless voices fused into one, floating somewhere   
between a low hum and a vibration, like the sound   
of a train rumbling beneath noisy traffic.   
The men are hunched around a booth table,   
a fire circle of coffee cups and loose fists, leaning in   
around the thing they are summoning forth   
from inside this suddenly beating four-chambered   
heart.   I’ve taken Avery out on a whim, ordered quesadillas   
and onion rings, a kiddy milk with three straws.   
We’re already deep in the meal, extra napkins   
and wipes for the grease coating our faces   
and hands like mid-summer sweat.   And because   
we’re happy, lost in the small pleasures of father   
and son, at first their voices seem to come from inside   
us. Who’s that boy singing? Avery asks, unable   
to see these men wrapped in their act.   I let him   
keep looking, rapt.   And when no one is paying   
attention, I put down my fork and take my boy’s hand,   
and together we dive into the song.   Or maybe it pours   
into us, and we’re the ones brimming with it.

I know that He exists. (365) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Death, Living, Religion, Faith & Doubt, God & the Divine



I know that He exists. 
Somewhere - in silence - 
He has hid his rare life 
From our gross eyes. 

'Tis an instant's play - 
'Tis a fond Ambush - 
Just to make Bliss 
Earn her own surprise! 

But - should the play 
Prove piercing earnest - 
Should the glee - glaze - 
In Death's - stiff - stare - 

Would not the fun 
Look too expensive! 
Would not the jest - 
Have crawled too far!

Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

These, in the days when heaven was falling, 
 The hour when earth's foundations fled, 
 Followed their mercenary calling 
 And took their wages and are dead.


Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
 They stood, and the earth's foundations stay; 
 When God abandoned, these defended, 
 And saved the sum of things for pay.

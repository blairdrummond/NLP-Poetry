title : [marry at a hotel, annul ’em]

author : Harryette Mullen

text : 
marry at a hotel, annul ’em 
nary hep male rose sullen 
let alley roam, yell melon 
dull normal fellow hammers omelette 

divine sunrises 
Osiris’s irises 
his splendid mistress 
is his sis Isis 

creole cocoa loca 
crayon gumbo boca 
crayfish crayola 
jumbo mocha-cola 

warp maid fresh 
fetish coquettish 
a voyeur leers 
at X-rated reels

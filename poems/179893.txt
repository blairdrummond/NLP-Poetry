“I’m glad you’re positive.” 
“I’m glad you’re positive, 

too, though, of course, I wish 
you weren’t.” I wish you weren’t 

either is the response I expect, 
and you say nothing. 

And who can blame you? 
Not me. I’m not the one 

who’ll call you after dinner and a movie. 
You’re not the one who’ll call me. 

We both know we have 
that—what?—that ultimate date 

one night to come, one bright morning. 
Who can blame us? Not the forks 

and not the knives that carry on 
and do the heavy lifting now.

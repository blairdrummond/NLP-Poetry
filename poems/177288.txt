title : The circle game

The children on the lawn 
joined hand to hand 
go round and round

each arm going into
the next arm, around
full circle
until it comes
back into each of the single 
bodies again

They are singing, but
not to each other:
their feet move
almost in time to the singing

We can see
the concentration on 
their faces, their eyes 
fixed on the empty 
moving spaces just in 
front of them.

We might mistake this 
tranced moving for joy 
but there is no joy in it

We can see (arm in arm) 
as we watch them go 
round and round
intent, almost
studious (the grass
underfoot ignored, the trees 
circling the lawn
ignored, the lake ignored) 
that the whole point
for them
of going round and round 
is (faster
       slower)
going round and round

Being with you 
here, in this room

is like groping through a mirror 
whose glass has melted
to the consistency
of gelatin

You refuse to be
(and I)
an exact reflection, yet
will not walk from the glass, 
be separate.

Anyway, it is right
that they have put
so many mirrors here
(chipped, hung crooked)
in this room with its high transom 
and empty wardrobe; even
the back of the door
has one.

There are people in the next room 
arguing, opening and closing drawers 
(the walls are thin)

You look past me, listening 
to them, perhaps, or
watching
your own reflection somewhere 
behind my head,
over my shoulder

You shift, and the bed
sags under us, losing its focus

there is someone in the next room 

there is always

(your face 
remote, listening)

someone in the next room.


iii

However,
in all their games 
there seems
to be some reason

however 
abstract they 
at first appear

When we read them legends 
in the evening
of monstrous battles, and secret 
betrayals in the forest
and brutal deaths,

they scarcely listened;
one yawned and fidgeted; another 
chewed the wooden handle 
of a hammer;
the youngest one examined 
a slight cut on his toe,

and we wondered how
they could remain
completely without fear
or even interest
as the final sword slid through 
the dying hero.

The next night
walking along the beach

we found the trenches 
they had been making: 
fortified with pointed sticks 
driven into the sides 
of their sand moats

and a lake-enclosed island 
with no bridges:

a last attempt
(however
eroded by the water 
in an hour)
to make
maybe, a refuge human 
and secure from the reach

of whatever walks along 
(sword hearted) 
these night beaches.


iv

Returning to the room: 
I notice how
all your word-
plays, calculated ploys
of the body, the witticisms
of touch, are now 
attempts to keep me 
at a certain distance 
and (at length) avoid 
admitting I am here

I watch you
watching my face
indifferently
yet with the same taut curiosity 
with which you might regard 
a suddenly discovered part 
of your own body:
a wart perhaps,

and I remember that 
you said
in childhood you were 
a tracer of maps
(not making but) moving 
a pen or a forefinger
over the courses of the rivers, 
the different colours
that mark the rise of mountains; 
a memorizer
of names (to hold
these places
in their proper places)

So now you trace me
like a country’s boundary
or a strange new wrinkle in
your own wellknown skin
and I am fixed, stuck
down on the outspread map
of this room, of your mind’s continent 
            (here and yet not here, like 
            the wardrobe and the mirrors 
            the voices through the wall 
            your body ignored on the bed),

transfixed
by your eyes’
cold blue thumbtacks


v

The children like the block
of grey stone that was once a fort 
but now is a museum:

especially
they like the guns
and the armour brought from 
other times and countries
and when they go home 
their drawings will be full 
for some days, of swords 
archaic sunburst maces 
broken spears
and vivid red explosions.

While they explore 
the cannons
(they aren’t our children)

we walk outside along
the earthworks, noting
how they are crumbling
under the unceasing
attacks of feet and flower roots;

The weapons
that were once outside 
sharpening themselves on war 
are now indoors
there, in the fortress,
fragile
in glass cases;

Why is it
(I’m thinking
of the careful moulding
round the stonework archways) 
that in this time, such 
elaborate defences keep 
things that are no longer 
(much)
worth defending?


vi

And you play the safe game 
the orphan game

the ragged winter game 
that says, I am alone

(hungry: I know you want me 
to play it also)

the game of the waif who stands 
at every picture window,

shivering, pinched nose pressed 
against the glass, the snow 
collecting on his neck,
watching the happy families

(a game of envy)

Yet he despises them: they are so 
Victorian Christmas-card: 
the cheap paper shows 
under the pigments of 
their cheerful fire-
places and satin-
ribboned suburban laughter 
and they have their own forms
of parlour
games: father and mother 
playing father and mother

He’s glad 
to be left
out by himself
in the cold

(hugging himself).

When I tell you this,
you say (with a smile fake 
as a tinsel icicle):

You do it too.

Which in some ways
is a lie, but also I suppose 
is right, as usual:

although I tend to pose 
in other seasons 
outside other windows.


vii

Summer again;
in the mirrors of this room 
the children wheel, singing 
the same song;

This casual bed
scruffy as dry turf,
the counterpane
rumpled with small burrows, is 
their grassy lawn
and these scuffed walls 
contain their circling trees, 
that low clogged sink
their lake

(a wasp comes,
drawn by the piece of sandwich 
left on the nearby beach
            (how carefully you do 
            such details);
one of the children flinches 
but won’t let go)

You make them
turn and turn, according to 
the closed rules of your games, 
but there is no joy in it

and as we lie
arm in arm, neither
joined nor separate
            (your observations change me 
            to a spineless woman in 
            a cage of bones, obsolete fort 
            pulled inside out),
our lips moving
almost in time to their singing,

listening to the opening 
and closing of the drawers 
in the next room

(of course there is always 
danger but where 
would you locate it)

(the children spin
a round cage of glass 
from the warm air 
with their thread-thin 
insect voices)

and as we lie
here, caught
in the monotony of wandering 
from room to room, shifting 
the place of our defences,

I want to break
these bones, your prisoning rhythms 
            (winter,
            summer)
all the glass cases,

erase all maps,
crack the protecting 
eggshell of your turning 
singing children:

I want the circle 
broken.

Rhymed Stanza

Out upon it, I have lova??d
      Three whole days together;
And am like to love three more,
      If it prove fair weather.

Time shall moult away his wings,
      Ere he shall discover
In the whole wide world again
      Such a constant lover.

But the spite ona??t is, no praise
      Is due at all to me;
Love with me had made no stays,
      Had it any been but she.

Had it any been but she,
      And that very face,
There had been at least ere this
      A dozen dozen in her place.

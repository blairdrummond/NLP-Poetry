title : Still Burning

author : Gerald Stern

text : 
Me trying to understand say whence
 say whither, say what, say me with a pencil walking,
 say reading the dictionary, say learning medieval
 Latin, reading Spengler, reading Whitehead,
 William James I loved him, swimming breaststroke
 and thinking for an hour, how did I get here?
 Or thinking in line, say the 69 streetcar
 or 68 or 67 Swissvale,
 that would take me elsewhere, me with a textbook
 reading the pre-Socratics, so badly written,
 whoever the author was, me on the floor of
 the lighted stacks sitting cross-legged,
 walking afterwards through the park or sometimes
 running across the bridges and up the hills,
 sitting down in our tiny diningroom,
 burning in a certain way, still burning.

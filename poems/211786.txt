title : Fierce Girl Playing Hopscotch

author : Alice Fulton

text : 
You sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones. 
I am what you made to live in 
from what you had: hair matted as kelp, bad schools. 

Oh, you will never know me. I wave and you go 
on playing in the clouds 
boys clap from erasers. I am the pebble 
you tossed on the chalked space and war- 
danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air. 

In this, your future, waves rechristen the sea 
after its tiny jeweled lives 
that hiss “Us Us” to the shore all day. 
Where’s the kid called Kateydid? the moonfaced 
Kewpiedoll? The excitable pouting 
Zookie? The somber O-Be-Joyful? 

Lost girl, playing hopscotch, I will do what you could. 
Name of father, son, ghost. Cross my heart and hope. 
While the sea’s jewels build shells and shells 
change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold 
wheat grows where oceans teetered.

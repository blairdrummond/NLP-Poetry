Dear Sirs:

I have been enjoying the law and order of our 
community throughout the past three months since 
my wife and I, our two cats, and miscellaneous 
photographs of the six grandchildren belonging to 
our previous neighbors (with whom we were very 
close) arrived in Saratoga Springs which is clearly 
prospering under your custody

Indeed, until yesterday afternoon and despite my 
vigilant casting about, I have been unable to discover 
a single instance of reasons for public-spirited concern, 
much less complaint

You may easily appreciate, then, how it is that 
I write to your office, at this date, with utmost 
regret for the lamentable circumstances that force 
my hand

Speaking directly to the issue of the moment:

I have encountered a regular profusion of certain 
unidentified roses, growing to no discernible purpose, 
and according to no perceptible control, approximately 
one quarter mile west of the Northway, on the southern 
side

To be specific, there are practically thousands of 
the aforementioned abiding in perpetual near riot 
of wild behavior, indiscriminate coloring, and only 
the Good Lord Himself can say what diverse soliciting 
of promiscuous cross-fertilization

As I say, these roses, no matter what the apparent 
background, training, tropistic tendencies, age, 
or color, do not demonstrate the least inclination 
toward categorization, specified allegiance, resolute 
preference, consideration of the needs of others, or 
any other minimal traits of decency

May I point out that I did not assiduously seek out 
this colony, as it were, and that these certain 
unidentified roses remain open to viewing even by 
children, with or without suitable supervision

(My wife asks me to append a note as regards the 
seasonal but nevertheless seriously licentious 
phenomenon of honeysuckle under the moon that one may 
apprehend at the corner of Nelson and Main

However, I have recommended that she undertake direct 
correspondence with you, as regards this: yet 
another civic disturbance in our midst)

I am confident that you will devise and pursue 
appropriate legal response to the roses in question 
If I may aid your efforts in this respect, please 
do not hesitate to call me into consultation

                  Respectfully yours,

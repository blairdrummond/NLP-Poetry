title : ["The lamps are burning in the synagogue..."]

“The lamps are burning in the synagogue, 
in the houses of study, in dark alleys. . .” 
This should be the place. 
This is the way 
the guide-book describes it. Excuse me, sir, 
can you tell me 
where Eli lives, Eli the katzev— 
slaughterer of cattle and poultry? 
One of my ancestors. 
Reb Haskel? Reb Shimin? My grandfathers. 

This is the discipline that withstood the siege 
of every Jew; 
these are the prayer-shawls that have proved 
stronger than armor. 

Let us begin then humbly. Not by asking: 
Who is This you pray to? Name Him; 
define Him. For the answer is: 
we do not name Him. 
Once out of a savage fear, perhaps; 
now out of knowledge—of our ignorance. 

Begin then humbly. Not by asking: 
shall I live forever? 
Hear again the dear dead greeting me gladly 
as they used to 
when we were all among the living? 
For the answer is: 
if you think we differ from all His other creatures, 
say only if you like with the Pharisees, our teachers, 
those who do not believe in an eternal life 
will not have it. 

In the morning I arise and match again 
my plans against my cash. 
I wonder now if the long morning-prayers 
were an utter waste of an hour 
weighing, as they do, hopes and anguish, 
and sending the believer out into the street   
with the sweet taste of the prayers on his lips. 

How good to stop   
and look out upon eternity a while; 
and daily   
in the morning, afternoon, and evening 
be at ease in Zion.

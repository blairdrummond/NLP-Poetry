title : Postpartum Blues

author : Elton Glaser

text : 
Soon the glass angel must be 
Wrapped and packed and put away, 
And this hard year swept out 
Like tinsel from the Christmas tree— 
The end of December, aromatic 
In its homely smoke, and the thin limbs 
Of maple and ash, the pipecleaner pines, 
Brushing themselves against 
The cold carbons of evening. 

I've watched the ice turn 
Little knifeblades in the grass. 
Sly beneath them, the mole 
Knows what to do with dirt— 
Shoulder it aside, crumb by claw, 
And build a city deep, 
A labyrinth of dark 
Under the stone and the root. 
I think I could live there. 

I think I could make 
A music of my own. Thinking 
Makes a music of its own. 
You can hear it when 
Some stray phrase stumbles down 
The rabbit hole, a few words 
That broke from the brain 
And won't go back, always 
One step ahead of the real. 

But what's in the way 
To the way in? God, 
That desperate explanation, 
Mentor and tormentor, giving us 
The duties of paradise, 

Obligations of the saved? 
And is my way in 
This abyss of the belly, where they 
Tied the first knot in my life? 
Even the virgin must have felt 
The postpartum blues, crazy enough 
To pin sweet curls in her hair, 
Shavings she picked up from 
The floor of the carpenter's shop. 
I think I can still hear 
The baby wailing. Or is that cry 
The dead beating on their graves 
For the earth to open—

And to let them out, or to let us in?

title : Helping My Daughter Move into Her First Apartment

author : Sue Ellen Thompson

text : 
This is all I am to her now: 
a pair of legs in running shoes, 

two arms strung with braided wire. 
She heaves a carton sagging with CDs  

at me and I accept it gladly, lifting 
with my legs, not bending over, 
     
raising each foot high enough 
to clear the step. Fortunate to be  

of any use to her at all, 
I wrestle, stooped and single-handed,  

with her mattress in the stairwell, 
saying nothing as it pins me,  

sweating, to the wall. Vacuum cleaner, 
spiny cactus, five-pound sacks  

of rice and lentils slumped 
against my heart: up one flight  

of stairs and then another, 
down again with nothing in my arms.

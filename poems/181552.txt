text : 
Remember the night you got drunk 
and shot the roses? 
You were a perfect stranger, Father, 
even my bad sister cried. 

Some other gravity, 
not death or luck, 
drew fish out of the sea 
and started them panting. 

The fish became a man. 
The archer’s bow became a violin. 
I remember the night you searched the sofa 
for change 

and wept on the telephone. 
Some other gravity, 
not time or entropy, 
pulled the knife down for centuries. 

The archers dropped their bows, 
harmless as pine needles in the snow. 
The knife became a plow 
and entered the earth, Father. 

Later it became a boat 
and some other things — 
It isn’t a dream but it takes a long time, 
for the archer’s bow to become a violin.

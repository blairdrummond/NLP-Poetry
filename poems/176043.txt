       1.

In the windless late sunlight of August,
my father set fire to a globe of twine. At his back, 
the harvested acres of bluegrass and timothy
rippled. I watched from a shallow hill
as the globe, chained to the flank of his pickup truck, 
galloped and bucked down a yellow row, arced 
at the fire trench, circled back,
arced again, the flames behind
sketching first a C, then closing to Oa word 
or wreath, a flapping, slack-based heart,

gradually filling. To me at least. To the mare 
beside me, my father dragged a gleaming fence, 
some cinch-corral she might have known, 
the way the walls moved rhythmically,
in and in. And to the crows, manic
on the thermals? A crescent of their planet,

gone to sudden sun. I watched one stutter 
past the fence line, then settle
on a Hereford's tufted nape,
as if to peck some safer grain, as if
the red-cast back it rode 
contained no transformations.

A seepage, then, from the fire's edge: there 
and there, the russet flood of rabbits.
Over the sounds of burning, their haunted calls 
began, shrill and wavering, as if
their dormant voice strings
had tightened into threads of glass.

In an instant they were gonethe rabbits, 
their voicesover the fire trench,
into the fallows. My father walked
near the burn line, waved up to me, and from 
that wave, or the rippled film of heat,

I remembered our porch in an August wind, 
how he stepped through the weathered doorway, 
his hand outstretched with some
book-pressed flower, orchid or lily, withered 
to a parchment brown. Here, he said, but 
as he spoke it atomized before us
pulp and stem, the pollened tongue, 
dreadful in the dancing air.

Scummed and boxcar thin,
six glass-walled houses stretched beside our fields. 
Inside them, lilies, lilies

a thousand shades of white, I think. 
Eggshell, oyster, parchment, flax.

Far down the black-mulched beds, they seemed 
ancestral to me, the fluted heads of
dowagers, their meaty, groping,
silent tongues. They seemed
to form perspective's chain:
cinder, bone, divinity. . .

My father waved. The crows set down. 
By evening, our fields took the texture 
of freshened clay, a sleek
and water-bloated sheen, although no water 
rested therejust heat and ash
united in a slick mirage. I crossed the fence line, 
circled closer, the grasses all around me
collapsing into tufts of smoke. Then as I bent
I saw the shapes, rows and rows of tougher stems

brittle, black, metallic wisps, like something grown 
to echo grass. The soot was warm,
the sky held smoke in a jaundiced wing,
and as a breeze crossed slowly through,
stems glowedthen ebbed
consecutively. And so revealed a kind of path, 
and then a kind of journey.

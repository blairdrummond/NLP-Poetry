title : Two Guitars

author : Victor Hernández Cruz

Two guitars were left in a room all alone 
They sat on different corners of the parlor 
In this solitude they started talking to each other 
My strings are tight and full of tears 
The man who plays me has no heart 
I have seen it leave out of his mouth 
I have seen it melt out of his eyes 
It dives into the pores of the earth 
When they squeeze me tight I bring 
Down the angels who live off the chorus 
The trios singing loosen organs 
With melodious screwdrivers 
Sentiment comes off the hinges 
Because a song is a mountain put into 
Words and landscape is the feeling that 
Enters something so big in the harmony 
We are always in danger of blowing up 
With passion 
The other guitar: 
In 1944 New York 
When the Trio Los Panchos started 
With Mexican & Puerto Rican birds 
I am the one that one of them held 
Tight    like a woman 
Their throats gardenia gardens 
An airport for dreams 
I've been in theaters and cabarets 
I played in an apartment on 102nd street 
After a baptism pregnant with women 
The men flirted and were offered 
Chicken soup 
Echoes came out of hallways as if from caves 
Someone is opening the door now 
The two guitars hushed and there was a 
Resonance in the air like what is left by 
The last chord of a bolero.

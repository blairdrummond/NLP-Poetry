Rhymed Stanza

Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair,
      And gaze upon her smile;
Seem as you drank the very air
      Her breath perfumed the while:

And wake for her the gifted line,
      That wild and witching lay,
And swear your heart is as a shrine,
      That only owns her sway.

'Tis well: I am revenged at last,--
      Mark you that scornful cheek,--
The eye averted as you pass'd,
      Spoke more than words could speak.

Ay, now by all the bitter tears
      That I have shed for thee,--
The racking doubts, the burning fears,--
      Avenged they well may be--

By the nights pass'd in sleepless care,
      The days of endless woe;
All that you taught my heart to bear,
      All that yourself will know.

I would not wish to see you laid
      Within an early tomb;
I should forget how you betray'd,
      And only weep your doom:

But this is fitting punishment,
      To live and love in vain,--
Oh my wrung heart, be thou content,
      And feed upon his pain.

Go thou and watch her lightest sigh,--
      Thine own it will not be;
And bask beneath her sunny eye,--
      It will not turn on thee.

'Tis well: the rack, the chain, the wheel,
      Far better hadst thou proved;
Ev'n I could almost pity feel,
      For thou art nor beloved.

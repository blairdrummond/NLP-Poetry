Refrain, Metaphor

munching a plum on   
the street a paper bag 
of them in her hand 

They taste good to her 
They taste good   
to her. They taste 
good to her 

You can see it by 
the way she gives herself 
to the one half 
sucked out in her hand 

ComfortedComforted When originally published in the journal Smoke (Autumn 1934), the line read: "Comforted, Relieved--" 
a solace of ripe plums 
seeming to fill the air 
They taste good to her

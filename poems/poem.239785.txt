Metaphor, Refrain, Rhymed Stanza

Over the edge of the purple down,
    Where the single lamplight gleams,
 Know ye the road to the Merciful Town
    That is hard by the Sea of Dreams - 
 Where the poor may lay their wrongs away,
    And the sick may forget to weep?
 But we - pity us! Oh, pity us!
    We wakeful; ah, pity us! -
 We must go back with Policeman Day - 
    Back from the City of Sleep!
  
 Weary they turn from the scroll and crown,
    Fetter and prayer and plough - 
 They that go up to the Merciful Town,
    For her gates are closing now.
 It is their right in the Baths of Night
    Body and soul to steep,
 But we - pity us! ah, pity us!
    We wakeful; oh, pity us! -
 We must go back with Policeman Day -
    Back from the City of Sleep!
  
 Over the edge of the purple down,
    Ere the tender dreams begin,
 Look - we may look - at the Merciful Town,
    But we may not enter in!
 Outcasts all, from her guarded wall
    Back to our watch we creep:
 We - pity us! ah, pity us!
    We wakeful; ah, pity us! -
 We that go back with Policeman Day -
    Back from the City of Sleep!

A Ring Presented to Julia 
Robert Herrick 
1591-1674

England
Love, Romantic Love



   Julia, I bring
   To thee this ring,
Made for thy finger fit;
   To show by this
   That our love is
(Or should be) like to it.

   Close though it be,
   The joint is free;
So when Love's yoke is on,
   It must not gall,
   Or fret at all
With hard oppression.

   But it must play
   Still either way,
And be, too, such a yoke
   As not too wide
   To overslide,
Or be so strait to choke.

   So we who bear
   This beam must rear
Ourselves to such a height
   As that the stay
   Of either may
Create the burden light.

   And as this round
   Is nowhere found
To flaw, or else to sever;
   So let our love
   As endless prove,
And pure as gold for ever.

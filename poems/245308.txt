title : It Was Alive, Though Differently

author : Hannah Gamble

text : 
It had a secret name
 which in later years came to mean
 I will continue to stand here.
  
 It had a food mouth
 and a shrieking mouth.
  
 Popular wisdom indicated
 that Its hands could heat stones
 and that a man could cook
 meat on those stones.
  
 That being said,
 It had a poverty hand
 and a riches hand.
  
 They were
 the same hand.
  
 A little ways above the hands
 the mouths spoke together
 but for two
 different reasons,
 like the music was behaving
 but the orchestra was broken.
  
 *
  
 Even in less
 benevolent moments,
 It was known to use Its own
body as a tent and as the gifts
 inside of the tent.
  
 Early people said It had a mother hand
 and a father hand, and that together
 they made a clapping sound.
  
 Its hands delivered the children
 from madness.
  
 The hands saw the riverbank sliding
 into the river
 to make
 a more shallow river.
  
 They scooped the mud up.
 The hands were giving thanks.
  
 *
  
 The hands smelled like exodus.
 The hands were the law.
  
 One hand grew older, and the other
 hand younger.
  
 They said, fairly often,
 We’d like to try that again.
  
 Both were restless
 and wanted rest.
  
 One hand said, I will go where you go,
 while the other hand continued
 on alone.

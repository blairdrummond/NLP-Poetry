PErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad success 
The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, 
Discover'd in his fraud, thrown from his hope, 
So oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric 
That sleek't his tongue, and won so much on Eve, 
So little here, nay lost; but Eve was Eve, 
This far his over-match, who self deceiv'd 
And rash, before-hand had no better weigh'd 
The strength he was to cope with, or his own: 
But as a man who had been matchless held 
In cunning, over-reach't where least he thought, 
To salve his credit, and for very spight 
Still will be tempting him who foyls him still, 
And never cease, though to his shame the more; 
Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time, 
About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr'd, 
Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; 
Or surging waves against a solid rock, 
Though all to shivers dash't, the assault renew, 
Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end; 
So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse 
Met ever; and to shameful silence brought, 
Yet gives not o're though desperate of success, 
And his vain importunity pursues. 
He brought our Saviour to the western side 
Of that high mountain, whence he might behold 
Another plain, long but in bredth not wide; 
Wash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the North 
To equal length back'd with a ridge of hills 
That screen'd the fruits of the earth and seats of men 
From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the midst 
Divided by a river, of whose banks 
On each side an Imperial City stood, 
With Towers and Temples proudly elevate 
On seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn'd, 
Porches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts, 
Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs, 
Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes, 
Above the highth of Mountains interpos'd. 
By what strange Parallax or Optic skill 
Of vision multiplyed through air, or glass 
Of Telescope, were curious to enquire: 
And now the Tempter thus his silence broke. 
   The City which thou seest no other deem 
Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth 
So far renown'd, and with the spoils enricht 
Of Nations; there the Capitol thou seest 
Above the rest lifting his stately head 
On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel 
Impregnable, and there Mount Palatine 
The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and high 
The Structure, skill of noblest Architects, 
With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, 
Turrets and Terrases, and glittering Spires. 
Many a fair Edifice besides, more like 
Houses of Gods (so well I have dispos'd 
My Aerie Microscope) thou may'st behold 
Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs 
Carv'd work, the hand of fam'd Artificers 
In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or Gold. 
Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see 
What conflux issuing forth, or entring in, 
Pretors, Proconsuls to thir Provinces 
Hasting or on return, in robes of State; 
Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power, 
Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and wings: 
Or Embassies from Regions far remote 
In various habits on the Appian road, 
Or on the Æmilian, some from farthest South, 
Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, 
Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to West, 
The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea; 
From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these, 
From India and the golden Chersoness, 
And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, 
Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreath'd: 
From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish West, 
Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians North 
Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool. 
All Nations now to Rome obedience pay, 
To Rome's great Emperour, whose wide domain 
In ample Territory, wealth and power, 
Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms, 
And long Renown thou justly may'st prefer 
Before the Parthian; these two Thrones except, 
The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, 
Shar'd among petty Kings too far remov'd; 
These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all 
The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory. 
This Emperour hath no Son, and now is old, 
Old, and lascivious, and from Rome retir'd 
To Capreæ an Island small but strong 
On the Campanian shore, with purpose there 
His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, 
Committing to a wicked Favourite 
All publick cares, and yet of him suspicious, 
Hated of all, and hating; with what ease 
Indu'd with Regal Vertues as thou art, 
Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, 
Might'st thou expel this monster from his Throne 
Now made a stye, and in his place ascending 
A victor, people free from servile yoke? 
And with my help thou may'st; to me the power 
Is given, and by that right I give it thee. 
Aim therefore at no less then all the world, 
Aim at the highest, without the highest attain'd 
Will be for thee no sitting, or not long 
On David's Throne, be propheci'd what will. 
   To whom the Son of God unmov'd reply'd. 
Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show 
Of luxury, though call'd magnificence, 
More then of arms before, allure mine eye, 
Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell 
Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts 
On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone; 
(For I have also heard, perhaps have read) 
Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, 
Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in Gold, 
Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss'd with Gems 
And studs of Pearl, to me should'st tell who thirst 
And hunger still: then Embassies thou shew'st 
From Nations far and nigh; what honour that, 
But tedious wast of time to sit and hear 
So many hollow complements and lies, 
Outlandish flatteries? then proceed'st to talk 
Of the Emperour, how easily subdu'd, 
How gloriously; I shall, thou say'st, expel 
A brutish monster: what if I withal 
Expel a Devil who first made him such? 
Let his tormenter Conscience find him out, 
For him I was not sent, nor yet to free 
That people victor once, now vile and base, 
Deservedly made vassal, who once just, 
Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer'd well, 
But govern ill the Nations under yoke, 
Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted all 
By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown 
Of triumph that insulting vanity; 
Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur'd 
Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos'd, 
Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still, 
And from the daily Scene effeminate. 
What wise and valiant man would seek to free 
These thus degenerate, by themselves enslav'd, 
Or could of inward slaves make outward free? 
Know therefore when my season comes to sit 
On David's Throne, it shall be like a tree 
Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth, 
Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash 
All Monarchies besides throughout the world, 
And of my Kingdom there shall be no end: 
Means there shall be to this, but what the means, 
Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell. 
   To whom the Tempter impudent repli'd. 
I see all offers made by me how slight 
Thou valu'st, because offer'd, and reject'st: 
Nothing will please the difficult and nice, 
Or nothing more then still to contradict: 
On the other side know also thou, that I 
On what I offer set as high esteem, 
Nor what I part with mean to give for naught; 
All these which in a moment thou behold'st, 
The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give; 
For giv'n to me, I give to whom I please, 
No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else, 
On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, 
And worship me as thy superior Lord, 
Easily done, and hold them all of me; 
For what can less so great a gift deserve? 
   Whom thus our Saviour answer'd with disdain. 
I never lik'd thy talk, thy offers less, 
Now both abhor, since thou hast dar'd to utter 
The abominable terms, impious condition; 
But I endure the time, till which expir'd, 
Thou hast permission on me.   It is written 
The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship 
The Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve; 
And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound 
To worship thee accurst, now more accurst 
For this attempt bolder then that on Eve, 
And more blasphemous? which expect to rue. 
The Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv'n, 
Permitted rather, and by thee usurp't, 
Other donation none thou canst produce: 
If given, by whom but by the King of Kings, 
God over all supreme? if giv'n to thee, 
By thee how fairly is the Giver now 
Repaid?   But gratitude in thee is lost 
Long since.   Wert thou so void of fear or shame, 
As offer them to me the Son of God, 
To me my own, on such abhorred pact, 
That I fall down and worship thee as God? 
Get thee behind me; plain thou now appear'st 
That Evil one, Satan for ever damn'd. 
   To whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply'd. 
Be not so sore offended, Son of God; 
Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men, 
If I to try whether in higher sort 
Then these thou bear'st that title, have propos'd 
What both from Men and Angels I receive, 
Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth 
Nations besides from all the quarter'd winds, 
God of this world invok't and world beneath; 
Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold 
To me so fatal, me it most concerns. 
The tryal hath indamag'd thee no way, 
Rather more honour left and more esteem; 
Me naught advantag'd, missing what I aim'd. 
Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, 
The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more 
Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not. 
And thou thy self seem'st otherwise inclin'd 
Then to a worldly Crown, addicted more 
To contemplation and profound dispute, 
As by that early action may be judg'd, 
When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went'st 
Alone into the Temple; there was found 
Among the gravest Rabbies disputant 
On points and questions fitting Moses Chair, 
Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, 
As morning shews the day.   Be famous then 
By wisdom; as thy Empire must extend, 
So let extend thy mind o're all the world, 
In knowledge, all things in it comprehend, 
All knowledge is not couch't in Moses Law, 
The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote, 
The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach 
To admiration, led by Natures light; 
And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, 
Ruling them by perswasion as thou mean'st, 
Without thir learning how wilt thou with them, 
Or they with thee hold conversation meet? 
How wilt thou reason with them, how refute 
Thir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes? 
Error by his own arms is best evinc't. 
Look once more e're we leave this specular Mount 
Westward, much nearer by Southwest, behold 
Where on the Ægean shore a City stands 
Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil, 
Athens the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts 
And Eloquence, native to famous wits 
Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, 
City or Suburban, studious walks and shades; 
See there the Olive Grove of Academe, 
Plato's retirement, where the Attic Bird 
Trills her thick-warbl'd notes the summer long, 
There flowrie hill Hymettus with the sound 
Of Bees industrious murmur oft invites 
To studious musing; there Ilissus rouls 
His whispering stream; within the walls then view 
The schools of antient Sages; his who bred 
Great Alexander to subdue the world, 
Lyceum there, and painted Stoa next: 
There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power 
Of harmony in tones and numbers hit 
By voice or hand, and various-measur'd verse, 
Æolian charms and Dorian Lyric Odes, 
And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, 
Blind Melesigenes thence Homer call'd, 
Whose Poem Phoebus challeng'd for his own. 
Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians taught 
In Chorus or Iambic, teachers best 
Of moral prudence, with delight receiv'd 
In brief sententious precepts, while they treat 
Of fate, and chance, and change in human life; 
High actions, and high passions best describing: 
Thence to the famous Orators repair, 
Those antient, whose resistless eloquence 
Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, 
Shook the Arsenal and fulmin'd over Greece, 
To Macedon, and Artaxerxes Throne; 
To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, 
From Heaven descended to the low-rooft house 
Of Socrates, see there his Tenement, 
Whom well inspir'd the Oracle pronounc'd 
Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu'd forth 
Mellifluous streams that water'd all the schools 
Of Academics old and new, with those 
Sirnam'd Peripatetics, and the Sect 
Epicurean, and the Stoic severe; 
These here revolve, or, as thou lik'st, at home, 
Till time mature thee to a Kingdom's waight; 
These rules will render thee a King compleat 
Within thy self, much more with Empire joyn'd. 
   To whom our Saviour sagely thus repli'd. 
Think not but that I know these things, or think 
I know them not; not therefore am I short 
Of knowing what I aught: he who receives 
Light from above, from the fountain of light, 
No other doctrine needs, though granted true; 
But these are false, or little else but dreams, 
Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. 
The first and wisest of them all profess'd 
To know this only, that he nothing knew; 
The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits, 
A third sort doubted all things, though plain sence; 
Others in vertue plac'd felicity, 
But vertue joyn'd with riches and long life, 
In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease, 
The Stoic last in Philosophic pride, 
By him call'd vertue; and his vertuous man, 
Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing 
Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, 
As fearing God nor man, contemning all 
Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life, 
Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can, 
For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, 
Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. 
Alas what can they teach, and not mislead; 
Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, 
And how the world began, and how man fell 
Degraded by himself, on grace depending? 
Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, 
And in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves 
All glory arrogate, to God give none, 
Rather accuse him under usual names, 
Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite 
Of mortal things.   Who therefore seeks in these 
True wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion 
Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, 
An empty cloud.   However many books 
Wise men have said are wearisom; who reads 
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not 
A spirit and judgment equal or superior, 
(And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek) 
Uncertain and unsettl'd still remains, 
Deep verst in books and shallow in himself, 
Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys, 
And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; 
As Children gathering pibles on the shore. 
Or if I would delight my private hours 
With Music or with Poem, where so soon 
As in our native Language can I find 
That solace?   All our Law and Story strew'd 
With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib'd, 
Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, 
That pleas'd so well our Victors ear, declare 
That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv'd; 
Ill imitated, while they loudest sing 
The vices of thir Deities, and thir own 
In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating 
Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. 
Remove their swelling Epithetes thick laid 
As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the rest, 
Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, 
Will far be found unworthy to compare 
With Sion's songs, to all true tasts excelling, 
Where God is prais'd aright, and Godlike men, 
The Holiest of Holies, and his Saints; 
Such are from God inspir'd, not such from thee; 
Unless where moral vertue is express't 
By light of Nature not in all quite lost. 
Thir Orators thou then extoll'st, as those 
The top of Eloquence, Statists indeed, 
And lovers of thir Country, as may seem; 
But herein to our Prophets far beneath, 
As men divinely taught, and better teaching 
The solid rules of Civil Government 
In thir majestic unaffected stile 
Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome. 
In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, 
What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so, 
What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities flat; 
These only with our Law best form a King. 
   So spake the Son of God; but Satan now 
Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, 
Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply'd. 
   Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, 
Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught 
By me propos'd in life contemplative, 
Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, 
What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness 
For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, 
And thither will return thee, yet remember 
What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause 
To wish thou never hadst rejected thus 
Nicely or cautiously my offer'd aid, 
Which would have set thee in short time with ease 
On David's Throne; or Throne of all the world, 
Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, 
When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill'd. 
Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, 
Or Heav'n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars 
Voluminous, or single characters, 
In their conjunction met, give me to spell, 
Sorrows, and labours, opposition, hate, 
Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, 
Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, 
A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, 
Real or Allegoric I discern not, 
Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, 
Without beginning; for no date prefixt 
Directs me in the Starry Rubric set. 
   So saying he took (for still he knew his power 
Not yet expir'd) and to the Wilderness 
Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, 
Feigning to disappear.   Darkness now rose, 
As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night 
Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, 
Privation meer of light and absent day. 
Our Saviour meek and with untroubl'd mind 
After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, 
Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, 
Wherever, under some concourse of shades 
Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield 
From dews and damps of night his shelter'd head, 
But shelter'd slept in vain, for at his head 
The Tempter watch'd, and soon with ugly dreams 
Disturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic now 
Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the Clouds 
From many a horrid rift abortive pour'd 
Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire 
In ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the winds 
Within thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad 
From the four hinges of the world, and fell 
On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, 
Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks 
Bow'd their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, 
Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, 
O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst 
Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, 
Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round 
Environ'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd, 
Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou 
Sat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless peace. 
Thus pass'd the night so foul till morning fair 
Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; 
Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar 
Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds, 
And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais'd 
To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. 
And now the Sun with more effectual beams 
Had chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the wet 
From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds 
Who all things now behold more fresh and green, 
After a night of storm so ruinous, 
Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray 
To gratulate the sweet return of morn; 
Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn 
Was absent, after all his mischief done, 
The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem 
Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, 
Yet with no new device, they all were spent, 
Rather by this his last affront resolv'd, 
Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, 
And mad despight to be so oft repell'd. 
Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, 
Back'd on the North and West by a thick wood, 
Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; 
And in a careless mood thus to him said. 
   Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, 
After a dismal night; I heard the rack 
As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self 
Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them 
As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, 
Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, 
Are to the main as inconsiderable, 
And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze 
To mans less universe, and soon are gone; 
Yet as being oft times noxious where they light 
On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, 
Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, 
Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, 
They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: 
This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; 
Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. 
Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject 
The perfet season offer'd with my aid 
To win thy destin'd seat, but wilt prolong 
All to the push of Fate, persue thy way 
Of gaining David's Throne no man knows when, 
For both the when and how is no where told, 
Thou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no doubt; 
For Angels have proclaim'd it, but concealing 
The time and means: each act is rightliest done, 
Not when it must, but when it may be best. 
If thou observe not this, be sure to find, 
What I foretold thee, many a hard assay 
Of dangers, and adversities and pains, 
E're thou of Israel's Scepter get fast hold; 
Whereof this ominous night that clos'd thee round, 
So many terrors, voices, prodigies 
May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign. 
   So talk'd he, while the Son of God went on 
And staid not, but in brief him answer'd thus. 
   Mee worse then wet thou find'st not; other harm 
Those terrors which thou speak'st of, did me none; 
I never fear'd they could, though noising loud 
And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs 
Betok'ning, or ill boding, I contemn 
As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; 
Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing, 
Obtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I accepting 
At least might seem to hold all power of thee, 
Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, 
And storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie 
Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern'd 
And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest. 
   To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd: 
Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; 
For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, 
Of the Messiah I have heard foretold 
By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length 
Announc't by Gabriel with the first I knew, 
And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, 
On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. 
From that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye 
Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, 
Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; 
Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all 
Flock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest, 
Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n 
Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd. 
Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view 
And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn 
In what degree or meaning thou art call'd 
The Son of God, which bears no single sence; 
The Son of God I also am, or was, 
And if I was, I am; relation stands; 
All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought 
In some respect far higher so declar'd. 
Therefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that hour, 
And follow'd thee still on to this wast wild; 
Where by all best conjectures I collect 
Thou art to be my fatal enemy. 
Good reason then, if I before-hand seek 
To understand my Adversary, who 
And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, 
By parl, or composition, truce, or league 
To win him, or win from him what I can. 
And opportunity I here have had 
To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee 
Proof against all temptation as a rock 
Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm 
To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, 
Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory 
Have been before contemn'd, and may agen: 
Therefore to know what more thou art then man, 
Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav'n, 
Another method I must now begin. 
   So saying he caught him up, and without wing 
Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime 
Over the Wilderness and o're the Plain; 
Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, 
The holy City lifted high her Towers, 
And higher yet the glorious Temple rear'd 
Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount 
Of Alabaster, top't with Golden Spires: 
There on the highest Pinacle he set 
The Son of God; and added thus in scorn: 
   There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright 
Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house 
Have brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is best, 
Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, 
Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: 
For it is written, He will give command 
Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands 
They shall up lift thee, lest at any time 
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone. 
   To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, 
Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. 
But Satan smitten with amazement fell 
As when Earths Son Antæus (to compare 
Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove 
With Joves Alcides, and oft foil'd still rose, 
Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, 
Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd, 
Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell; 
So after many a foil the Tempter proud, 
Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride 
Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. 
And as that Theban Monster that propos'd 
Her riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, devour'd; 
That once found out and solv'd, for grief and spight 
Cast her self headlong from th' Ismenian steep, 
So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, 
And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought 
Joyless triumphals of his hop't success, 
Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, 
Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. 
So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe 
Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, 
Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft 
From his uneasie station, and upbore 
As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, 
Then in a flowry valley set him down 
On a green bank, and set before him spred 
A table of Celestial Food, Divine, 
Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, 
And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, 
That soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd 
What hunger, if aught hunger had impair'd, 
Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires 
Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory 
Over temptation, and the Tempter proud. 
   True Image of the Father whether thron'd 
In the bosom of bliss, and light of light 
Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd 
In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, 
Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, 
Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing 
The Son of God, with Godlike force indu'd 
Against th' Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, 
And Thief of Paradise; him long of old 
Thou didst debel, and down from Heav'n cast 
With all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd 
Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing 
Temptation, hast regain'd lost Paradise, 
And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: 
He never more henceforth will dare set foot 
In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: 
For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail'd, 
A fairer Paradise is founded now 
For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou 
A Saviour art come down to re-install. 
Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be 
Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. 
But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long 
Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star 
Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav'n trod down 
Under his feet: for proof, e're this thou feel'st 
Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound 
By this repulse receiv'd, and hold'st in Hell 
No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues 
Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe 
To dread the Son of God: he all unarm'd 
Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice 
From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, 
Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, 
And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, 
Lest he command them down into the deep 
Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. 
Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, 
Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work 
Now enter, and begin to save mankind. 
   Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek 
Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht 
Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv'd 
Home to his Mothers house private return'd.

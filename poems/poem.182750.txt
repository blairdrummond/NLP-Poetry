I am thy grass, O Lord! 
    I grow up sweet and tall 
But for a day; beneath Thy sword 
    To lie at evenfall. 

Yet have I not enough 
    In that brief day of mine? 
The wind, the bees, the wholesome stuff 
    The sun pours out like wine. 

Behold, this is my crown; 
    Love will not let me be; 
Love holds me here; Love cuts me down; 
    And it is well with me. 

Lord, Love, keep it but so; 
    Thy purpose is full plain; 
I die that after I may grow 
    As tall, as sweet again.

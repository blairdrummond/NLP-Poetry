Rhymed Stanza, Dramatic Monologue

Lie down--lie down!--my noble hound, 
         That joyful bark give o'er; 
It wakes the lonely echoes round, 
         But rouses me no more-- 
Thy lifted ears, thy swelling chest, 
         Thy eyes so keenly bright, 
No longer kindle in my breast 
         The thrill of fierce delight; 
When following thee on foaming steed 
My eager soul outstripped thy speed-- 

Lie down--lie down--my faithful hound! 
         And watch this night by me, 
For thee again the horn shall sound 
         By mountain, stream, and tree; 
And thou along the forest glade, 
         Shall track the flying deer 
When cold and silent, I am laid 
         In chill oblivion here. 
Another voice shall cheer thee on, 
And glory when the chase is won. 

Lie down--lie down!--my gallant hound! 
         Thy master's life is sped; 
Go--couch thee on the dewy ground-- 
         'Tis thine to watch the dead. 
But when the blush of early day 
         Is kindling up the sky, 
Then speed thee, faithful friend, away, 
         And to thy mistress hie; 
And guide her to this lonely spot, 
Though my closed eyes behold her not-- 

Lie down--lie down!--my trusty hound! 
         Death comes, and we must part-- 
In my dull ear strange murmurs sound-- 
         More faintly throbs my heart; 
The many twinkling lights of heaven 
         Scarce glimmer in the blue-- 
Chill round me falls the breath of even, 
         Cold on my brow the dew; 
Earth, stars, and heavens, are lost to sight-- 
The chase is o'er!--brave friend, good night!--

title : The Bachelor’s Soliloquy

author : Edgar Albert Guest

text : 
To wed, or not to wed; that is the question; 
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The bills and house rent of a wedded fortune, 
Or to say “nit” when she proposes, 
And by declining cut her. To wed; to smoke 
No more; And have a wife at home to mend 
The holes in socks and shirts 
And underwear and so forth. ’Tis a consummation 
Devoutly to be wished. To wed for life; 
To wed; perchance to fight; ay, there’s the rub; 
For in that married life what fights may come, 
When we have honeymooning ceased 
Must give us pause; there’s the respect 
That makes the joy of single life. 
For who would bear her mother’s scornful tongue, 
Canned goods for tea, the dying furnace fire; 
The pangs of sleepless nights when baby cries; 
The pain of barking shins upon a chair and 
Closing waists that button down the back, 
When he himself might all these troubles shirk 
With a bare refusal? Who would bundles bear, 
And grunt and sweat under a shopping load? 
Who would samples match; buy rats for hair, 
Cart cheese and crackers home to serve at night 
For lunch to feed your friends; play pedro 
After tea; sing rag time songs, amusing 
Friendly neighbors. Buy garden tools 
To lend unto the same. Stay home at nights 
In smoking coat and slippers and slink to bed 
At ten o’clock to save the light bills? 
Thus duty does make cowards of us all, 
And thus the native hue of matrimony 
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of chores; 
And thus the gloss of marriage fades away, 
And loses its attraction.

title : The Boundary

author : Bei Dao

text : 
I want to go to the other bank 

The river water alters the sky's colour 
and alters me 
I am in the current 
my shadow stands by the river bank 
like a tree struck by lightning 

I want to go to the other bank 

In the trees on the other bank 
a solitary startled wood pigeon 
flies towards me

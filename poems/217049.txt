title : Market Forecast

author : Alexa Selph

text : 
Adjectives continue 
their downward spiral, 
with adverbs likely to follow. 

Wisdom, grace, and beauty 
can be had three for a dollar, 
as they head for a recession. 

Diaphanous, filigree, 
pearlescent, and love 
are now available 
at wholesale prices. 

Verbs are still blue-chip investments, 
but not many are willing to sell. 

The image market is still strong, 
but only for those rated AA or higher. 
Beware of cheap imitations 
sold by the side of the road. 

Only the most conservative 
consider rhyme a good option, 
but its success in certain circles 
warrants a brief mention. 

The ongoing search for fresh 
metaphor has caused concern 
among environmental activists, 

who warn that both the moon and the sea 
have measurably diminished 
since the dawn of the Romantic era. 

Latter-day prosodists are having to settle 
for menial positions in poultry plants, 
where an aptitude for repetitive rhythms 
is considered a valuable trait. 

The outlook for the future remains uncertain, 
and troubled times may lie ahead. 
Supply will continue to outpace demand, 
and the best of the lot will remain unread.

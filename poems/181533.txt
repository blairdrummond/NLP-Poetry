title : The River

author : Gregory Orr

text : 
I felt both pleasure and a shiver 
as we undressed on the slippery bank 
and then plunged into the wild river. 

I waded in; she entered as a diver. 
Watching her pale flanks slice the dark 
I felt both pleasure and a shiver. 

Was this a source of the lake we sought, giver 
of itself to that vast, blue expanse? 
We’d learn by plunging into the wild river 

and letting the current take us wherever 
it willed. I had that yielding to thank 
for how I felt both pleasure and a shiver. 

But what she felt and saw I’ll never 
know: separate bodies taking the same risk 
by plunging together into the wild river. 

Later, past the rapids, we paused to consider 
if chance or destiny had brought us here; 
whether it was more than pleasure and a shiver 
we’d found by plunging into the wild river.

title : Poem for My Love

author : June Jordan

text : 
How do we come to be here next to each other   
in the night 
Where are the stars that show us to our love   
inevitable 
Outside the leaves flame usual in darkness   
and the rain 
falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh   
the black men waiting on the corner for   
a womanly mirage 
I am amazed by peace 
It is this possibility of you 
asleep 
and breathing in the quiet air

all 
wrong 
            And I am asked—ask myself (I, too, covered   
with the gurry of it) where 
shall we go from here, what can we do 
when even the public conveyances 
sing? 
          how can we go anywhere, 
even cross-town 
                         how get out of anywhere (the bodies   
all buried 
in shallow graves?

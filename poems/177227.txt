Beards of   water 
                      some of them have. 
         Others are blowing whistles of   water. 
         Faces astonished that constant   water 
                  jumps from their mouths. 
                   Jaws of lions are snarling   water 
through green teeth over chins of moss. 
                              Dolphins toss jets of   water 
                                    from open snouts 
                              to an upper theater of   water. 
                     Children are riding swans and   water   
       coils from the S-shaped necks and spills 
                        in flat foils from pincered bills. 
                            A solemn curly-headed bull 
                            puts out a swollen tongue of   water.   
                                 Cupids naked are making   water   
                               into a font that never is full. 
                   A goddess is driving a chariot through   water. 
                         Her reins and whips are tight white   water. 
                         Bronze hoofs of horses wrangle with   water. 
                              Marble faces half hidden in leaves. 
                         Faces whose hair is leaves and grapes 
                         of stone are peering from living leaves. 
                                       Faces with mossy lips unlocked 
                                                               always uttering   water, 
                                                                                          water 
                                                wearing their features blank   
                                             their ears deaf, their eyes mad 
                                          or patient or blind or astonished at   water 
                                           always uttered out of their mouths.

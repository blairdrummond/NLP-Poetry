title : Argument Over, Amounting

author : Clark Coolidge

text : 
In edges, in barriers the tonal light of t
 the one thing removed overemphasizes tonally
 and you could hurry it, and it vanish and plan
  
 You go out on an avenue, but may be taken in despite
 your chordal list of hates, overcomings banished ready
 receiving you from a darkened cone, the one a beat
 behind the one you there are
  
 Then the I not part of the you equation, but the
 spider trying to build where it is written
 vibrates tentative
 I don’t want to talk to you about it anymore
 crystal region in its light, there are failures and 
 there are failures
  
 But it’s imperative, abrupt catch, that you sink the
 final catch, trounced morning
 this is awful but none other available, words reach
 and visually fail to tie audibly retire
 the pieces of the opening collision, and the reaches of
 turning aside remind
  
 I am hopefully
 this is position
 of the world overcome by
 and by the wind takes our voice
 the collateral one voice

title : To Arielle and the Moon

author : David Trinidad

text : 
The night reduced to a siren, a sigh: 

Beautiful boy on the treadmill 

Glimpsed sweating through sweating glass— 

My new moon. 

Sylvia’s moon: a smiling skull 

Snagged in witchy branches; fossil 

Brushed free of blackest earth. 

My last moon: an orange ball at rest, for an instant, 

On the grey lake. 

Wish list: dining set and dresser, 

Boombox, thin black tie, boy- 

Friend à la Madonna’s “True Blue” 

La la la la la la la 

Your moon (tonight): a clouded X-ray. 

I stand at a corner and stare up, 

Both of us astonished 

By its own secret light.

Pastoral, Couplet

Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
   Did after him the world seduce,
And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,
   Where nature was most plain and pure. 
He first enclosed within the gardens square
   A dead and standing pool of air,
And a more luscious earth for them did knead, 
   Which stupified them while it fed.
The pink grew then as double as his mind; 
   The nutriment did change the kind.
With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,
   And flowers themselves were taught to paint. 
The tulip, white, did for complexion seek,
   And learned to interline its cheek:
Its onion root they then so high did hold, 
   That one was for a meadow sold.
Another world was searched, through oceans new, 
   To find the Marvel of Peru.

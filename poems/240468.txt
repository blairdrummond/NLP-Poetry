title : River Ghost

text : 
Little Chihuahita shadowed beside Segundo barrio.
 A dead German sheperd with a broken neck lies
 on the side of the street for days. The stench
 of El Paso’s sewage in the air, a Mexican flag hugely
 flaps itself above the chain-linked fence
  
 topped with razor wire. In the morning blue mountains
 smog. South side of the border a man jogs.
 The river’s bank green, small trees bob in the wind
 like truffle-treats, mirage. Each day thousands cross
 the open bridge, both ways,
  
 each night they go home to sleep silence. Cars hum
 and wait for hours like sleeping cats. A cemented river
 half-dried, even the canal drains away. Some say droves
 of shadows at night move ghost-like through the dying river.
 These people grow invisible, as if air, irrelevant and holy;
  
 at night I can hear the whisper of my grandfather,
 “all the angels live in Juárez.”
 There is an old language broken in my throat.
 Some eyes mistake me for shadow. When I speak my voice
 a fearful phantom. In spring dust storms come, the sky
  
 browns, my visage half-forms beneath the Italian cypress;
 and when the day’s moon is full in its silence,
 I am afraid of my own darkness.

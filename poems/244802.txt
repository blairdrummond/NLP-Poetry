title : from A Treatise on Painting

text : 
. . . some days ago I saw the picture of an Angel who, in making the Annunciation, seemed to be trying to chase Mary out of her room with movements showing the sort of attack one might make on some hated enemy; and Mary, as if desperate, seemed to be trying to throw herself out of the window. Do not fall into errors like these.                                                                                                   — Leonardo da Vinci
It is time to speak of the lies
             of images, omissions, insertions—
  
             imitations of reality,
  
                         but whose reality, Leonardo?
  
      For you she’s in nature—
  
                  you’ve lavished so much attention
                                       on rock formations along your raised horizon
                  varieties of grass in the lawn
                  cloud convocations
  
                           and the shadow the archangel casts
             obliterating most of what’s imagined growing there
  
                         and she, lovely, composed—“great grace of shadows and of lights is added 
to the faces of those who sit” beside the darkness of brown plasterwork—her right arm
 almost deformed, too far forward,
  
                         reaching out at an impossible angle—
  
                                                 FOR WHAT
  
 —Botticelli, Campin, van Eyck—for you
  
 she’s indoors all decked out in luscious silk and satin,
 surrounded by finery—tied-back drapery, carved benches,
 a rug or tiled floor, loggias
 and archways beyond her wildest ken
 windows revealing hortus conclusi and winding paths
               slogging toward the sea

And what of all those blues and golds, so rife with wealth
  
             in her life there’s only red from madder juice
             and yellow from kaolin clay
                         and a linen shift all frayed
  
 The truth also is a small opening high up on the wall
 A floor that’s hard-packed dirt
 And beyond the room, villagers working the fields,
 donkeys dragging threshing boards over newly harvested wheat
  
             AND EVERYWHERE, INSIDE AND OUT, WORLD-MOTHETING DUST
  
                                          For all of you
 this is an event reduced to a book she cannot read
 a lily she does not smell
 a lectern she never owned
  
 She might as well comb her hair with a stiletto heel
 Make of her body a cloud of white tulle
 Carry a watering can and wear shapely wooden clogs
 Fake glamour in a black bare-back gown
 Crouch on the ground flipping coins
 Pop a pogo stick between her legs and levitate
  
                           SHE COULD BE ANYONE            ANYWHERE             ANYTIME
  
  
 She could be sitting in her slip, bored,
 bored to death, the intercom
 image appearing out of nowhere,
 announcing a stranger
  
             (prima materia, take a deep breath
  
             (for divinity to enter the world,
                         your mystery must be experienced
  
 Her eyes will go wide, not expecting this
  
 Her ears have encountered only silence
  
             and the soft moan of a dove
                         (OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
  
 The trees thin
 The cumulus sky crackles ever so quietly
 Somewhere a rainbow breaks
  
             too loud now
                         too strident
  
                         He’s gotten in
  
 Hail comes in pellets
             (heavy hitters
  
             She will be patient
             and hear him out
                         though what she really wants is to get back under the covers
                         that are damask, but a lie—
                                     (rough-hewn flax is what she’d have)
  
 Or she could be blending a batch of myrrh
 and roses to deodorize the foul
 stench of the room that opens out
 not on a vista of budding poplars
 but on sewage,
 piles of it
 come to rot at the side of the road
 just there, in front of her door
             where broken planks of wood lean
             and bleating sheep wait to be herded up the hill
  
 But here’s this guy breezing in
  
                              (Titan, El Greco paint his feet unplanted on the ground
                                          (is he preparing for a quick getaway
                                                      or must he be higher on the picture plane
                              (Tintoretto catches him in mid-flight, a show-off, he
                              (Martini and Crivelli force him to his knees
  
 The breeze may be the whisper of something
               she is in danger of losing
  
                              (the breeze may be her destiny
  
  
 or his feathers could begin to moult
                              (transaction of feathers,
                              (light as a feather
                                                 in the face of all that dust she can’t escape
  
 or she could cringe at wings,
                                   voracious, unfurled,
 trying to scoop her up, knock her down,
 drown her in their soft pile,
  
 snuff out any NO she stashes in her mind,
 or the wind could whip his feathers
 and blow the townsfolk quickly to her side
  
           (Today, she knows no one will arrive in time . . . )
  
           Certainly not those people tending their gardens,
                       (as if anyone had topiary trees
                                as Rogier van der Weyden (possibly Memling) shows
  
                                                 (read fields of barley and wheat
                                                               and plows, plenty of plows
  
 In his eyes, pools of light map no pollution, only flame
 In hers, no flecks, no threads mar the cobalt calm
  
             until his hail scumbles their surface
  
             What is she to make of it
  
 Her lids lower
  
 Chrysalises, her eyes close on their private dusk
                         (she’s already seen her share of Roman crucifixions
  
             (perhaps the future is there and her eyes seek the great above
                              where son and mother will be united
             (perhaps she conjugates the months—
                                               (nine is real—
                                   (a number done on her
  
             (perhaps she dabbles with using rue to end the thing
  
                                               SHE’S GOT A CHOICE AFTER ALL
  
  
 For the child she will have boundless love
  
 For posterity the memory of being
  
 For her life no proper translation

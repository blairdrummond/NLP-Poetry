title : The Salt Stronger

author : Fred Marchant

text : 
I have seen the legislators
 on their way,
 the jacketless men
 in mid-winter who will cast
 their votes like stones for this war.
  
 Men who have to cross the street
 through slush
 and over gutter, their cuffs
 now vaguely blued with a salt
 that dries in dots where it splashes,
  
 and mingles with the finely
 woven cloth
 of the chalk-stripe suits,
 the soi-disant practical men,
 you can see them now tiptoeing,
  
 now leaping, balletic, windsor-knotted,
 fragrant
 and shaved,
 they pass, they pass
 the window of the Capitol Deli
  
 wherein I am writing to my friend
 in Baghdad,
 he a “witness for peace,” 
 a poet who for years has wondered
 what good poetry is or has been or does.
  
 I compose today’s answer from here,
 saying,
I think of poetry
as a salt dug from a foreign mine
 that arrives like a miracle in Boston
  
 as pellets to break underfoot
 and melt
 the dangerous plated ice
 and cling to the acknowledged lawmakers,
 to stay with them in their dreams,
  
 to eat at the cloth and reach down
 to the skin
 and beyond the calf
 into the shin. I think the soul
 is equivalent to bone, and that conscience
  
 must hide in the marrow,
 float in the rich fluids
 and wander the honeycomb at the center.
 There, and not in the brain,
 or even the heart is where
  
 the words attach, where they land
 and settle,
 take root after the long
 passage through the body’s by-ways.
 Just think, I write, of how some poetry rolls
  
 off the tongue, then try to see the tongue
 in the case
 that faces me, a curious,
 thick extension of cow-flesh
 fresh from a butcher’s block, grainy and flush.
  
 I think that if my tongue alone could talk
 it would swear
 in any court that poetry
 tastes like the iodine in blood,
 or the  copper in spit, and makes a salt stronger than tears.

Living, Nature, Sorrow & Grieving

Rhymed Stanza

I sometimes hold it half a sin
         To put in words the grief I feel;
         For words, like Nature, half reveal
And half conceal the Soul within.

But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
         A use in   measured language lies;
         The sad mechanic exercise,
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.

In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
         Like coarsest clothes against the cold;
         But that large grief which these enfold
Is given in outline and no more.

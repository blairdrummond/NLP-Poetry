title : murder on the gowanus

author : Julian Talamantez Brolaski

text : 
swell me a bowl
 with lusty oil
 brightest under bis
 geynest under gore
  
 ecce who com
 inna perisan vestment
                    un monodatal voll
                    marines cd not hoist thee
  
 whose eyes go seaward   noreaster reeling
 thrashing at the mouth of the gowanus
 mischance upbrimmd
  
 sludgie helas, aloft
 sometimes honeysuckle can smell like MURTHER
  
               yr shining form to oil hath returned
               yr helmet now shall make a hive for bees
  
 it was no dream   I lay broad waking
 oil blossomed green, incarnadine
  
 s/thing keeps
 on testing me for tb
  
 is politer not to talk about
 beastly p.o.v.
  
 ludic
 like a succubus vomiting ivy
 lordly subtler
 grotesquerie
  
 you can bet it smelled like murther
 creped and crinolinnd along the noggin
 w/ a victorian western pin
  
 till I may see a plumper sludgie swim
 everlike rotund
 buddha—smack aghast
 everlike leo and thir friends
 marching in lockstep
 to the sunlit uplands.

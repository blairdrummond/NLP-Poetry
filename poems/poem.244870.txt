Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

One day in the dreamy summer,
     On the Sabbath hills, from afar
 We heard the solemn echoes
     Of the first fierce words of war.
  
 Ah, tell me, thou veiled Watcher
     Of the storm and the calm to come,
 How long by the sun or shadow
     Till these noises again are dumb.
  
 And soon in a hush and glimmer
     We thought of the dark, strange fight,
 Whose close in a ghastly quiet
     Lay dim in the beautiful night.
  
 Then we talk'd of coldness and pallor,
     And of things with blinded eyes
 That stared at the golden stillness
     Of the moon in those lighted skies;
  
 And of souls, at morning wrestling
     In the dust with passion and moan,
 So far away at evening
     In the silence of worlds unknown.
  
 But a delicate wind beside us
     Was rustling the dusky hours,
 As it gather'd the dewy odors
     Of the snowy jessamine-flowers.
  
 And I gave you a spray of the blossoms,
     And said: "I shall never know
 How the hearts in the land are breaking,
     My dearest, unless you go."

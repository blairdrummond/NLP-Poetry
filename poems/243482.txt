The guests are floating in the lobby,
 walking but also gliding to the front desk
 then away, checking in, checking out,
 muscular souls adorned in cotton,
 wool, and rayon, chewing the future
 inside their heads, slicing the air
 with ironed pleats, avoiding the camera
 at every turn so as, so as to get it right
 this time, which is the first time.
 “First cut, best cut!” the director shouts
 since this is also a silent film for the deaf
 and therefore everyone. His aim
 is to get the cast to see what they’ve
 been missing, to disregard the very sounds
 that they don’t hear to begin with,
 but would notice immediately 
 if they were gone. See how they glide
 on the ether above the floor.
 The insouciance, Lord. The insouciance!
 They are all here in the magic of the set,
 every soul in the guise of a guest
 going about her business, a rendezvous here,
 as assignation there, the solitary sipping
 at the bar. Someone striking appears
 at the door. The rain outside beats down
 on the streets with terrible force until all
 you can hear is the roar of the sky as it passes
 above, and then below, on its narrow tracks.

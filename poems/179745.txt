title : "Love of My Flesh, Living Death"

author : Lorna Dee Cervantes

text : 
after García Lorca
Once I wasn’t always so plain. 
I was strewn feathers on a cross 
of dune, an expanse of ocean 
at my feet, garlands of gulls. 

   Sirens and gulls. They couldn’t tame you. 
You know as well as they: to be 
a dove is to bear the falcon 
at your breast, your nights, your seas. 

   My fear is simple, heart-faced 
above a flare of etchings, a lineage 
in letters, my sudden stare. It’s you. 

   It’s you! sang the heart upon its mantel 
pelvis. Blush of my breath, catch 
of my see—beautiful bird—It’s you.

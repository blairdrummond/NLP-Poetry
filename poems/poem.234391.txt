After the Pleasure Party:  Lines Traced Under an Image of Amor Threatening
Herman Melville
1819-1891


Love, Desire
Poems for Weddings



Fear me, virgin whosoever 
Taking pride from love exempt, 
Fear me, slighted. Never, never 
Brave me, nor my fury tempt: 
Downy wings, but wroth they beat 
Tempest even in reason's seat.

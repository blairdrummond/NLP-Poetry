text : 
Plan of the City of O. The great square 
curves down toward the cathedral. The 
water runs out into night where the patron 
saint still maintains his loft. He enters 
from the lower level and pulls up the ladder 
after him. The woman and children and 
most of the old men spend their time painting 
pictures of the ladder. The rest lay the 
three kinds of stone or type the performance 
for the eastern quarter. There the first 
colony left its box-shaped mark. But   
the sun always goes down in several places, 
so the clocks serve as maps. And at the 
end of the nearest mountain stands the 
larger and less perfect box.

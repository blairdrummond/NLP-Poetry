                 “I think I’ll be the Buddha of this place”
  
                                     and sat himself
                                             down
  
          
         1.
 It’s a real rock
  
         (believe this first)
  
 Resting on actual sand at the surf’s edge:
 Muir Beach, California
  
         (like everything else I have
         somebody showed it to me and I found it by myself)
  
 Hard common stone
 Size of the largest haystack
 It moves when hit by waves
 Actually shudders
  
         (even a good gust of wind will do it
         if you sit real still and keep your mouth shut)
  
 Notched to certain center it
 Yields and then comes back to it:
  
 Wobbly tons
  
  
         2.
 Sitting here you look below to other rocks
 Precisely placed as rocks of Ryoanji:
 Foam like swept stones
  
         (the mind getting it all confused again:
         “snow like frosting on a cake”
         “rose so beautiful it don’t look real”)
  
 Isn’t there a clear example here
 Stone garden shown to me by
 Berkeley painter I never met
 A thousand books and somebody else’s boatride ROCKS
  
        (garden)
    
 EYE
  
         (nearly empty despite this clutter-image all
         the opposites cancelling out a
         CIRCULAR process: Frosting-snow)
  
 Or think of the monks who made it 4 hundred 50 years ago
 Lugged the boulders from the sea
 Swept to foam original gravelstone from sea
  
         (first saw it, even then, when finally they
         all looked up the
         instant AFTER it was made)
  
 And now all rocks are different and
 All the spaces in between
  
         (which includes about everything)
  
 The instant
 After it is made
  
  
         3.
 I have been in many shapes before I attained congenial form
 All those years on the beach, lifetimes . . .
  
 When I was a boy I used to watch the Pelican:
 It always seemed his wings broke
 And he dropped, like scissors, in the sea . . .
 Night fire flicking the shale cliff
 Balls tight as a cat after the cold swim
 Her young snatch sandy . . .
  
                       I have travelled
                        I have made a circuit
                        I have lived in 14 cities
                        I have been a word in a book
                        I have been a book originally
  
 Dychymig Dychymig: (riddle me a riddle)
  
         Waves and the sea. If you
         take away the sea
  
 Tell me what it is
   
  
         4.
 Yesterday the weather was nice there were lots of people
 Today it rains, the only other figure is far up the beach
  
         (by the curve of his body I know he leans against
         the tug of his fishingline: there is no separation)
  
 Yesterday they gathered and broke gathered and broke like
 Feeding swallows dipped down to pick up something ran back to
 Show it
 And a young girl with jeans rolled to mid-thigh ran
 Splashing in the rain creek
  
         “They’re all so damned happy—
         why can’t they admit it?”
  
 Easy enough until a little rain shuts beaches down . . .
  
  
 Did it mean nothing to you Animal that turns this
 Planet to a smoky rock?
 Back among your quarrels
 How can I remind you of your gentleness?
  
         Jeans are washed
         Shells all lost or broken
         Driftwood sits in shadow boxes on a tracthouse wall
  
 Like swallows you were, gathering
 Like people I wish for . . .
  
  
         cannot even tell this to that fisherman
   
    
         5.
 3 of us in a boat the size of a bathtub   .   pitching in
 slow waves   .   fish poles over the side   .   oars
  
 We rounded a point of rock and entered a small cove
  
 Below us:
                 fronds of kelp
                 fish
                 crustaceans
                 eels
 Then us
                 then rocks at the cliff’s base
                 starfish
                 (hundreds of them sunning themselves)
                 final starfish on the highest rock then
 Cliff
                 4 feet up the cliff a flower
                 grass
                 further up more grass
                 grass over the cliff’s edge
                 branch of pine then
 Far up the sky
  
                 a hawk
  
 Clutching to our chip we are jittering in a spectrum
 Hung in the film of this narrow band
 Green
                 to our eyes only
   
   
         6.
 On a trail not far from here
 Walking in meditation
 We entered a dark grove
 And I lost all separation in step with the
 Eucalyptus as the trail walked back beneath me
  
 Does it need to be that dark or is
 Darkness only its occasion
 Finding it by ourselves knowing
 Of course
 Somebody else was there before . . .
  
 I like playing that game
 Standing on a high rock looking way out over it all:
  
                                “I think I’ll call it the Pacific”
  
  
 Wind water
 Wave rock
 Sea sand
  
 
                   (there is no separation)
  
 Wind that wets my lips is salt
 Sea breaking within me balanced as the
 Sea that floods these rocks. Rock
 Returning to the sea, easily, as
 Sea once rose from it. It
 Is a sea rock
  
                   (easily)
  
   
 I am
 Rocked by the sea

title : To Fanny

author : John Keats

text : 
I cry your mercy—pity—love! Aye, love!
   Merciful love that tantalizes not,
One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,
   Unmasked, and being seen—without a blot!
O! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine!
   That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest
Of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine,
   That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,—
Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
   Withhold no atom’s atom or I die,
Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,
   Forget, in the mist of idle misery,
Life’s purposes,—the palate of my mind
   Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!

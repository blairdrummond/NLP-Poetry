author : Platonic Love Curt Anderson

text : 
We dine at Adorno and return to my Beauvoir. 
She compliments me on my Bachelard pad. 
I pop in a Santayana CD and Saussure back to the couch. 
On my way, I pull out two fine Kristeva wine glasses. 
I pour some Merleau-Ponty and return the Aristotle to Descartes. 
After pausing an Unamuno, I wrap my arm around her Hegel. 
Her hair smells of wild Lukacs and Labriola. 
Our small talk expands to include Dewey, Moore and Kant. 
I confess to her what's in my Eckhart. We Locke. 
By this point, we're totally Blavatsky. 
We stretch out on the Schopenhauer. 
She slips out of her Lyotard and I fumble with my Levi-Strauss. 
She unhooks her Buber and I pull off my Spinoza. 
I run my finger along her Heraclitus as she fondles my Bacon. 
She stops to ask me if I brought any Kierkegaard. I nod. 
We Foucault. 
She lights a cigarette and compares Foucault to Lacan. 
I roll over and Derrida.

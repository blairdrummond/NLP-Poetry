Epigram

Be kind and tender to the Frog, 
   And do not call him names, 
As 'Slimy skin,' or 'Polly-wog,' 
   Or likewise 'Ugly James,' 
Or 'Gape-a-grin,' or 'Toad-gone-wrong,'   
   Or 'Billy Bandy-knees': 
The Frog is justly sensitive 
   To epithets like these. 
No animal will more repay 
   A treatment kind and fair; 
At least so lonely people say 
Who keep a frog (and, by the way,   
They are extremely rare).

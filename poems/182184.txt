title : Wipe That Simile Off Your Aphasia

author : Harryette Mullen

text : 
as horses as for 
as purple as we go 
as heartbeat as if 
as silverware as it were 
as onion as I can   
as cherries as feared 
as combustion as want 
as dog collar as expected 
as oboes as anyone 
as umbrella as catch can 
as penmanship as it gets 
as narcosis as could be 
as hit parade as all that 
as icebox as far as I know 
as fax machine as one can imagine 
as cyclones as hoped 
as dictionary as you like 
as shadow as promised 
as drinking fountain as well 
as grassfire as myself 
as mirror as is 
as never as this

title : Unusually Warm March Day, Leading to Storms

author : Francesca Abbate

Everything is half here, 
like the marble head 
of the Roman emperor 
and the lean torso 
of his favorite. 
The way the funnel cloud 
which doesn't seem 
to touch ground does— 
flips a few cars, a semi— 
we learn to walk miles 
above our bodies. 
The pig farms dissolve, 
then the small hills. 
As in dreams fraught 
with irrevocable gestures, 
the ruined set seems larger, 
a charred palace the gaze 
tunnels through 
and through. How well 
we remember the stage— 
the actors gliding about 
like petite sails, the balustrade 
cooling our palms. 
Not wings or singing, 
but a darkness fast as blood. 
It ended at our fingertips: 
the fence gave way 
to the forest. 
The world began.

‘I have always felt that desolation, that hell itself, is most powerfully expressed in an uninhabited natural landscape at its bleakest.’  —Anthony Hecht 
1. 

To each his own hell. Mine was an uninhabited 
landscape as far from nature as you can get 
without actually leaving the planet, a man-made 

moon waste on Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn, 
fired in the sun’s kiln through unending 
afternoons when I was nine or ten. 

I can never get the whole scene put together 
in my head, thanks to whatever guardian 
spirit flags down potentially dangerous 

intruders on the verge of memory, 
but parts of me hold parts of it: my ears 
play out the hissing wires’ repeated rise 

and fall, dry waves breaking above pavement; 
my nostrils chafe where fumes of gasoline 
weep from soft tarred patches in the asphalt; 

through a chainlink grid, my eyes take in 
some lot’s trapped beach, its black sand an amalgam 
of gravel, soot, and broken glass; or they blink 

in sequence with the traffic light’s perpetual 
solitaire at a carless intersection, 
flicking over greens, ambers, reds; 

my hands remember enough not to touch 
the shut steel trap doors of delivery chutes 
where air trembles over surfaces 

as at their beginnings in a furnace. 
What fills my mind to bursting is emptiness, 
the spirit of inverted Genesis 

transforming light and water’s urge towards fullness 
into a miracle of unearthly loss.

Sentries, a pair of gasoline pumps napped. 
Their rubber arms dangled groundwards and looped 
back up, hanging slack from the brass lapel 

their trigger-fingers hooked at shoulder height. 
They were no angels, but kept the gate of hell 
whenever I made visits to the angels. 

Behind them, next to a roll-up garage door 
always rolled up, with an invisible car 
always risen above the stone lintel 

on the hydraulic lift, a soft drink cooler 
sat coffin-like against the stucco wall. 
And always songs from a hidden radio 

promised cool mountain rivers to the hot 
flat city: somebody else must have listened, 
but I never saw a soul in all my visits. 

The angels’ wings fluttered the moment I raised 
the lid, a potent shimmer, as if the sun 
itself shone from the chest, not its reflections 

playing off the steel bars and icy waters. 
The angels sat in rows between the bars, 
their orders chevroned by the shapes and colours 

of their glass capes: the bluish, scalloped whorl 
of cherubim, the powers’ straight sheer crystal, 
the emerald flare of flaming seraphim— 

all emissaries from the sky-washed shore 
of heaven. To put a coin in the dispenser, 
slide one of them along its plated channel 

and lift it free through the chest’s narrow gate— 
to kiss the cold stars of its distillation— 
was not important; it was only important 

to see the angels swimming in the glitter 
and dip my fingers in their flickering water 
at the centre of that man-made desert, 

knowing that they were man-made, and might shatter.

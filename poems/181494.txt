He wore a little spiraled hat and wrote a song 
that everyone sang. He lived on the mountainside 
above a lake with a mythical beast he’d subdued. 
A train circled the village each hour, over and over, 
as he leaned down over the clock of   his world 
where people were days becoming months and years. 
In a park, from the hides of  ten cows, he’d constructed 
a  giant ball that everyone touched until it became 
a torn rag. He had no family, and because he worried 
so much about them: What if, what if, what if, like another 
beast pawing away, he’d invented a vitamin for everyone 
old that allowed you to continue slowly to grow 
until you forgot everything you once knew.

title : Lioness Asleep

Content that now the bleeding bone be swept 
Out of her reach, she lay upon her side. 
In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept, she slept 
Bland as a child, slept, breathing like a bride. 
Color of noons that shimmer as they sing 
Above the dunes, her sandy flanks heaved slow. 
Between her paws curled inward, billowing 
Waves of desert silence seemed to flow. 

The crowd was gone, the bars were gone, the cage 
Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas 
Winnowed by sleep to nothing. After food, 
Absence possessed her: bliss keener than rage, 
If slumberâ€™s prisoner at a bound could seize 
This ghostly freedom, lapping it like blood.

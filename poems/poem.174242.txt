Villanelle

They are all gone away,
      The House is shut and still,
There is nothing more to say.

Through broken walls and gray
      The winds blow bleak and shrill:
They are all gone away.

Nor is there one to-day
      To speak them good or ill:
There is nothing more to say.

Why is it then we stray
      Around the sunken sill?
They are all gone away,

And our poor fancy-play
      For them is wasted skill:
There is nothing more to say.

There is ruin and decay
      In the House on the Hill:
They are all gone away,
There is nothing more to say.

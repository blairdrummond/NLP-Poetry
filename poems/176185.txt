text : 
All our stones like as much sun as possible.
Along their joints run both solar access and decline 
In equal splendor, like a mica chipping
At every beat, being sun responsible.

How much sun then do you think is due them?
Or should say, how much sun do you think they are apt to have? 
It has misted at their roots for some days now,
The gray glamour addressing itself to them.

I should think possible that it go on misting likewise 
A good way into next year, or time as they have it, 
A regular cool season every day for our stones. 
Not a streak that low of any sun or longed surprise.

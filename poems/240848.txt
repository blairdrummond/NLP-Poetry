title : Bantams in Pine-Woods

author : Wallace Stevens

text : 
Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan
 Of tan with henna hackles, halt!
  
 Damned universal cock, as if the sun
 Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail.
  
 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal. 
 Your world is you. I am my world.
  
 You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat!
 Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines,
  
 Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs,
 And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos.

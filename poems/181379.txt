author : Emily Dickinson

text : 
I started Early – Took my Dog – 
And visited the Sea – 
The Mermaids in the BasementBasement i.e., the bottom of the ocean 
Came out to look at me – 

And FrigatesFrigates fast and highly maneuverable warships of the 18th and 19th centuries, used to escort other larger ships, or to patrol the coast and blockade harbors – in the Upper Floor 
Extended Hempen HandsHempen Hands strong, thick ropes made of hemp, used on ships – 
Presuming Me to be a Mouse – 
Aground – oponopon upon the Sands – 

But no Man moved Me – till the Tide 
Went past my simple Shoe – 
And past my Apron – and my Belt 
And past my BoddiceBoddice bodice; an upper part of a woman’s dress, or a rigid, laced corset worn underneath clothing, covering the upper part of a woman’s body – too – 

And made as He would eat me up – 
As wholly as a Dew 
Opon a Dandelion's Sleeve – 
And then – I started – too – 

And He – He followed – close behind – 
I felt His Silver Heel 
Opon my Ancle – Then My Shoes 
Would overflow with Pearl – 

Until We met the Solid Town – 
No One He seemed to know – 
And bowing – with a Mighty look – 
At me – The Sea withdrew –

title : The Afterbirth, 1931

We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk 
Who threw soil      not salt 
Over our shoulders 
Who tendered close the bible 
Who grew and passed around the almanac at night 
So we would know   
What to plant at first light 

Black soil and sweet brown sorghum 
From the every morning biscuits 
Mama Susan fixed 
Dripping and mixing 
Up under our fingernails 
A secret salve 
Just like any other 
Living simple 
And keeping to our proud selves 
Quite aware of night riders 
Quite aware of men with   
Politicious smiles 
Cologned with kerosene and match 

Aware of just whose feet 
Walked across our tin roofs at night 

We were such light sleepers 
Such long distance believers 

We were a family pregnant 
Whose water had broke 
And for once there was ham money 
’Bacca money 
So we thought to do better by ourselves 
To begin our next row 
We would go and get him 
Because he was medically degreed in baby bringing 
Because he was young and white and handsome 
And because of that 
Had been neighbor to more knowledge 
Than us way back behind   
The country’s proud but inferior lines 

And because he came with his papers in his pocket 
So convincing      so soon 
After his ivy graduation 
Asking us hadn’t we heard 
Telling us times had changed 
And the midwife wasn’t safe anymore 
Even though we had all been caught 
By tried and true Black Grannies 
Who lay ax blade sharp side up 
And water pan underneath the bed 
To cut the pain 
To cool the fever 

We were a Pregnant Clan of Kinfolk 
Caught with water running down our legs 
Old family say they remember   
Going to fetch him 
Telling him that it was time 
That he should come now 
But he didn’t show right away 
Not right away 
But came when he wanted 
The next day 
After his breakfast 

But what more 
Could we colored country folk ever want 
Even if we had to watch the road all night for him 
Even if we had to not let her push too hard 
When he finally came 
He had his papers on him 
Something with one of those pretty shiny seals 
Old family say they can remember 
Somethin’ just wasn’t right 
But we opened the screen for him anyway 
Trusting 
And tendering close what the Good Book 
Had told us all our lives to do 

Then we made him a path 
Where he put his hand up      then inside 
My grandmother’s womb 
Her precious private pleasing place 
Somewhere he probably didn’t want to touch 

Then he pulled my daddy through 
Somebody he probably didn’t care to reach for 
And from the first he pulled him wrong 
And wrong 
Shattered his collarbone 
And snapped his soft baby foot in half 
And smashed the cartilage in his infant hand 

Wringing 
Their own sun baked arms 
Old timey family 
Remember him well 
Say they knew somethin’ wasn’t right 
As he came through the door 
A day later 
His breakfast digested now 
Somethin’ just wasn’t right 
How he had two waters on him 
One sweet      one sour-mash 
One trying to throw snow quilt over the other 
As he un-carefully 
As drunkenly 
He with his papers on him still 
Stood there turning a brown baby into blue 
Un-magically 
And right before our eyes 

Hope and Pray 
Hope and Pray 

Then he packed his bag and      left 
With all of his official training 
And gathered up gold stars      left 
The Virginia land of Cumberland County 

He left and forgot 
He left and didn’t remember 
The afterbirth inside 
Carlene Godwin Finney 

To clabber 
Gangrene 
Close down 
Her place 
Her precious private pleasing place 
To fill the house to the rafters 
Up past the dimpled tin roof 
With a rotting smell 
That stayed for nine days 
That mortgaged a room 
In our memories 
And did not die with her 

We were a Brown and Pregnant Family 
And he would’ve remembered his schoolin’ 
And left his bottle 
Recollected his manners 
And brought his right mind 
Had another klan called him to their bedside 
He would’ve come right away 
He would’ve never had liquor on his breath 
If the color of my daddy’s broken limbs 
Had matched the color of his own but 

We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk 
We should’ve met him at the door 
Should’ve told him lean first into the rusty screen 
Made him open up his mouth and blow 
Breathe out right there 
Into all of our brown and lined up faces 
In wait of his worthiness 

Then just for good measure 
Should’ve made him blow once again 
Into Papa Josh’s truth telling jar 
Just to be sure 
Should’ve let Mama Sally 
Then Aunt Nanny 
Then lastly Aunt Mary   
Give him the final once over 
And hold his sterile hands 
Down to the firelight to check 
Just like she checked our own every night 
Before supper 
Before we were allowed to sit 
At her very particular table 

We could’ve let Aunt Ira clutch him by his chin 
Enter and leave through her eyes 
Just like how she came and went through us   
Everyday at her leisure 

She would’ve took care to notice 
As she traveled all up and through him 
Any shaking      any sweating 
And caught his incapable belligerent incompetence 
In time 

Oh Jesus 

We should’ve let Grandpop Robert 
Have him from the first 
Should’ve let him pick him up 
By the back of his pants 
And swirl him around 
Just like he picked us up 
And swirled us around 
Anytime he caught us lying or lazy 
Or being less than what we were 

We should’ve let Grandpop 
Loose on him from the start 
And he would’ve held him up 
High eye to the sun 
And looked straight through him 
Just like he held us up 
And then we would have known first 
Like he always knew first 
And brought to us 
The very map of his heart 
Then we would have known 
Just what his intentions were 
With our Carlene 

Before we knew his name 
Or cared about his many degrees 
Before he dared reach up      then inside 
Our family’s brown globe 
While we stood there 
Some of us throwing good black soil 
With one hand 
Some of us tending close 
The Good Book with the other 
Believing and trusting 
We were doing better 
By this one 
Standing there 

Waterfalls running 
Screaming whitewater rapids 

Down our pants legs 
Down our pantaloons 
To our many selves 

All the while   
Praying hard 
That maybe we were wrong 
(please make us wrong) 
One hundred proof 
Smelled the same as 
Isopropyl

I am the only one here.
  
 I stand in my one place
 and I can see a good piece
 down the road. I am yonder,
 further than the chunk of your stone.
 Right now, directly,
 I am persimmon falling free
 and the prisoner opening up
 in me.
 Don’t come through my door and
 want to run my house. I am
 the angel who sweep air in and out my own
 dancing body. I got good eyes. I can see.
 A good piece down the road. Clear to
 God murmuring in me. My head is the burning
 bush. What I hold in my hand is the promised
 land. I set my people free in me.
 And we walk without wandering like people named
 after mere plants,
 because we are tree
 and high-stepping roots
 cake-walking
 in this promised place.
  
 Where I go is where I am now.
 Don’t mess with me: you hurt yourself.
 In the middle of my stride now. I am walking
 yes indeed I am walking through my own house.
 I am walking yes indeed on my own piece of road.
 Toting my own load
 and yours and mine.
 I tell you
 I feel fine and clear this morning even
 when it’s night and a full moon with my thumbprint
 on it.
 Everything is clamorous and quiet.
             I am the only One here.
             And we don’t break. No indeed.
             Come hell and high water.
             We don’t break
             for nothing.

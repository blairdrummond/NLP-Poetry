title : Dark View

text : 
The sun that puts its spokes in every 
Wheel of manhandle and tree 

Derives its path of seashines 
(Sheer centrifugality) from my 

Regards. I send it 
My regards. Some yards 

Of lumen from the fabrika 
Have come unbolted from the look 

Of it (or likes of me), a long 
Unweaving or recarding I 

Cannot recall begun, and there 
Before my eyes a palm 

Puts lashes round the sun.

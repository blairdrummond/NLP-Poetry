title : Cautionary Tales

Beyond the field of grazing, gazing cows 
the great bull has a pasture to himself, 
monumental, black flanks barely twitching 
from the swarming flies. Only a few strands of 
wire separate us—how could I forget 
my childhood terror, the grownups warning 
that the old bull near my uncle’s farm 
would love to chase me, stomp me, gore me 
if I ever got too close. And so I 
skirted acres just to keep my distance, 
peeking through the leaves to see if he still 
was watching me, waiting for some foolish move— 
those fierce red eyes, the thunder in the ground— 
or maybe that was simply nightmares. It’s 
getting hard to tell, as years themselves keep 
gaining ground relentlessly, their hot breath 
on my back, and not a fence in sight.

title : At the Choral Concert

author : Tim Nolan

text : 
The high school kids are so beautiful 
in their lavender blouses and crisp white shirts. 
 
They open their mouths to sing with that 
far-off stare they had looking out from the crib. 
 
Their voices lift up from the marble bed 
of the high altar to the blue endless ceiling 
 
of heaven as depicted in the cloudy dome— 
and we—as the parents—crane our necks 
 
to see our children and what is above us— 
and ahead of us—until the end when we 
 
are invited up to sing with them—sopranos 
and altos—tenors and basses—to sing the great 
 
Hallelujah Chorus—and I’m standing with the other 
stunned and gray fathers—holding our sheet music— 
 
searching for our parts—and we realize— 
our voices are surprisingly rich—experienced— 
 
For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth— 
and how do we all know to come in 
 
at exactly the right moment?—Forever and ever— 
and how can it not seem that we shall reign 
 
forever and ever—in one voice with our beautiful 
children—looking out into all those lights.

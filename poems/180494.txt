title : The Girl Who Buried Snakes in a Jar

author : John Haines

text : 
She came to see the bones 
whiten in a summer, 
and one year later a narrow 
mummy with a dusty skin 
and flaking scales 
would break apart in her hand. 

She wanted to see if sunlight 
still glinted in those eyes, 
to know what it lighted 
from a window on the mallow roots, 
leaf mold and fallen casques. 

And to ask if a single tongue, 
one forked flicker in the dark, 
had found any heat in death: 
in the closed space and chill 
of that burial, what speech, 
what sign would there be. 

She who walked in the canyon early, 
parted the grass and halted 
upon the living snake, coiled 
and mottled by a bitter pool, 

unearthed her jar in another spring, 
to find the snake spirit gone, 
only a little green water standing, 
some dust, or a smell.

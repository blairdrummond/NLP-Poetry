title : At Twenty-Eight

author : Amy Fleury

text : 
It seems I get by on more luck than sense, 
not the kind brought on by knuckle to wood, 
breath on dice, or pennies found in the mud. 
I shimmy and slip by on pure fool chance. 
At turns charmed and cursed, a girl knows romance 
as coffee, red wine, and books; solitude 
she counts as daylight virtue and muted 
evenings, the inventory of absence. 
But this is no sorry spinster story, 
just the way days string together a life. 
Sometimes I eat soup right out of the pan. 
Sometimes I donâ€™t care if I will marry. 
I dance in my kitchen on Friday nights, 
singing like only a lucky girl can.

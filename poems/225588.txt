title : You Can't Buy Shoes in a Painting

author : Jill Osier

You can't even buy a soda. You can only 
see these things, see a mother steer 
her son to the car, his head cocked 
licking his ice cream. 

Earlier, driving, trying to keep   
between two cornfields, I couldn't see myself 
into a map, couldn't be anywhere in it, 
though I knew all the patient states 
between us. 

Pigeons sit high on a mill's peaked roof, 
spaced even as beads. They can stand that 
close to each other, but looking at them 
you wouldn't know it. Would you.

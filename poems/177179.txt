text : 
A strong song tows 
us, long earsick. 
Blind, we follow 
rain slant, spray flick 
to fields we do not know. 

Night, float us. 
Offshore wind, shout,   
ask the sea 
what’s lost, what’s left,   
what horn sunk, 
what crown adrift. 

Where we are who knows   
of kings who sup   
while day fails? Who,   
swinging his axe   
to fell kings, guesses   
where we go?

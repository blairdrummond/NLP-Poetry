title : Triolet

author : Sandra McPherson

text : 
She was in love with the same danger   
everybody is. Dangerous 
as it is to love a stranger, 
she was in love. With that same danger   
an adulteress risks a husband’s anger.   
Stealthily death enters a house:   
she was in love with that danger.   
Everybody is dangerous.

Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

The sun used to shine while we two walked
 Slowly together, paused and started
 Again, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked
 As either pleased, and cheerfully parted
  
 Each night. We never disagreed
 Which gate to rest on. The to be
 And the late past we gave small heed.
 We turned from men or poetry
  
 To rumours of the war remote
 Only till both stood disinclined
 For aught but the yellow flavorous coat
 Of an apple wasps had undermined;
  
 Or a sentry of dark betonies,
 The stateliest of small flowers on earth,
 At the forest verge; or crocuses
 Pale purple as if they had their birth
  
 In sunless Hades fields. The war
 Came back to mind with the moonrise
 Which soldiers in the east afar
 Beheld then. Nevertheless, our eyes
  
 Could as well imagine the Crusades
 Or Caesar's battles. Everything
 To faintness like those rumours fade--
 Like the brook's water glittering
  
 Under the moonlight--like those walks
 Now--like us two that took them, and
 The fallen apples, all the talks
 And silence--like memory's sand
  
 When the tide covers it late or soon,
 And other men through other flowers
 In those fields under the same moon
 Go talking and have easy hours.

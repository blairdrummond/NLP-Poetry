Blank Verse

THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood 
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above 
Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd 
The stonie from thir hearts, & made new flesh 
Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath'd 
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer 
Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight 
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port 
Not of mean suiters, nor important less 
Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair 
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, 
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore 
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine 
Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers 
Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes 
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd 
Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad 
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd, 
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight 
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son 
Presenting, thus to intercede began. 

See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung 
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs 
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt 
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, 
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed 
Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those 
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees 
Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n 
From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare 
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; 
Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet mee 
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate 
And propitiation, all his works on mee 
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those 
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. 
Accept me, and in mee from these receave 
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live 
Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days 
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I 
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) 
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee 
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, 
Made one with me as I with thee am one. 

To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. 
All thy request for Man, accepted Son, 
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: 
But longer in that Paradise to dwell, 
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: 
Those pure immortal Elements that know 
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, 
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off 
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, 
And mortal food, as may dispose him best 
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first 
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt 
Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts 
Created him endowd, with Happiness 
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, 
This other serv'd but to eternize woe; 
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes 
His final remedie, and after Life 
Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd 
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, 
Wak't in the renovation of the just, 
Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd. 
But let us call to Synod all the Blest 
Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide 
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, 
As how with peccant Angels late they saw; 
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. 

He ended, and the Son gave signal high 
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew 
His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps 
When God descended, and perhaps once more 
To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast 
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs 
Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, 
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate 
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light 
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, 
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream 
Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will. 

O Sons, like one of us Man is become 
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste 
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast 
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, 
Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known 
Good by it self, and Evil not at all. 
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, 
My motions in him, longer then they move, 
His heart I know, how variable and vain 
Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand 
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, 
And live for ever, dream at least to live 
For ever, to remove him I decree, 
And send him from the Garden forth to Till 
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. 

Michael, this my behest have thou in charge, 
Take to thee from among the Cherubim 
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend 
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade 
Vacant possession som new trouble raise: 
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God 
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, 
From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce 
To them and to thir Progenie from thence 
Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint 
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, 
For I behold them softn'd and with tears 
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. 
If patiently thy bidding they obey, 
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale 
To Adam what shall come in future dayes, 
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix 
My Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd; 
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: 
And on the East side of the Garden place, 
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, 
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame 
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, 
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: 
Least Paradise a receptacle prove 
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, 
With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. 

He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd 
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright 
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each 
Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape 
Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those 
Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, 
Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed 
Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while 
To resalute the World with sacred Light 
Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd 
The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve 
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found 
Strength added from above, new hope to spring 
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; 
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. 

Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all 
The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends; 
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n 
So prevalent as to concerne the mind 
Of God high-blest, or to incline his will, 
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, 
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne 
Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught 
By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, 
Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, 
Methought I saw him placable and mild, 
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew 
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd 
Home to my Brest, and to my memorie 
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; 
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now 
Assures me that the bitterness of death 
Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, 
Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, 
Mother of all things living, since by thee 
Man is to live, and all things live for Man. 

To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. 
Ill worthie I such title should belong 
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind 
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach 
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: 
But infinite in pardon was my Judge, 
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't 
The sourse of life; next favourable thou, 
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st, 
Farr other name deserving. But the Field 
To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, 
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, 
All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins 
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, 
I never from thy side henceforth to stray, 
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind 
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, 
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? 
Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. 

So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate 
Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest 
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd 
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight 
The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, 
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: 
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, 
First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, 
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; 
Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. 
Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase 
Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. 

O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, 
Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews 
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn 
Us haply too secure of our discharge 
From penaltie, because from death releast 
Some days; how long, and what till then our life, 
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, 
And thither must return and be no more. 
Why else this double object in our fight 
Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground 
One way the self-same hour? why in the East 
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light 
More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws 
O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, 
And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. 

He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands 
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now 
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, 
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt 
And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. 
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met 
Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw 
The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; 
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd 
In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, 
Against the Syrian King, who to surprize 
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, 
Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch 
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise 
Possession of the Garden; hee alone, 
To find where Adam shelterd, took his way, 
Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, 
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. 

Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps 
Of us will soon determin, or impose 
New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie 
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill 
One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate 
None of the meanest, some great Potentate 
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie 
Invests him coming; yet not terrible, 
That I should fear, nor sociably mild, 
As Raphael, that I should much confide, 
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, 
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. 
He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, 
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man 
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes 
A militarie Vest of purple flowd 
Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine 
Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old 
In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff; 
His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime 
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side 
As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, 
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. 
Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State 
Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. 

Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: 
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, 
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, 
Defeated of his seisure many dayes 
Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, 
And one bad act with many deeds well done 
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd 
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime; 
But longer in this Paradise to dwell 
Permits not; to remove thee I am come, 
And send thee from the Garden forth to till 
The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. 

He added not, for Adam at the newes 
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, 
That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen 
Yet all had heard, with audible lament 
Discover'd soon the place of her retire. 

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! 
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave 
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, 
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, 
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day 
That must be mortal to us both. O flours, 
That never will in other Climate grow, 
My early visitation, and my last 
At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand 
From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, 
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke 
Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? 
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd 
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee 
How shall I part, and whither wander down 
Into a lower World, to this obscure 
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire 
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? 

Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. 
Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne 
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, 
Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine; 
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes 
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; 
Where he abides, think there thy native soile. 

Adam by this from the cold sudden damp 
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, 
To Michael thus his humble words addressd. 

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd 
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem 
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould 
Thy message, which might else in telling wound, 
And in performing end us; what besides 
Of sorrow and dejection and despair 
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, 
Departure from this happy place, our sweet 
Recess, and onely consolation left 
Familiar to our eyes, all places else 
Inhospitable appeer and desolate, 
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer 
Incessant I could hope to change the will 
Of him who all things can, I would not cease 
To wearie him with my assiduous cries: 
But prayer against his absolute Decree 
No more availes then breath against the winde, 
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: 
Therefore to his great bidding I submit. 
This most afflicts me, that departing hence, 
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd 
His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, 
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd 
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; 
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree 
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice 
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: 
So many grateful Altars I would reare 
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone 
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, 
Or monument to Ages, and thereon 
Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours: 
In yonder nether World where shall I seek 
His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? 
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd 
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now 
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts 
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. 

To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. 
Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth. 
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills 
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, 
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: 
All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, 
No despicable gift; surmise not then 
His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd 
Of Paradise or Eden: this had been 
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred 
All generations, and had hither come 
From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate 
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. 
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down 
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: 
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine 
God is as here, and will be found alike 
Present, and of his presence many a signe 
Still following thee, still compassing thee round 
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face 
Express, and of his steps the track Divine. 
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd 
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent 
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes 
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad 
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending 
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn 
True patience, and to temper joy with fear 
And pious sorrow, equally enur'd 
By moderation either state to beare, 
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead 
Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure 
Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend 
This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) 
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, 
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. 

To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. 
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path 
Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, 
However chast'ning, to the evil turne 
My obvious breast, arming to overcom 
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, 
If so I may attain.   So both ascend 
In the Visions of God: It was a Hill 
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top 
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken 
Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. 
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, 
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set 
Our second Adam in the Wilderness, 
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. 
His Eye might there command wherever stood 
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat 
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls 
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can 
And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, 
To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence 
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul 
Down to the golden Chersonese, or where 
The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since 
In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar 
In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, 
Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken 
Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port 
Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings 
Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, 
And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme 
Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; 
Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount 
The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, 
Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; 
On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway 
The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw 
Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, 
And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat 
Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd 
Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons 
Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights 
Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd 
Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight 
Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue 
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; 
And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. 
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, 
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, 
That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, 
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: 
But him the gentle Angel by the hand 
Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. 

Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold 
Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought 
In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd 
Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, 
Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive 
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. 

His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, 
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves 
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; 
Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood 
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon 
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought 
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, 
Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next 
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock 
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid 
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, 
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. 
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n 
Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; 
The others not, for his was not sincere; 
Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, 
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone 
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale 
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. 
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart 
Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. 

O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n 
To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; 
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? 

T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. 
These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come 
Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, 
For envie that his Brothers Offering found 
From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact 
Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd 
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, 
Rowling in dust and gore.   To which our Sire. 

Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! 
But have I now seen Death? Is this the way 
I must return to native dust? O sight 
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, 
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! 

To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen 
In his first shape on man; but many shapes 
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead 
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense 
More terrible at th' entrance then within. 
Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, 
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more 
In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring 
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew 
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know 
What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve 
Shall bring on men.   Immediately a place 
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, 
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid 
Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies 
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes 
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, 
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, 
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, 
Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie 
And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie, 
Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence, 
Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. 
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair 
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; 
And over them triumphant Death his Dart 
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't 
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. 
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long 
Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, 
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd 
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears 
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, 
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. 

O miserable Mankind, to what fall 
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd! 
Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n 
To be thus wrested from us? rather why 
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew 
What we receive, would either not accept 
Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, 
Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus 
Th' Image of God in man created once 
So goodly and erect, though faultie since, 
To such unsightly sufferings be debas't 
Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, 
Retaining still Divine similitude 
In part, from such deformities be free, 
And for his Makers Image sake exempt? 

Thir Makers Image,   answerd Michael, then 
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd 
To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took 
His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, 
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. 
Therefore so abject is thir punishment, 
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, 
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't 
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules 
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they 
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. 

I yield it just,   said Adam,   and submit. 
But is there yet no other way, besides 
These painful passages, how we may come 
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust; 

There is,   said Michael,   if thou well observe 
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught 
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence 
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, 
Till many years over thy head return: 
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop 
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease 
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: 
This is old age; but then thou must outlive 
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change 
To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then 
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, 
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth 
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne 
A Melancholy damp of cold and dry 
To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume 
The Balme of Life.   To whom our Ancestor. 

Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong 
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit 
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, 
Which I must keep till my appointed day 
Of rendring up, and patiently attend 
My dissolution.   Michael repli'd. 

Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst 
Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: 
And now prepare thee for another sight. 

He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon 
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds 
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound 
Of Instruments that made melodious chime 
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd 
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch 
Instinct through all proportions low and high 
Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. 
In other part stood one who at the Forge 
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire 
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, 
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot 
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream 
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind 
Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd 
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought 
Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After these, 
But on the hether side a different sort 
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, 
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise 
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent 
To worship God aright, and know his works 
Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve 
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain 
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold 
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay 
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung 
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: 
The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes 
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net 
Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; 
And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star 
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat 
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke 
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; 
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. 
Such happy interview and fair event 
Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, 
And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart 
Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, 
The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. 

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, 
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope 
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; 
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, 
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. 

To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best 
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, 
Created, as thou art, to nobler end 
Holie and pure, conformitie divine. 
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents 
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race 
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere 
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, 
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit 
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. 
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; 
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd 
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, 
Yet empty of all good wherein consists 
Womans domestic honour and chief praise; 
Bred onely and completed to the taste 
Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, 
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. 
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives 
Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, 
Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame 
Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles 
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, 
(Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which 
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. 

To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. 
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well 
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread 
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! 
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe 
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. 

From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, 
Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place 
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd. 
But now prepare thee for another Scene. 

He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred 
Before him, Towns, and rural works between, 
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, 
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, 
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; 
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, 
Single or in Array of Battel rang'd 
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; 
One way a Band select from forage drives 
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine 
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, 
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, 
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, 
But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray; 
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; 
Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies 
With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field 
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong 
Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, 
Assaulting; others from the wall defend 
With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; 
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. 
In other part the scepter'd Haralds call 
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon 
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, 
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon 
In factious opposition, till at last 
Of middle Age one rising, eminent 
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, 
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, 
And Judgment from above: him old and young 
Exploded and had seiz'd with violent hands, 
Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence 
Unseen amid the throng: so violence 
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law 
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. 
Adam was all in tears, and to his guide 
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, 
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death 
Inhumanly to men, and multiply 
Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew 
His Brother; for of whom such massacher 
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? 
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n 
Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? 

To whom thus Michael. These are the product 
Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw'st; 
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves 
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, 
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. 
Such were these Giants, men of high renown; 
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, 
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; 
To overcome in Battle, and subdue 
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite 
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch 
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done 
Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, 
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, 
Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. 
Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on Earth, 
And what most merits fame in silence hid. 
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst 
The onely righteous in a World perverse, 
And therefore hated, therefore so beset 
With Foes for daring single to be just, 
And utter odious Truth, that God would come 
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High 
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds 
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God 
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, 
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward 
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; 
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. 

He look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd, 
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, 
All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, 
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, 
Marrying or prostituting, as befell, 
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire 
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. 
At length a Reverend Sire among them came, 
And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, 
And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft 
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, 
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd 
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls 
In Prison under Judgements imminent: 
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd 
Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; 
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, 
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, 
Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth, 
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore 
Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large 
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! 
Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small 
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught 
Thir order: last the Sire, and his three Sons 
With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore. 
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings 
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove 
From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie 
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, 
Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie 
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain 
Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth 
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum 
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow 
Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else 
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp 
Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, 
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces 
Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd 
And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, 
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. 
How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold 
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, 
Depopulation; thee another Floud, 
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, 
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard 
By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, 
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns 
His Children, all in view destroyd at once; 
And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. 

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I 
Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne 
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot 
Anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst 
The burd'n of many Ages, on me light 
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth 
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, 
With thought that they must be. Let no man seek 
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall 
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, 
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, 
And hee the future evil shall no less 
In apprehension then in substance feel 
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, 
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't 
Famin and anguish will at last consume 
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope 
When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, 
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd 
With length of happy dayes the race of man; 
But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see 
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. 
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, 
And whether here the Race of man will end. 
To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst 
In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they 
First seen in acts of prowess eminent 
And great exploits, but of true vertu void; 
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste 
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby 
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, 
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, 
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride 
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. 
The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr 
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose 
And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd 
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide 
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale 
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, 
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords 
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear 
More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: 
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, 
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; 
One Man except, the onely Son of light 
In a dark Age, against example good, 
Against allurement, custom, and a World 
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, 
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes 
Shall them admonish, and before them set 
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, 
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come 
On thir impenitence; and shall returne 
Of them derided, but of God observd 
The one just Man alive; by his command 
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, 
To save himself and household from amidst 
A World devote to universal rack. 
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast 
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, 
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts 
Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre 
Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep 
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp 
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise 
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount 
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd 
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, 
With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift 
Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, 
And there take root an Iland salt and bare, 
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. 
To teach thee that God attributes to place 
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought 
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. 
And now what further shall ensue, behold. 

He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, 
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, 
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie 
Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; 
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass 
Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, 
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink 
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole 
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt 
His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. 
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground 
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. 
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; 
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive 
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. 
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, 
And after him, the surer messenger, 
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie 
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; 
The second time returning, in his Bill 
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: 
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke 
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; 
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, 
Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds 
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow 
Conspicuous with three listed colours gay, 
Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. 
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad 
Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. 

O thou who future things canst represent 
As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive 
At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live 
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. 
Farr less I now lament for one whole World 
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce 
For one Man found so perfet and so just, 
That God voutsafes to raise another World 
From him, and all his anger to forget. 
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, 
Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, 
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde 
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, 
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? 

To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; 
So willingly doth God remit his Ire, 
Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, 
Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw 
The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh 
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, 
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, 
That he relents, not to blot out mankind, 
And makes a Covenant never to destroy 
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea 
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World 
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings 
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set 
His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look 
And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, 
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost 
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, 
Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.

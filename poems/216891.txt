title : Road

text : 
This is what poetry is (says the Road), 
a laying down of uniform pattern 
across a land you can't control 
but which you think it best to flatten. 
It's far from vivid. Look at the whole 
flamboyant forest! Look at the paths 
that can't be uttered by a mouth 
and at the scattered arcs of light 
more integral to this wide planet 
than words will ever be. Your lines? 
Like railroad tracks that cut the bracken, 
bring something through, then disappear. 
No one knows what speck was taken 
or where it moved, and no one cares.

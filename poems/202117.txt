title : For a Girl Killed at Sea

author : Calvin Thomas Jr.

text : 
I see the ships, the plotted crash, 
The stateroomâ€™s purgatory trash, 
The waiting wedged and still no splash. 
There is the torch that burns not through 
Unless it drowns the sailor crew 
Shoring the bulkhead pinning you. 
And then the priest who, being ill, 
Intones through steel the bitter pill: 
This tomb is your last confession grille. 
I think of you awake in bed, 
Praying what all the voyage said: 
Have done with dying and be dead. 
It is a pride in loneliness 
Like some propriety of dress 
That shuns the water meant to bless; 
My hand as from a magnet pole 
Works to the Sunday dipping bowl 
To spot my tie and cross my soul.

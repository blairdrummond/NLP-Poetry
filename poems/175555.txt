title : V Mon. July [1747] hath xxxi days.

author : Benjamin Franklin

text : 
Men drop so fast, ere Life’s mid Stage we tread, 
Few know so many Friends alive as dead; 
Yet, as immortal, in our uphill Chace, 
We press coy Fortune with unslacken’d Pace; 
Our ardent Labours for the Toy we seek, 
Join Night to Day, and Sunday to the Week, 
Our very Joys are anxious, and expire 
Between Satiety and fierce Desire.

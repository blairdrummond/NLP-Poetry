title : The Garden

for Robert Penn Warren
It shines in the garden, 
in the white foliage of the chestnut tree,   
in the brim of my father’s hat 
as he walks on the gravel. 

In the garden suspended in time   
my mother sits in a redwood chair:   
light fills the sky, 
the folds of her dress, 
the roses tangled beside her. 

And when my father bends 
to whisper in her ear, 
when they rise to leave 
and the swallows dart 
and the moon and stars 
have drifted off together, it shines. 

Even as you lean over this page,   
late and alone, it shines: even now   
in the moment before it disappears.

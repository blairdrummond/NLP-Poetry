title : Prayer Rug

author : Agha Shahid Ali

text : 
Those intervals   
between the day’s   
five calls to prayer 

the women of the house   
pulling thick threads   
through vegetables 

rosaries of ginger   
of rustling peppers 
in autumn drying for winter 

in those intervals this rug   
part of Grandma’s dowry   
folded 

so the Devil’s shadow   
would not desecrate   
Mecca scarlet-woven 

with minarets of gold   
but then the sunset   
call to prayer 

the servants 
their straw mats unrolled   
praying or in the garden 

in summer on grass   
the children wanting   
the prayers to end 

the women’s foreheads   
touching Abraham’s   
silk stone of sacrifice 

black stone descended   
from Heaven 
the pilgrims in white circling it 

this year my grandmother   
also a pilgrim   
in Mecca she weeps 

as the stone is unveiled   
she weeps holding on   
to the pillars

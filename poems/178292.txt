The shape of it bending like an eel 
or disfigured quarter moon, pink and green   
and brown, like a rainbow trout. The wall 

along my bed covered with the map I cut   
from the newspaper, and next to it the fishing   
calendar from Abonauder’s Texaco. The square 

cages of days with their numerals and effigies   
of moon and fish shaded to indicate the shape   
of the moon, the hunger of the fish. 

The white bread stripped of its crust, dampened,   
then dusted with flour, compressed into a tight ball,   
wrapped in foil and chilled all night. 

A piece of it pressed and shaped on the tip 
of an Eagle Claw hook, then lowered into the nesting holes   
of blue gill. The plastic bobber floating 

on the surface like a silent doorbell. A whole world 
of cause and effect, framed day-by-day and week-by-week.   
The passage of time as a kind of game in which 

I transferred numbers from the newspaper 
to the calendar. The body counts and their categories   
of NVRA, Marines, Montagnards. 

And each morning I put a bold X through the previous 
day not to erase or forget it but to connect 
the corners, make four triangles of the square. 

And it was rare if not impossible to catch   
the blue gill that swam and swam around   
the tidy pebble craters of their nests, 

or coax them out except in hostile swerves   
and feints toward the bait that hung   
like a balloon of gravity over their homes, 

a suspicious egg pouch or cocoon, something   
a storm might have dislodged from the bank   
and blown like a feared gift into the water, 

a thing swallowed whole then run with 
until the line played out and the hook set fast.

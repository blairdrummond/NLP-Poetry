title : Wasps' Nest

author : Michael Schmidt

text : 
It was the fruit I wanted, not the nest. 
The nest was hanging like the richest fruit 
against the sun. I took the nest

and with it came the heart, and in my hand 
the kingdom and the queen, frail surfaces, 
rested for a moment. Then the drones

awoke and did their painful business. 
I let the city drop upon the stones. 
It split to its deep palaces and combs.

It bled the insect gold,
the pupa queens like tiny eyes
wriggled from their sockets, and somewhere

the monarch cowered in a veil of wings 
in passages through which at evening 
the labourers had homed,

burdened with silence and the garden scents.
The secret heart was broken suddenly.
I, to whom the knowledge had been given,

who was not after knowledge but a fruit, 
remember how a knot of pains 
swelled my hand to a round nest;

blood throbbed in the hurt veins 
as if an unseen swarm mined there. 
The nest oozed bitter honey.

I swaddled my fat hand in cotton. 
After a week pain gave it back to me 
scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin.

A second fruit is growing on the tree.
Identicalâ€”the droning in the leaves.
It ripens. I have another hand.

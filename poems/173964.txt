title : Dirge in Woods

author : George Meredith

text : 
A wind sways the pines, 
         And below 
Not a breath of wild air; 
Still as the mosses that glow 
On the flooring and over the lines 
Of the roots here and there. 
The pine-tree drops its dead; 
They are quiet, as under the sea. 
Overhead, overhead 
Rushes life in a race, 
As the clouds the clouds chase; 
         And we go, 
And we drop like the fruits of the tree, 
         Even we, 
         Even so.

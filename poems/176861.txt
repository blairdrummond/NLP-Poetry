title : Under the Greenwood Tree

author : William Shakespeare

text : 
Vnder the greene wood tree,
      who loues to lye with mee,
      And turne his merrie Note,
      vnto the sweet Birds throte:
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
      Heere shall he see no enemie,
But Winter and rough Weather.

Who doth ambition shunne,
      and loues to liue i' th Sunne:
      Seeking the food he eates,
      and pleas'd with what he gets:
Come hither, come hither, come hither,
      Heere shall he see no enemie,
But Winter and rough Weather.

The generalissimo’s glands directed him 
to and fro. Geronimo! said the über-goon 
we called God, and we were off to the races. 
Never mind that we could only grow 
gray things, that inspecting the horses’ gums 
in the gymnasium predicted a jagged 
road ahead. We were tired of hard news— 
it helped to turn down our hearing aids. 
We could already all do impeccable imitations 
of the idiot, his insistent incisors working on 
a steak as he said there’s an intimacy to invasion. 
That much was true. When we got jaded 
about joyrides, we could always play games 
in the kitchen garden with the prisoners. 
Jump the Gun, Fine Kettle of Fish and Kick 
the Kidney were our favorites. The laws 
the linguists thought up were particularly 
lissome, full of magical loopholes that 
spit out medals. We had made the big time, 
but night still nipped at our heels.   
The navigator’s needle swung strangely, 
oscillating between the oilwells 
and ask again later. We tried to pull ourselves 
together by practicing quarterback sneaks 
along the pylons, but the race to the ravine 
was starting to feel as real as the R.I.P.’s 
and roses carved into rock. Suddenly the sight 
of a schoolbag could send us scrambling.

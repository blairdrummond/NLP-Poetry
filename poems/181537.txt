title : The Pond

Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish, 
and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim. 
But early this spring two Canada geese 
lingered, then built a nest. What I’d 
heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings, 
as they paddle about, grabbed from below 
by a snapper, pulled down to drown. 
                                                                   So he stuck 
hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks 
attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys. 
The first week he caught three turtles 
and still there are more: sometimes he finds 
the bottles dragged ashore, the wire 
wrapped several times around a pine trunk 
and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.

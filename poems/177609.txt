title : Dear Friend

What will be served for our reception 
in the devastation? Finger food, of course 
and white wine, something printed on the napkins. 

We were not children together 
but we are now. Every bird knows 
only two notes constantly rearranged. 

That’s called forever so we wear pajamas 
to the practice funeral, buckeroos 
to the end. We make paper hats 
of headlines and float them away. 

My home made of smoke, 
tiny spider made of punctuation, 
my favorite poem is cinder 
scratched into a sidewalk. 

My friend’s becoming the simplest man, 
he sees a lesson in everything, 
in missing his train, 
in his son hollering from the ﬁrst branch, 
Dad, guess where I am. 

I was with him for my ﬁrst magpies, 
governmental and acting like hell. 
And the new nickel 
with Washington hard to recognize. 

We’d driven by a Rabbit flattened 
by an upset truck, jars of Miracle Whip 
broken over the toll road in heavy snow. 

We watched an old lady 
eat a hot dog in a bun 
with a knife and fork. 

A few emeralds winged off 
a fruit leaf. 

What happens when your head splits open 
and the bird flies out, its two notes deranged? 
You got better, I got better, 
wildflowers rimmed the crater, 
glitter glitter glitter. 

We knew someone whose father died 
then we knew ourselves. 
Astronomer, gladiator, 
thief, a tombstone salesman. 

All our vacations went to the sea 
that breathed two times a day 
without a machine. 
We got in trouble with a raft 
doing what we promised not to. 

Further out to be brought further back. 

There’s my friend in his squashed hat 
trying to determine if a dot 
is a living thing and do no harm. 

He’s having trouble remembering street names 
but there’s still plenty of Thoreau. 

All that a human is made of is gold, 
very very little gold.

title : The Last Canto

author : Brian Culhane

text : 
In the garrulous present 
Threadbare nouns find 
What raiment’s left 
From forefathers 

Who perhaps struck poses 
But wrote of frenzy 
Out of deepest urgency 
Hammering voices 

In no dumbfounded age. 
Theirs the grace 
Of unfaltering 
Fealty to the word. 

Yet then I picture Pound 
Prematurely stilled 
By his own tongue 
—Tempus tacendi. 

Did he ever revisit 
The barbed floodlit quad 
Where bareheaded he’d 
Stood in all weather 

Mouthing surreal Greek, 
Fashioning a rhythm 
Out of life’s ruin, 
That life he would unspeak 

Half a lifetime later 
Arriving on the tarmac 
Of Eisenhower Italy, 
Breath caught in the throat? 

I heft his burdened book 
Only to let it drop 
—A stoneweight dropping down 
Well’s jaggy darkness 

That anyhow comes back 
In stonecold dialect: 
Pisa! A pure echo 
Purged of memory. 

On my lap his poems’ 
Esoteric call 
Has no words at all 
Or just those selfsame ones 

Quarried from a rock 
—Red and ocher bison 
Emblaze the solitude 
Of an old draughtsman 

Who long hours daubs 
In Altamira’s shade: 
Let those I love try to forgive 
What I have made.

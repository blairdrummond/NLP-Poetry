title : Linnaeus in Lapland

author : Lorine Niedecker

text : 
Nothing worth noting 
except an Andromeda 
with quadrangular shoots— 
            the boots 
of the people 

wet inside: they must swim 
to church thru the floods 
or be taxed—the blossoms 
            from the bosoms 
of the leaves 


* 


Fog-thick morning— 
I see only 
where I now walk. I carry 
            my clarity 
with me. 


* 


Hear 
where her snow-grave is 
the You 
            ah you 
of mourning doves

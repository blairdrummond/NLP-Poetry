title : A Summer Wind

author : Michael Field

text : 
O wind, thou hast thy kingdom in the trees, 
        And all thy royalties 
        Sweep through the land to-day. 
              It is mid June, 
And thou, with all thy instruments in tune,
              Thine orchestra
Of heaving fields and heavy swinging fir, 
              Strikest a lay 
              That doth rehearse 
Her ancient freedom to the universe. 
        All other sound in awe 
              Repeats its law: 
        The bird is mute; the sea 
        Sucks up its waves; from rain 
        The burthened clouds refrain, 
To listen to thee in thy leafery, 
              Thou unconfined, 
Lavish, large, soothing, refluent summer wind.

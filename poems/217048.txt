text : 
I wait for my shadow to forget me, 
to take that one phantom step that I keep 
from taking. I wait for the simple flash 
of a dancer's spat upon this one moon 
of stage-light, the mind's lonely oval 
illuminated on the surface of some 
windless pond or slew. And the old soft-shoe 
practices to get it right, husha-husha-hush 
in its constant audition of sawdust. 
Even this choreography of useless 
wishing is not enough to keep tonight 
from becoming nothing more than some floor's 
forgotten routine where faded, numbered 
dance-steps silently waltz themselves away. 
The orchestra's now ready to Fauré
into the evening's last song while I try 
to convince myself to cross this room 
for the first time all night and rinse 
what's left in some débutante's silver 
sequined waterfall, hope keeling hopelessly 
ever closer to the edge. Across the floor 
other couples sashay on. A tin flask empties 
itself from asking, the shadow's last chance 
now wasted in some chandelier's dim lust.

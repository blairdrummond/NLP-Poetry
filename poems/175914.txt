title : How Evolution Came to Indiana

author : Philip Appleman

In Indianapolis they drive 
five hundred miles and end up 
where they started: survival 
of the fittest. In the swamps 
of Auburn and Elkhart, 
in the jungles of South Bend, 
one-cylinder chain-driven runabouts fall   
to air-cooled V-4’s, a-speed gearboxes,   
16-horse flat-twin midships engines— 
carcasses left behind 
by monobloc motors, electric starters,   
3-speed gears, six cylinders, 2-chain drive,   
overhead cams, supercharged 
to 88 miles an hour in second gear, the age   
of Leviathan ... 
    There is grandeur in this view of life,   
    as endless forms 
    most beautiful and wonderful 
    are being evolved. 
And then 
the drying up, the panic, 
the monsters dying: Elcar, Cord, 
Auburn, Duesenberg, Stutz—somewhere   
out there, the chassis of Studebakers,   
Marmons, Lafayettes, Bendixes, all   
rusting in high-octane smog, 
ashes to ashes, they 
end up where they started.

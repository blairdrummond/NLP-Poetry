title : Scarecrow on Fire

text : 
We all think about suddenly disappearing.
 The train tracks lead there, into the woods.
 Even in the financial district: wooden doors
 in alleyways. First I want to put something small
 into your hand, a button or river stone or
 key I don’t know to what. I don’t
 have that house anymore across from the graveyard
 and its black angel. What counts as a proper
 goodbye? My last winter in Iowa there was always
 a ladybug or two in the kitchen for cheer
 even when it was ten below. We all feel 
 suspended over a drop into nothingness.
 Once you get close enough, you see what
 one is stitching is a human heart. Another
 is vomiting wings. Hell, even now I love life.
 Whenever you put your feet on the floor
 in the morning, whatever the nightmare,
 it’s a miracle or fantastic illusion:
 the solidity of the boards, the steadiness
 coming into the legs. Where did we get
 the idea when we were kids to rub dirt
 into the wound or was that just in Pennsylvania?
 Maybe poems are made of breath, the way water,
 cajoled to boil, says, This is my soul, freed.

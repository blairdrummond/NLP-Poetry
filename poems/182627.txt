title : Requiem

author : Peter Munro

text : 
The angels I love 
bicker over cod guts and snapper spines. 
They joust for flounder skulls and pick the bones clean, 
screaming. Their harsh, fine voices 
break across my town 
in a language lost to my kind, 
thoughtless in the clear now of now 
without death. Christ, walk down streets paved 
with rain to me and you drown in my choir, 
my angels beating prayer under wing 
which is the want I have not loved 
well. Where did my weather go? Meet me 
where my hidden weather went, 
where praise and rain 
are never spent. 







"Requiem" is from a sequence titled "Hard Weather Prayers."

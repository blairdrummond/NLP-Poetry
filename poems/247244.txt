title : The Descent

author : Fanny Howe

text : 
The descent has deepened 
the interior lengthened

designated ending

Blind

pulled down inside and then 
shot up again

to see east via the plateglass 
a moon a monsoon an ashram


I used time almost wantonly 
in that bald but sensual sky

to give me gusts
and more measurement

not to snap the stars shut 
but Joseph said 
you really ought

to tender how you sail by eye 
your soul is just a length of baby

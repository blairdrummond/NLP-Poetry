It’s a filmstrip afternoon
             and we’re all grateful
    to the humming projector
             in the middle of our desks,
 the closed blinds, the absence of a real adult.
  
 There’s a vague promise of revelation
             from the title
    and the dark, tree-lined streets, the voice
             calling from a house
 carrying within it our freedom not to answer.
  
 Inside another house, a little girl in a pretty dress
             is falling asleep
    at her father’s desk, turning into
             Alice in Wonderland
 as her mind falls down the rabbit holes of grammar.
  
 The Mad Hatter and Jabberwocky
             tell her to lure
    the letters into a trap so they can beat them
             to death with mallets.
 We’d like to see that. Without words
  
 no one could tell us what to do.
             We know grammar is just a byproduct,
    like schizophrenia, of a brain that grew
             too fast for its own good
 and that history is a series of conspiracies
  
 by accidental despots. Mrs. Bradford is
             falling asleep on the wide window ledge,
    her blue polyester pants gapped
             to reveal her white socks
 and pink spotted shins. We try not to look.
  
 The Mad Hatter doesn’t say that the alphabet
             was first used to keep track of property
    or that for centuries people believed
             if women learned to write
 the lost world would never be recovered
  
 or that the Mayans believed
             outsiders wrote things down
    not in order to remember them
             but to free themselves
 into the work of forgetting.
  
 That year Mrs. Bradford taught us about
             the Lewis & Clark expedition
    over and over again. We never learned
             why it mattered so much to her
 or what possible use it could be to anyone.
  
 The professor tells Judy about
             the thousands of words
    Arabs needed for camels and their parts,
             the dozen words Eskimos had for snow,
 and a chimp who learned seven human words.
  
 A voice made visible says:
             magic is a matter of fact to you,
    Every miracle has to have its qualifications,
             reservations, footnotes
 and our heads rise from our desks.
  
 The rest of the year will be a series of
             substitute teachers
    who teach us nothing but footnotes
             and their own reservations.
 Mrs. Bradford dead of a brain tumor.
  
 We sit in our sixth-grade desks with the blinds
             closed against the tree-lined streets
    as the letters of the world rise up
             and, forming a single word,
 eclipse our world and fill our mouths with shadows.

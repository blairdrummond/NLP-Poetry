title : The River at Wolf

author : Jean Valentine

text : 
Coming east we left the animals 
pelican beaver osprey muskrat and snake   
their hair and skin and feathers 
their eyes in the dark: red and green.   
Your finger drawing my mouth. 

Blessed are they who remember 
that what they now have they once longed for. 

A day a year ago last summer 
God filled me with himself, like gold, inside,   
deeper inside than marrow. 

This close to God this close to you: 
walking into the river at Wolf with 
the animals. The snake’s 
green skin, lit from inside. Our second life.

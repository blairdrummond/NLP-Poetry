Beneath the writing on the wall 
is the writing it was designed 

to obscure. The two together 
form a third kind 


2 

There is no writing   
on the wall’s other side 

Perhaps this lack 
constitutes a fourth kind 


3 

Some of the writing on the wall 
will be designed as truth 

some as art 


4 

It is said to represent a mirror 
of everyday life in its time 


5 

“Fabius Naso 
talks through his asshole 
and shits out his mouth” 
for example 


6 

“Foute les Arabes” 
for example 


7 

Certain words and images 
or parts of images 

have been chipped away 
These often turn up for sale 

at sidewalk stalls 
before the walls 

of other cities 


8 

I too have an image for sale 
It’s the image of a poem 

and is to be found 
on the reverse of this sheet

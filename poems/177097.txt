(for Douglas, at one)
Archaic, his gestures 
hieratic, just like Caesar or Sappho 
or Mary’s Jesus or Ann’s Mary or Jane   
Austen once, or me or your mother’s you 

the sudden baby surges to his feet   
and sways, head forward, chin high,   
arms akimbo, hands dangling idle,   
elbows up, as if winged. 

The features of his face stand out   
amazed, all eyes as his aped posture   
sustains him aloft 
                        a step a step a rush   
and he walks, 

Young Anyone, his lifted point of view   
far beyond the calendar. 

What time is it? Firm in time   
he is out of date— 

like a cellarer for altar wines   
tasting many summers in one glass, 

or like a grandmother 
in whose womb her 
granddaughter once 
slept in egg inside 
grandma’s unborn daughter’s   
folded ovaries.

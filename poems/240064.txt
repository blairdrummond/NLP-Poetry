author : Francisco X. Alarcón

text : 
I want a god
as my accomplice
who spends nights
in houses
of ill repute
and gets up late
on Saturdays

a god
who whistles
through the streets
and trembles
before the lips 
of his lover

a god
who waits in line
at the entrance 
of movie houses
and likes to drink
café au lait

a god
who spits 
blood from 
tuberculosis and
doesn’t even have
enough for bus fare

a god 
knocked
unconscious
by the billy club
of a policeman
at a demonstration

a god 
who pisses 
out of fear
before the flaring
electrodes
of torture

a god 
who hurts
to the last
bone and
bites the air
in pain

a jobless god
a striking god
a hungry god
a fugitive god
an exiled god
an enraged god

a god
who longs
from jail
for a change
in the order
of things

I want a 
more godlike 
god

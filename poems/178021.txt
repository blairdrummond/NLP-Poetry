text : 
I returned to a long strand, 
the hammered curve of a bay,   
and found only the secular 
powers of the Atlantic thundering. 

I faced the unmagical 
invitations of Iceland, 
the pathetic colonies 
of Greenland, and suddenly 

those fabulous raiders, 
those lying in Orkney and Dublin   
measured against 
their long swords rusting, 

those in the solid 
belly of stone ships, 
those hacked and glinting 
in the gravel of thawed streams 

were ocean-deafened voices 
warning me, lifted again 
in violence and epiphany. 
The longship’s swimming tongue 

was buoyant with hindsight— 
it said Thor’s hammer swung 
to geography and trade, 
thick-witted couplings and revenges, 

the hatreds and behind-backs 
of the althing, lies and women,   
exhaustions nominated peace,   
memory incubating the spilled blood. 

It said, ‘Lie down 
in the word-hoard, burrow   
the coil and gleam 
of your furrowed brain. 

Compose in darkness.   
Expect aurora borealis   
in the long foray 
but no cascade of light. 

Keep your eye clear 
as the bleb of the icicle, 
trust the feel of what nubbed treasure   
your hands have known.’

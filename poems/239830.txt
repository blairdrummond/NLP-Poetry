title : Rock of My Salvation

author : Mordecai ben Isaac

text : 
Mighty, praised beyond compare,
 Rock of my salvation,
 Build again my house of prayer,
 For Thy habitation!
 Offering and libation, shall a ransomed nation
 Joyful bring
 There, and sing
 Psalms of Dedication!
  
 Woe was mine in Egypt-land,
 (Tyrant kings enslaved me);
 Till Thy mighty, out-stretched Hand
 From oppression saved me.
 Pharaoh, rash pursuing, vowed my swift undoing—
 Soon, his host
 That proud boast
 ’Neath the waves was rueing!
  
 To Thy Holy Hill, the way
 Madest Thou clear before me;
 With false gods I went astray—
 Foes to exile bore me.
 Torn from all I cherished, almost had I perished—
 Babylon fell,
    Ze-ru-ba-bel
 Badest Thou to restore me!
  
 Then the vengeful Haman wrought
 Subtly, to betray me;
 In his snare himself he caught—
 He that plann’d to slay me.
 (Haled from Esther’s palace; hanged on his own gallows!)
 Seal and ring
 Persia’s king
 Gave Thy servant zealous.
  
 When the brave Asmonéans broke
 Javan’s chain in sunder,
 Through the holy oil, Thy folk
 Didst Thou show a wonder—
 Ever full remained the vessel unprofanèd;
 These eight days,
 Lights and praise,
 Therefore were ordainèd.
  
 Lord, Thy Holy Arm make bare,
 Speed my restoration;
 Be my martyr’s blood Thy care—
 Judge each guilty nation.
 Long is my probation; sore my tribulation—
 Bid, from Heaven,
 Thy shepherds seven
 Haste to my salvation!

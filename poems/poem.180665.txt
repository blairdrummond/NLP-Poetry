Sometimes with One I Love 
Walt Whitman 
1819-1892

U.S., Mid-Atlantic
Love, Unrequited Love, Break-ups & Vexed Love



Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturn'd love,
But now I think there is no unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one way or another
(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd,
Yet out of that I have written these songs).

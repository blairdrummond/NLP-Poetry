(excerpt)
Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe,
That hast this wintres wedres overshake,
And driven away the longe nyghtes blake!

   Saynt Valentyn, that art ful hy on-lofte,
Thus syngen smale foules for thy sake:
         Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe, 
         That hast this wintres wedres overshake. 

   Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte,
Sith ech of hem recovered hath hys make;
Ful blissful mowe they synge when they wake:
         Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe 
         That hast this wintres wedres overshake 
         And driven away the longe nyghtes blake!

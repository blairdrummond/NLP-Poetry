Metaphor, Rhymed Stanza, Sonnet

Amazement fills my heart to-night, 
 Amaze and awful fears; 
 I am a ship that sees no light, 
 But blindly onward steers. 
  
 Flung toward heaven's toppling rage, 
 Sunk between steep and steep, 
 A lost and wondrous fight I wage 
 With the embattled deep. 
  
 I neither know nor care at length 
 Where drives the storm about; 
 Only I summon all my strength 
 And swear to ride it out. 
  
 Yet give I thanks; despite these wars. 
 My ship--though blindly blown, 
 Long lost to sun or moon or stars-- 
 Still stands up alone. 
 I need no trust in borrowed spars; 
 My strength is yet my own.

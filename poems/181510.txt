title : A Regret

author : David Trinidad

text : 
Kurt, early 
twenties. Met 
him after 
an AA 
meeting in 
Silverlake 
(November, 
eighty-five). 
I remem- 
ber standing 
with him up- 
stairs, in the 
clubhouse, how 
I checked his 
body out. 
But not who 
approached whom. 
Or what we 
talked about 
before we 
leaned against 
my car and 
kissed, under 
that tarnished 
L.A. moon. 
Drove to my 
place and un- 
dressed him in 
the dark. He 
was smaller 
than me. I 
couldn’t keep 
my hands off 
his ass. Next 
morning, smoked 
till he woke, 
took him back. 
He thanked me 
sweetly. I 
couldn’t have 
said what I 
wanted, though 
must have known. 
Drove home and 
put him in 
a poem 
("November") 
I was at 
the end of. 

Later that 
day it rained 
(I know from 
the poem).

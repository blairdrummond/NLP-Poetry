My first best friend is Awful Ann— 
she socked me in the eye. 
My second best is Sneaky Sam— 
he tried to swipe my pie. 
My third best friend is Max the Rat— 
he trampled on my toes. 
My fourth best friend is Nasty Nell— 
She almost broke my nose. 

My fifth best friend is Ted the Toad— 
he kicked me in the knee. 
My sixth best friend is Grumpy Gail— 
she's always mean to me. 
My seventh best is Monster Moe— 
he often plays too rough. 
That's all the friends I've got right now— 
I think I've got enough.

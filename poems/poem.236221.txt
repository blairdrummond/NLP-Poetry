Forever - is composed of Nows - 
'Tis not a different time - 
Except for Infiniteness - 
And Latitude of Home - 

From this - experienced Here - 
Remove the Dates - to These - 
Let Months dissolve in further Months - 
And Years - exhale in Years - 

Without Debate - or Pause - 
Or Celebrated Days - 
No different Our Years would be 
From Anno Dominies -

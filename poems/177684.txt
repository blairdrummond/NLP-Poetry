OUR PATRON OF FALLING SHORT, 
WHO BECAME A PRAYER 

I used to sneak into the movies without paying.   
I watched the stories but I failed to see the dark. 
I went to college and drank everything they gave me,   
and I never paid for any of that water 
on which I drifted as if by grace until 
after the drownings, when in the diamond light 
of seven-something A.M., as the spring was tearing   
me up in Cartajena, only praying 
on my knees before the magnifying ark 
of the Seventh St. Hotel could possibly save me,   
until falling on my face before the daughter   
of money while the world poured from the till 
brought the moment’s length against the moment’s height,   
and paying was what I was earning and eating and wearing.   
This to the best of my recollection 
my uncle said in 1956, 
moving against my father like a bear 
on fire as the evening of his visit 
killed the rum. He’d come from Alaska 
or some place like that, the Antarctic, maybe,   
and he left in a hot rage, screaming by the door   
that nothing would save me from my awful father,   
just as he, my uncle, had been saved 
by nothing. Thirteen weeks from then, he died.   
“This family’s full of the dead,” my father told me.   
I was eight. I used to make excuses 
to join him in the washroom as he bathed   
in the mornings, soaping himself carefully   
so as not to splash the automatic pistol   
wrapped in plastic he rested near to hand. 
At a certain point, the sun came through the blinds   
and shafted the toilet bowl, filling it with light   
as he spoke of killing everyone, often taking   
the pistol from its wrap and holding its mouth   
against his breast, explaining that no safety   
lay anywhere, unless he should shoot the fear   
that stood up on its hind legs in his heart.   
Such things were always on TV—I thought   
that one world merged in the next, and I resolved   
to win the great Congressional Medal of Honor,   
to make a name on the stage, and die a priest. 

In the war the bullets yanked the fronds 
from palms and the earth ate them up like acid   
before our eyes. When dead men hit the ground   
they came alive, they spoke in tongues, holding   
babies that came from nowhere in their arms.   
We were all afraid of the earth. My father’s fear   
turned it like a plow, delivering 
dogs and bugs, bright music, and a feminine   
whispering of our names. My comrades fled,   
but I was healed by everything that happened,   
the midnight Rapid Transit stations 
of hand grenades made moonlight as I moved   
from life to life, getting off and shouting   
whatever the signs said, getting on again,   
received like lightning, changing everything.   
My body disappeared. The enemy 
knew me as a ghost who dropped a shadow   
the size of night and turned the air to edges.   
I am your grand companion of surprise,   
big-time harbinger canceling everyone’s 
business in a constant dream of all 
the starring roles and franchises the great   
Congressional Medal of Honor winners win.   
Wounded twice, then decorated more   
than any other in my regiment, 
I stood at home plate, vomit on my blouse   
and whiskey in my blood, and heard the dirt   
of my home town falling grain by grain   
out of the afternoon, while everyone’s   
rahrahrahs affected me like silence.   
The mayor handed me a four-by-four- 
inch cardboard box a colonel handed him; 
I threw it at the vast face of the crowd,   
screaming I wanted only the Medal of Honor … 
I lose the thread of my existence here. 
I see me strange and drugged against my will,   
telling my life story to a room, 
traveling the aisles of an asylum 
out there in Maine, among the aborigines.   
They must have set me loose, or I escaped:   
I see myself in a forest-bordered field,   
unchanged and wearing my uniform— 
free; yet somehow jailed by old desires   
and saying what a soldier says: For home, 
nothing. Comrades, for you, these hoarded rations. 

With four monstrosities in uniforms   
like mine, I pulverized guitars and wept   
for the merriment of many. Brothers, 
when shadows lengthen, and they lower down   
the American flag and close our government,   
another country rises like a mist   
by garbagey coliseums on the warehouse   
side of town to listen to that rock   
and roll: God speaking with the Devil’s voice,   
unbreathable air of manacles, a storm 
to bless your multicolored lips with sperm. 
We sundered them until they brought their bones   
forth from the flesh and laid them at our feet,   
screaming their lungs shut tight as fists,   
shedding their homes forever, leaving name   
and tongue and mind and sending us their heads   
through the mails in the night. We ran it past the edge,   
we gave them something everyone could dance to— 
whatever is most terrible is most real— 
the Bible fights, the fetuses burning in light-bulbs,   
the cunnilingual, intravenous 
swamp of love. Three times I died on stage,   
and the show went on while doctors snatched   
me back from Chinatown with their machines.   
We struck it rich. Without a repertoire,   
without a name or theme, we toured the land   
and eighty thousand perished. We were real, 
but not one company recorded us: 
everywhere we went they passed a law. 
We toured the land—sweet, burning Texacos,   
the adrenaline darkness palpitates frantically,   
the highway eats itself all night, the radio’s   
wheedling bebop fails in the galactic 
soup near dawn; the Winnebago shimmers,   
everything tastes like puke, the eight-ball   
bursts, nobody 
knows how to drink in this fuckin town … 
One night I heard our music end 
abruptly in the middle of a number 
and looked around me at a gigantic silence.   
I felt the pounding, saw the screams, but all   
was like the long erasure of a wind 
calming and disturbing everything 
on its route through stunned fields of hay. 
My bodyguards tried with huge gentleness to lead   
me off, but I threw myself outside, rolling 
through a part of town I’d never seen— 
the flat gray streets looked Hebrew, and the windows   
held out the paraphernalia of old age,   
porcelain Jesuses gesturing from the shadows   
of porcelain vases, surrounded by medicines.   
A rain began. I strained myself to hear   
the trashcans say their miserable names,   
but nothing. At the brink 
of stardom high over the United States,   
untouchable as God but better known, 
I stumbled over streets that might’ve been rubber,   
deaf as a cockroach, finished as a singer. 

Brothers, I spilled myself along the roads.   
Mold grew on me as I dampened in alleys.   
I began in ignorance. How could I know 
that whoever is grinding up his soul is making   
himself afresh? That the ones who run away   
get nearer all the time? Look here or there,   
it’s always the horizon, the dull edge   
of earth dicing your plan like a potato. 
Does water break the light, or light the water?   
Which do you choose: what is or what is?   
I painted myself black and let that color   
ride through virgins like the penises   
they dream of while their fathers sleep. I lied.   
I cheated like a shark. I robbed the dead.   
Nothing healed me, just as nothing healed   
my uncle of himself—but he was healed,   
while I grew phosphorescent with a kind   
of cancer that I carried like a domino,   
a tiny badge discovering me … 
Oh please my love I want to rock and roll with you   
Feel it feel it 
feel it all night like a shoe … 
Ten years I wasted all I had, and then 
ten years I lived correctly—held a job   
in a factory that made explosions, 
where deafness was an asset. I did well,   
I never missed a day, I polished late, 
honed my skills, received promotions—in the end   
I built explosions for atomic bombs,   
forty-three I built myself, which one of these   
days will deafen you, as I am deafened.   
I wrenched the fraternal orders with my tale   
of sorrowful delinquency—the Elks,   
the Lions, Moose; those animals, they loved   
the crippled rock’n’roller with the heart   
wrung out as empty as his former mind,   
and variously and often they cited me.   
I walked the malls with an expanded chest,   
took my sips with my pinkie cocked,   
firing dry martinis at my larynx 
and yearning for the strength of soul it takes   
to suck a bullet from an actual 
pistol, hating my own drained face 
as I intimidated mirrors, or stood 
in a jail of lies before the Eagle Scouts, 
an alarm clock going off inside an alarm clock   
in a lump of iron inside a lump of iron:   
hating myself for having become my father.   
At night I prayed aloud to God and Jesus   
to place me on a spaceship to the moon— 
leaven, I told Them constantly, my mind   
is tired of me, and I would like to die. 
Take me to ground zero take me to ground zero   
where in the midst of detonation it is useless   
to demonstrate quod erat demonstrandum,   
this was my ceaseless prayer, until my lips   
were muscles and my heart could talk,   
telling it over and over to itself; 
until they fired me and drove me to the edge 
of things, and dumped my prayer into the desert.   
Drinking cactus milk and eating sand,   
I wandered until I saw the monastery   
standing higher and higher, at first a loose   
mirage, but soon more real than I was.   
There I fell on my face, and let light carry   
me into the world—just as my uncle told it   
nine million years ago when I was eight— 
and the prison of my human shape exploded,   
my heart cracked open and the blood poured out 
over stones that got up and walked when it touched them.   
High in the noon, some kind of jet plane winked 
like a dime; I saw it also flashed 
over the vast, perfumed, commercial places   
filled with stupid but well-intentioned people,   
the wreckages and ambushes of love   
putting themselves across, making it pay   
in the margins of the fire, in the calm spaces,   
taken across the dance-floor by a last romance,   
kissing softly in a hallucination strewn   
with bus tickets and an originless music— 
and now death comes to them, a little boy   
in a baseball cap and pyjamas, doing things 
to the locks of the heart … This was my vision.   
Here I saw the truth of the horizon,   
the way of coming and going in this life.   
I never drifted up from my beginning:   
I rose as inexorably as heat. 

Brothers, I reached you, and you took me in.   
You saw me when I was invisible, 
you spoke to me when I was deaf, 
you thanked me when I was a secret, 
and how will I make of myself something   
at this hour when I am already made?   
Never a famous hero, a star, a priest— 
my mind decides a little faster than 
the world can talk, and what I dreamed was only 
the darker sketch of what I would become.   
It’s 1996. I’m forty-eight. 
I am a monk who never prays. I am 
a prayer. The pilgrim comes to hear me;   
the banker comes, the bald janitors arrive,   
the mothers lift their wicked children up— 
they wait for me as if I were a bus, 
with or without hope, what’s the difference? 
One guy manipulates a little calculator,   
speaking to it as to a friend. Sweat   
is delivered from its mascara,   
sad women read about houses … 
and now the deaf approach, trailing the dark smoke 
of their infirmity behind them as they leave it 
and move toward the prayer that everything 
is praying: the summer evening a held bubble, 
every gesture riveting the love, 
the swaying of waitresses, the eleven television 
sets in a storefront broadcasting a murderer’s face— 
these things speak the clear promise of Heaven.

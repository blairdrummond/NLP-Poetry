title : The Paleontologist’s Blind Date

author : Philip Memmer

text : 
You have such lovely bones, he says,
holding my face in his hands, 
 
and although I can almost feel
the stone and the sand 
 
sifting away, his fingers
like the softest of brushes, 
 
I realize after this touch
he would know me 
 
years from now, even
in the dark, even 
 
without my skin.
Thank you, I smile— 
 
then I close the door
and never call him again.

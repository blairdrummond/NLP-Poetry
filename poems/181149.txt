title : To Kill a Deer

author : Carol Frost

text : 
Into the changes of autumn brush 
the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears 
were the tinsel browns. They made her. 
I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples, 
and I shot her. Into the pines she ran, 
and I ran after. I might have lost her, 
seeing no sign of blood or scuffle, 
but felt myself part of the woods, 
a woman with a doeâ€™s ears, and heard her 
dying, counted her last breaths like a song 
of dying, and found her dying. 
I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets, 
then poked her with the gun barrel 
because her eyes were dusty and unreal. 
I opened her belly and pushed the insides 
like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole, 
skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee, 
took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell 
that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes. 
I left her refolded in some briars 
with the last sun on her head 
like a benediction, head tilted on its axis 
of neck and barren bone; head bent 
wordless over a death, though I heard 
the night wind blowing through her fur, 
heard riot in the emptied head.

title : Juan’s Song

author : Louise Bogan

text : 
When beauty breaks and falls asunder   
I feel no grief for it, but wonder. 
When love, like a frail shell, lies broken,   
I keep no chip of it for token. 
I never had a man for friend 
Who did not know that love must end.   
I never had a girl for lover 
Who could discern when love was over.   
What the wise doubt, the fool believes— 
Who is it, then, that love deceives?

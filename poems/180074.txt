title : And as in Alice

author : Mary Jo Bang

text : 
Alice cannot be in the poem, she says, because 
She's only a metaphor for childhood 
And a poem is a metaphor already 
So we'd only have a metaphor 

Inside a metaphor. Do you see? 
They all nod. They see. Except for the girl 
With her head in the rabbit hole. From this vantage, 
Her bum looks like the flattened backside 

Of  a black and white panda. She actually has one 
In the crook of  her arm. 
Of course it's stuffed and not living. 
Who would dare hold a real bear so near the outer ear? 

She's wondering what possible harm might come to her 
If  she fell all the way down the dark she's looking through. 
Would strange creatures sing songs 
Where odd syllables came to a sibilant end at the end. 

Perhaps the sounds would be a form of  light  hissing. 
Like when a walrus blows air 
Through two fractured front teeth. Perhaps it would 
Take the form of a snake. But if a snake, it would need a tree. 

Could she grow one from seed? Could one make a cat? 
Make it sit on a branch and fade away again 
The moment you told it that the rude noise it was hearing was 
         rational thought 
With an axe beating on the forest door.

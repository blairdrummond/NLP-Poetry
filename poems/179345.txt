title : The Abandoned Farm

In the northwest corner of Dakota, I saw a room 
someone had left, a plush sofa returning its button-
eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder, 
the dog, too, turning. In the next room, the mattress,
with mattress stories one after another tumbling 
out of each spring, the window she opened first thing, 
its vista of mile after mile, and the windmill hauling 
its load. 
                        I saw that, and nothing alive—

green oil-figured linoleum laid on counters,
nails of bad craft, the ripped blackening edge 
that scared her more than the bed and the sound 
of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer 
night after night, the whack of her blade on the block. 
There are houses with too many knives sometimes she said, 

but when June ferned its way in she'd relent, take on its 
restraint, heave again on the stained sheets her burden 
of child, herself a torn girl again, combing her hair 
through fingers bruised by corn shocks, sweet juice 
in the cuts of her life.

                                                             She began to think of the border 
and mustangs without brand. At night they'd bend 
over the bed and nuzzle. One ride was enough. 
She had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare 
over the windowsill. I see where the curtain fell 
and nobody mended the tear, I see where bare feet 
marked like fossils her pass in the rain.

When he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring,
why does he always think of that first sight 
of her thigh in the peach-colored dress, of his hand's
searching moss with its red-gold stamens, the spring 
in that arid landscape like something from Canaan 
under his tongue? Even in old age he'd ponder the moment,
lying under the moon forgiving himself, her, the world 
that bred their conundrum, washed in that rain.

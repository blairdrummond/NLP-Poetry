title : Gone

author : Then

text : 
Gone then risen
  
 Milk dawn gone then risen
  
 Our ephemeral fawning done
  
 Gone sanguine then risen in spell
  
 High with your wrist while nihil busy
  
 Unburrowing dice teams from sand figurines
  
 Risen to swirl steam scooping passing seemingly
  
 A kindred-ided up and up, born of dormant corners
  
 Forms filial then filled          Goes mourn and swoon
  
 Love have and love loom                    Union and risen

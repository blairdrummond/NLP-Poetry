title : Words for a Young Widow in Maine

author : Norman Williams

text : 
The sinew of the hickory that grips 
The axe, the rasp of salt against the skin, 
Or rockbound earth that shines the steel plough 
In spring, are thought along our coast to lend 
A native character, though none can match 
The force of grief: compare the fisherman’s 
Scored cheeks; the ligaments that rope the necks 
Of lumberjacks; or the farmer’s gnarled wrist— 
Compare these with the widow’s fisted look, 
Then judge who has the most to bear. Think of 
The ghost that each night slips between her sheets 
Or of the sudden joy of being alone 
Which troubles her for weeks. And you, who thought 
Him mean, or too devoted to his drink, 
Consider how the common fingerstones, 
Bathed in the tidal slabs, grow luminous.

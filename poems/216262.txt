title : Count Down

Survival is the final offer
 that arrives at the eleventh hour
 just when pain to the tenth power
 would kill you with another ninth degree.

 By then, relief strikes you brief as an eighth note;
 you wear doom proudly; it's your seventh seal.
 But life whispers through your sixth sense
 of what might await you in some fifth dimension

 where miracle is saved for the fourth quarter.
 Tricked, you sigh and rise on the third day.
 You know better, but with no second thought,
 risk that first step—absurd as first love at first sight—

 as if you were back at ground zero, as if it cost
 nothing, as if this were not the last laugh.

title : The Change

Thirteen years ago,    before bulk barns    and
 fifth gear diesel tractors,    we rode royal blue tractors with
 toolboxes big enough    to hold a six pack on ice.
 In the one hundred fifteen degree    summer
 heat    with air    so thick with moisture
 you drink as you breathe.
 Before the year dusters sprayed
 malathion over our clustered bodies,    perspiring
 while we primed bottom lugs,
 those ground level leaves of tobacco,
 and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled
 eight-inch balls off our arms at night    and
 Cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours.
 Before we were poisoned    and
 the hospital thought we had been burned in fires,
 at least to the third degree,
 when the raw, oozing hives that 
 covered ninety-eight percent of our bodies
 from the sprays ordered by the FDA
 and spread by     landowners,
 before anyone had seen
 automated machines that top and prime.
 While we topped the lavender
 blooms of many tiny flowers
 gathered into one,    gorgeous.
 By grasping hold below the petals
 with our bare, calloused hands
 and twisting downward, quick, hard,
 only one time,    snapped them off.
 Before edgers and herbicides took
 what they    call weeds,
 when we walked for days
 through thirty acres    and
 chopped them out with hoes.
 Hoes,    made long before    from wood and steel
 and sometimes (even longer ago)
 from wood and deer scapula.
 Before the bulk primers came
 and we primed all the leaves by hand,
 stooped over at the waist for the
 lower ones    and    through the season
 gradually    rising higher     until    we stood
 and worked simultaneously,
 as married to the fields as we were to each other,
 carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh
 leaves under each arm    and    sewing them onto
 sticks four feet long on a looper
 under the shade of a tin-roofed barn,    made of shingle,
 and poking it up through the rafters inside
 to be caught by a hanger    who
 poked it up higher in the rafters    to another
 who held a higher position
 and    so    they filled the barn.
 And the leaves hung down
 like butterfly wings,    though
 sometimes the color of
 luna moths,    or Carolina parakeets,    when just
 an hour ago    they had been
 laid upon    the old wooden
 cart trailers pulled behind
 the orange Allis-Chalmers tractor
 with huge, round fenders and only
 a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox,
 picked by primers    so hot
 we would race through the rows
 to reach the twenty-five gallon
 jugs of water placed throughout
 the field to encourage    and    in attempt to
 satisfy our insatiable thirsts
 from drinking air    which poured
through our pores without breaking
 through to our need    for more
 water    in the sun.
 Sun we imagined to disappear
 yet respected    for growing all things on earth
 when quenched with rains called forth
 by our song     and drumming.
 Leaves, which weeks later,    would be
 taken down and the strings pulled
 like string on top of a large dog-food bag
 and sheeted up into burlap sheets
 that bundled over a hundred pounds
 when we smashed down with our feet,
 but gently smashing,
 then thrown up high    to
 a catcher    on a big clapboard trailer
 pulled behind two-ton trucks and
 taken to market in Fuquay-Varina
 and sold to Philip Morris    and
 Winston-Salem    for around    a buck a pound.
 Leaves cured to a bright leaf,
 a golden yellow with the strongest
 aroma of tobacco barn curing
 and hand grown quality
 before the encroachment of
 big business in the Reagan era
 and the slow murder of method
 from a hundred years before.
 When the loons cried out in
 laughter by the springs and
 the bass popped the surface on
 the pond, early on, next to
 the fields, before that time
 when it was unfashionable to
 transplant each individual baby plant,
the infant tobacco we nurtured, to
transplant those seedlings to each hill
 in the field, the space for that particular plant
 and we watched    as    they would grow.
 Before all of this new age, new way,
 I was a sharecropper in Willow Springs, North Carolina,
 as were you    and we were proud to be Tsa la gi
 wishing for winter    so we could make camp
 at Qualla Boundary    and Oconaluftee
 would be free of tourists and filled with snow
 and those of us who held out forever
 and had no CIBs would be home again
 with our people, while the BIA forgot to watch.
 When we still remembered before even the Europeans,
 working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants
 of their slaves they brought from Africa
 when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the Middle East,
 that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we
 prayed whenever we smoked and
 did not smoke for pleasure    and
 I    was content and free.
 Then they came and changed things
 and you left me for a fancy white girl
 and I waited on the land
 until you brought her back
 in that brand new white Trans Am,
 purchased from our crop,    you gave her
 and left her waiting in a motel.
 The nearest one was forty miles away,
 but    near enough    for you
 and    for her    and I knew    though
 I never spoke a word to you
 about it,    I knew and I kept it to
 myself    to this day    and time    and
 I never let on
 until I left    on our anniversary.
 I drove the pick-up
 down the dirt path    by the empty fields
 and rented a shack for eighty dollars,
 the one with cardboard windows
 and a Gillespie house floor design,
 with torn and faded floral paper on walls
 and linoleum so thin over rotted board
 that the floor gave if you weighed over
 a hundred pounds.    I did not.
 And with no running water of any kind,    or bathroom.
 The one at hilltop,    where I could
 see out across all the fields
 and hunt for meat when I wanted
 and find peace.
 I heard you remarried
 and went into automated farming
 and kept up with America.
 I watched all of you    from the hill
 and I waited for the lavender blooms
 to return    and when it was spring
 even the blooms    had turned white.
 I rolled up my bedroll,    remembering before,
 when the fields were like waves on a green ocean,
 and turned away,    away from the change
 and corruption    of big business on small farms
 of traditional agricultural people,    and sharecroppers.
 Away,    so that I could always    hold this concise image
 of before    that    time    and it
 floods    my memory.

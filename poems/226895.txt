title : Never Seek to Tell thy Love

author : William Blake

text : 
Never seek to tell thy love 
Love that never told can be 
For the gentle wind does move 
Silently invisibly

I told my love I told my love 
I told her all my heart 
Trembling cold in ghastly fears
Ah she doth depart

Soon as she was gone from me 
A traveller came by 
Silently invisibly 
O was no deny

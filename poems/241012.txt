Today in El Paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. The world
 is in a delay. All the political consultants drinking whiskey keep
 their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred
 waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. They jingle
 when she brings them drinks. Outside the giant plate glass windows 
 the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings.
 I feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. Each of the various
 faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. I donâ€™t 
 want to talk on the phone to an angel. At night before I go to sleep
 I am already dreaming. Of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces
 of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings.
 I examine my feelings without feeling anything. I ride my blue bike
 on the edge of the desert. I am president of this glass of water.

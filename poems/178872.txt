text : 
I go to the mountain side 
of the house to cut saplings, 
and clear a view to snow 
on the mountain. But when I look up, 
saw in hand, I see a nest clutched in 
the uppermost branches. 
I don’t cut that one. 
I don’t cut the others either. 
Suddenly, in every tree,   
an unseen nest 
where a mountain   
would be.

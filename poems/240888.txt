title : The Round World

author : Rosmarie Waldrop

text : 
nature’s inside, says Cézanne and
 frightening 
 I do not like the fleshy
 echo
  
  
 even so, it is
  
  
 after this close proof
 vision is made
 of matter
  
  
 another mirror
  
  
 it’s possible
 the eye knows
 even where there should have been a lake
  
  
 this optic an illusion
 look 
 at the cat, his changing 
 shapes
 a habit
  
  
 light
 color
 composition
  
  
 the subject more than meets the
 situation, always
 looking 
 at our own eye

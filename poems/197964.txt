text : 
anyone lived in a pretty how town 
(with up so floating many bells down) 
spring summer autumn winter 
he sang his didn’t he danced his did. 

Women and men(both little and small) 
cared for anyone not at all 
they sowed their isn’t they reaped their same 
sun moon stars rain 

children guessed(but only a few 
and down they forgot as up they grew 
autumn winter spring summer) 
that noone loved him more by more 

when by now and tree by leaf 
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone’s any was all to her 

someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance 
(sleep wake hope and then)they 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 
(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down) 

one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face) 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was 

all by all and deep by deep 
and more by more they dream their sleep 
noone and anyone earth by april 
wish by spirit and if by yes. 

Women and men(both dong and ding) 
summer autumn winter spring 
reaped their sowing and went their came 
sun moon stars rain

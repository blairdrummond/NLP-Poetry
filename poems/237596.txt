title : The Story of Light

Think of the woman who first touched fire
to a hollow stone filled with seal oil,
 how she fiddled with fuel and flame
 until blue shadows before and after her
 filled her house, crowded
 the underground, then
 fled like sky-captains
 chasing the aurora’s whale tale
 green beyond the earth’s curve.
 Her tenth summer, the elders let her
 raise her issum, seal pup orphaned
 when hunters brought in her mother,
 their grins of plenty
 broad, red. The women
 slit the hard belly.
 Plopped among the ruby innards
 steaming on rough-cut planks
 blinked a new sea-child
 whose first sound
 came out a question
 in the old language, a question
 that in one throaty bark
 asked who, meaning What family
 is this? What comfort
 do you provide for guests?
 Do you let strangers remain
 strangers? The women rinsed the slick pup
 in cool water, crafted a pouch
 for her to suck. Then the young girl
 whose hands held light
 even when the room did not
 brought this new being
 beside her bed, let it scatter
 babiche and split birch
 gathered for snowshoes, let it
 nose the caribou neck hairs
 bearding her dance fans. They
 held up the fans to their foreheads,
 playing white hair, playing old.
 In the time when women do not sew
 the seal danced at her first potlatch.
 And when the lamps burned down,
 no one could see
 any difference between waves
 in rock, waves in sea.
 The pup lifted her nose, licked
 salt from seven stars, and slipped
 light back among silvers and chum
 light among the ghostly belugas
 swimming far north to offer themselves.

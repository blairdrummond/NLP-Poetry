title : Furthermore

author : Christina Davis

text : 
It was something to let him go.

          It was a having to believe, furthermore,

in the voyage
of the other, a Ulysses

without an Ithaca,

was to speak 
of the sea 
without speech 
of the shore—

and to have for a body

the going away of the body, to have for eyes 
the going away of the eyes. And for hearing,

a silence, where once 
were people.

And for comfort, a dwelling
before each
steps into that weather
of which all
strangers speak.

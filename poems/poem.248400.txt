Rhymed Stanza

Although you hide in the ebb and flow 
Of the pale tide when the moon has set, 
The people of coming days will know 
About the casting out of my net, 
And how you have leaped times out of mind 
Over the little silver cords, 
And think that you were hard and unkind, 
And blame you with many bitter words.

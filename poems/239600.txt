text : 
where the route of a ship bringing tax grain from the provinces is described
  
 where perceived hindering—say, birds congregating on a runway
  
 where the first request was for fertilizer and seeds
  
 where the instruction—harness these to the benefit of your society
  
 where the conscription continued
  
 where boards of revenue
  
 where basically, everyone had a plant job
  
 where preventable diseases rampant
  
 where the need is window screens and sewer covers
  
 where for the good of the very few and the suffering of a great many

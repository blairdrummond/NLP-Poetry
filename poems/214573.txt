title : At the Beach

author : Elizabeth Alexander

Looking at the photograph is somehow not 
unbearable: My friends, two dead, one low 
on T-cells, his white T-shirt an X-ray 
screen for the virus, which I imagine 
as a single, swimming paisley, a sardine 
with serrated fins and a neon spine. 

I’m on a train, thinking about my friends 
and watching two women talk in sign language. 
I feel the energy and heft their talk 
generates, the weight of their words in the air 
the same heft as your presence in this picture, 
boys, the volume of late summer air at the beach. 

Did you tea-dance that day? Write poems 
in the sunlight? Vamp with strangers? There is 
sun under your skin like the gold Sula 
found beneath Ajax’s black. I calibrate 
the weight of your beautiful bones, the weight 
of your elbow, Melvin, 

                                  on Darrell’s brown shoulder.

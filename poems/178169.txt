title : The Education of a Poet

author : Leslie Monsour

text : 
Her pencil poised, she's ready to create, 
Then listens to her mind's perverse debate 
On whether what she does serves any use; 
And that is all she needs for an excuse 
To spend all afternoon and half the night 
Enjoying poems other people write.

Black Stone on a White Stone

I will die in Paris with a rainstorm, 
on a day I already remember, 
I will die in Paris--and I don't shy away-- 
perhaps on a Thursday, as today is, in autumn. 

       It will be Thursday, because today, Thursday, as I prose 
these lines, I've put on my humeri in a bad mood,   
and, today like never before, I've turned back, 
with all of my road, to see myself alone. 

       Cesar Vallejo has died; they kept hitting him,   
everyone, even though he does nothing to them, 
they gave it to him hard with a club and hard 

       also with a rope; witnesses are 
the Thursday days and the humerus bones,   
the solitude, the rain, the roads. . .

title : Dan Emmett Writes “Dixie,” 1859

author : Rachel Richardson

text : 
He started with the tune his mother had hummed
 in Ohio, nostalgia he’d carried for years,
 and by Sunday afternoon he had the words.
 A triumph, already; he whistled the banjo’s part.
  
 (Himself a sympathizer from the North,
 called copperhead, called traitor by his own kin.)
  
 Something lively, some git-up-and-git they’d wanted
 and didn’t he deliver—
 Miss Susan got seven encores the first night.
 That gave them their tune, their Negro walk-around—
  
 Look away, look away, look away, they sang.
 Vipers, that spring, spread thick on the ground.

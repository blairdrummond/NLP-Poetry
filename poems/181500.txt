There, garland dandelions round that idol 
with a corn husk face &  beard 
patched with rat stubble from a barber’s dust pan, 

parade float driven by a carriage pulled by a pig. 
Two sticks knotted together, 
cake frost on that crude wood to make it gilt. 

There, spider cranks &  iron gyres, 
blueberry stain glass sprout 
like wings from coal burn cars, 

a trumpet toots the sorrow of another boy dead, 
there he is, limp on a gurney wrapped in gingham scrap, 
there, he’s blast. 

There, roofless houses, 
sarong utopias balloon, balloon toward the sky, 
while women beat, beat their skulls. 

I trail behind, mop in hand, 
sloshing scum water over memorials. 
There he stares at my tic-torn cankered face, 

&  begs for alms, his face horse rudder red. 
A son, he huffs, it is a son I want. 
I spit into them corned mitt hands.

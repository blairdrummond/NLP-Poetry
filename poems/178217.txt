L’ange Anatomique, by Jacques-Fabien Gautier Dagoty, 1746
Unfastened avidly from each ivory button 
               of her spine, the voluntary muscles open 
virtuosities of red: Cinnabar 

                                    the mutagen, and carmine from cochineal 
               born between fog and frost, so many little 
deaths Buddhists refuse to wear 

                                    robes soaked in its thousands. Sunsets 
               of other centuries fade in galleries to ash. 
Red is fugitive: As the voice, the blow 

                                    of gravity along a nerve opening to an ache 
               the body can’t unhouse: As the carnation 
suffusing cheek and haunch like saucers 

                                    from the king’s porcelain rinsed in candlelight. 
               Gratuitous as the curl, the urn-shaped torso, 
the pensive, brimming gaze of pretty 

                                    post-coital thought she half-turns over one 
               excavated shoulder. As if to see herself 
in a mirror’s savage theater as elegy 

                                    to the attempt to fill an exhausted form, 
               to learn again the old ordeals of wound 
and hand and eye. To find the source of burning.

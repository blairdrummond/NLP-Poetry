Bing Crosby died in Spain
 while playing golf with Franco
 but who could care less, and at this
 writing only a few of
 my dear ones are gone—ah I
 could make a sad list—the swifts,
 as if to prove a point,
 fly into the light and make
 a mockery out of our darkness.
 They scream for food but in
 the world of shadows they only
 make a quick motion; I have
 studied them—the whiter
 the wall is—the barer the bulb—
 the more they scream, the more
 they dip down. I have made
 my two hands into a shape
 and I have darkened the wall
 to see what it looks like—I have
 shortened my two broken fingers
 to make the small tail and twisted
 the knuckles sideways so when
 they come in to eat one shadow
 overtakes the other, that way
 I can live in the darkness
 with Franco's poisonous head
 and Crosby's ears, who fainted,
 a thousand to one, behind a
 number two club, though no swift
 died for him, well, for them,
 digging for clubs. I watch the
 birds every night; they fly
 in a great circle, much larger
 than what I can see, their dipping
 is what I dreaded in front of
 my plain white wall—I say it
 for the nine hundred Americans
 who died in Spain. I thought
 I'd have to wait forever
 to do them a tiny justice
 and listen to their songs
 and die a little from the foolhardy
 mournful words, flying down
 one air current or another
 and doing the sides of buildings
 and tops of trees, the low-lying
 straggling dogwood, the full-bodied
 huge red maple, my dear ones.

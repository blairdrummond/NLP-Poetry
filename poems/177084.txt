title : Beyond the Red River

text : 
The birds have flown their summer skies to the south, 
And the flower-money is drying in the banks of bent grass 
Which the bumble bee has abandoned. We wait for a winter lion, 
Body of ice-crystals and sombrero of dead leaves.

A month ago, from the salt engines of the sea,
A machinery of early storms rolled toward the holiday houses
Where summer still dozed in the pool-side chairs, sipping 
An aging whiskey of distances and departures.

Now the long freight of autumn goes smoking out of the land. 
My possibles are all packed up, but still I do not leave.
I am happy enough here, where Dakota drifts wild in the universe, 
Where the prairie is starting to shake in the surf of the winter dark.

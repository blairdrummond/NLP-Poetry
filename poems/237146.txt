title : vocabulary I

author : Robin Blaser

text : 
let me get the vocabulary of this song
right—the curious happiness of poetry—
the word materialism dropped by the way
side—its mereness of the other face of
spiritualism—just two notes to sing—
repetitious dualism—do—do—once in a while
one squawks louder than the other, baby
crows being weaned before the next batch—
thus, singing, move from how it does matter—
Oh!—a murder of crows

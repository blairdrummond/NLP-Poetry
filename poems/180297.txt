title : from Theme of Farewell

author : Milo De Angelis

text : 
In you all deaths gather, all 
the broken glasses, the sere pages, the derangements 
of thought, they gather in you, guilty 
of all deaths, incomplete and guilty, 
in the wake of every mother, in your wake, 
motionless. They gather there, in your 
weak hands. The apples of this market are death, 
these poems retreat into their grammar, 
in the hotel room, in the hut 
of what does not join, souls without rest, 
aged lips, bark ripped from the trunk. 
They are dead. They gather there. They failed, 
the operation failed, they failed. 


The place was motionless, the word obscure. That was 
the place we agreed on. Goodbye, memory of the sparkling 
nights, goodbye, big smile, the place was there. 
To breathe was a darkness shutters had made, a primitive state. 
Silence and desert were switching positions and we 
were talking to a lamp. The place was that one. The trolleys 
rarely passed. Venus was returning to her hut. 
Out of the warrior throat, episodes broke free. We didn't 
say anything more. The place was that one. It was there 
that you were dying.

title : For Laurel and Hardy on My Workroom Wall

author : David Wagoner

text : 
They’re tipping their battered derbies and striding forward 
    In step for a change, chipper, self-assured, 
         Their cardboard suitcases labeled 
Guest of Steerage. They’ve just arrived at the boot camp 
    Of the good old French Foreign Legion 
         Which they’ve chosen as their slice of life 
Instead of drowning themselves. Once again 
    They’re about to become their own mothers and fathers 
         And their own unknowable children 
Who will rehearse sad laughter and mock tears, 
    Will frown with completely unsuccessful 
         Concentration, and will practice the amazement 
Of suddenly understanding everything 
    That baffles them and will go on baffling them 
         While they pretend they’re only one reel away 
From belonging in the world. Their arrival 
    Will mark a new beginning of meaningless 
         Hostilities with a slaphappy ending. In a moment, 
They’ll hear music, and as if they’d known all along 
    This was what they’d come for, they’ll put down 
         The mops and buckets given them as charms 
With which to cleanse the Sahara and move their feet 
    With a calm, sure, delicate disregard 
         For all close-order drill and begin dancing.

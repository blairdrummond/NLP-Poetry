text : 
I have envied those   
who make something   
useful, sturdy— 
a chair, a pair of boots. 

Even a soup, 
rich with potatoes and cream. 

Or those who fix, perhaps, 
a leaking window: 
strip out the old cracked putty, 
lay down cleanly the line of the new. 

You could learn, 
the mirror tells me, late at night,   
but lacks conviction. 
One reflected eyebrow quivers a little. 

I look at this 
borrowed apartment— 
everywhere I question it, 
the wallpaper’s pattern matches. 

Yesterday a woman 
showed me 
a building shaped 
like the overturned hull of a ship, 

its roof trusses, under the plaster, 
lashed with soaked rawhide, 
the columns’ marble 
painted to seem like wood. 
Though possibly it was the other way around? 

I look at my unhandy hand, 
innocent, 
shaped as the hands of others are shaped.   
Even the pen it holds is a mystery, really. 

Rawhide, it writes,   
and chair, and marble. 
Eyebrow. 

Later the woman asked me— 
I recognized her then, 
my sister, my own young self— 

Does a poem enlarge the world,   
or only our idea of the world? 

How do you take one from the other,   
I lied, or did not lie,   
in answer.

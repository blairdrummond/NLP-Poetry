Symbolist

The buried temple empties through its bowels,
 Sepulchral sewer spewing mud and rubies,
 Abominably some idol of Anubis,
 Its muzzle all aflame with savage howls.
  
 Or if the recent gas the wick befouls
 That bears so many insults, it illumines
 In haggard outline an immortal pubis
 Flying along the streetlights on its prowls.
  
 What wreaths dried out in cities without prayer
 Of night could bless like that which settles down
 Vainly against the marble of Baudelaire
  
 In the fluttering veil that girds her absence round,
 A tutelary poison, his own Wraith,
 We breathe in always though it bring us death.

title : Victims of the Latest Dance Craze

author : Cornelius Eady

text : 
The streamers choking the main arteries 
Of downtown. 
The brass band led by a child 
From the home for the handicapped.   
The old men 
Showing their hair (what’s left of it),   
The buttons of their shirts Popping in time 
To the salsa flooding out 
Of their portable headphones, 

And mothers letting their babies   
Be held by strangers. 
And the bus drivers 
Taping over their fare boxes   
And willing to give directions. 

Is there any reason to mention   
All the drinks are on the house?   
Thick, adolescent boys 
Dismantle their BB guns. 
Here is the world (what’s left of it),   
In brilliant motion, 
The oil slick at the curb 
Danced into a thousand 
Splintered steps. 
The bag ladies toss off their 
Garments 
To reveal wings. 

“This dance you do,” drawls the cop,   
“What do you call it?” 
We call it scalding the air. 
We call it dying with your 
Shoes on. 

And across the street   
The bodies of tramps   
Stumble 
In a sober language. 

And across the street 
Shy young girls step behind   
Their nameless boyfriends,   
Twirling their skirts. 

And under an archway 
A delivery boy discovers 
His body has learned to speak,   
And what does this street look like   
If not a runway, 
A polished wood floor? 

From the air, 
Insects drawn by the sweat   
Alight, when possible, 
On the blur 
Of torsos. 
It is the ride 
Of their tiny lives. 
The wind that burns their wings,   
The heaving, oblivious flesh,   
Mountains stuffed with panic,   
An ocean 
That can’t make up its mind.   
They drop away 
With the scorched taste 
Of vertigo. 

And under a swinging light bulb 
Some children   
Invent a game 
With the shadow the bulb makes, 
And the beat of their hearts. 
They call it dust in the mouth. 
They call it horse with no rider. 
They call it school with empty books. 

In the next room 
Their mother throws her dress away to chance.   
It drops to the floor 
Like a brush sighs across a drum head, 
And when she takes her lover, 
What are they thinking of 
If not a ballroom filled with mirrors, 
A world where no one has the right 
To stumble? 

In a parking lot 
An old man says this: 
“I am a ghost dance. 
I remember the way my hair felt,   
Damp with sweat and wind. 

When the wind kisses the leaves, I am dancing.   
When the subway hits the third rail, I am dancing.   
When the barrel goes over Niagara Falls, I am dancing. 
Music rings my bones like metal. 

O, Jazz has come from heaven,” he says, 
And at the z he jumps, arcing his back like a heron’s neck,   
And stands suddenly revealed 
As a balance demon, 
A home for 
Stetson hats. 

We have all caught the itch: 
The neon artist 
Wiring up his legs,   
The tourist couple   
Recording the twist on their 
Instamatic camera,   
And in a factory, 
A janitor asks his broom 
For a waltz, 
And he grasps it like a woman 
He’d have to live another 
Life to meet, 
And he spins around the dust bin 
And machines and thinks: 
Is everybody happy? 
And he spins out the side door, 
Avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk, 
Grinning as if he’d just received 
The deepest kiss in the world.

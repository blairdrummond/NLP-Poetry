text : 
Where they will bury me 
I don't know. 
Many places might not be 
sorry to store me. 

The Midwest has right of origin. 
Already it has welcomed my mother 
to its flat sheets. 

The English fens that bore me 
have been close curiously often. 
It seems I can't get away from 
dampness and learning. 

If I stay where I am 
I could sleep in this educated earth. 

But if they are kind, they'll burn me 
and send me to Vermont. 

I'd be an education for the trees 
and would relish, really, 
flaring into maple each Octoberâ€” 
my scarlet letter to you. 

Your stormy north is possible. 
You will be there, engrossed in its peat. 

It would be handy not 
to have to cross the whole Atlantic 
each time I wanted to 
lift up the turf and slip in beside you.

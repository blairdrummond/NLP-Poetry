Now here is a typical children’s story   
that happens in gorgeous October   
when the mothers are coming 
in the afternoon, wearing brisk boots   
and windy skirts to pick up 
the little children from the day care center 

Frost in the air 
the maples golden and crimson 
my son in a leaf pile in the playground dreaming   
I am late, the playground is almost 
empty, my husband will kill me 

I gather my son to go home, 
he forgets his sweater in the playground and I send him back   
he dawdles, he is playing with leaves 
in his mind, it is already a quarter 
to six, will you come on I say 

and hurry along the corridor, there are yellow and blue rocket   
paintings, but I feel bad and ask what did you do today,   
do you recognize this story, the way he stands and picks   
his nose, move I say, do you want dinner or not   
I’m going to make a nice dinner, fried chicken 
I wheedle, so could you please walk a little 
faster, okay, I walk a little faster and get upstairs   
myself, pivot on boot-heel, nobody there, 
he is putting something in his mouth, his sable eyelashes   
downcast, and I am swooping down the stairwell screaming 

         damn you   
         that’s filthy 
         I told you not before dinner 

We are climbing the stairs 
and I am crying, my son is not crying 
I have shaken him, I have pried the sweet from his cheek   
I have slapped his cheek like a woman slapping a carpet   
with all my strength 

         mothers are very strong 
         he is too young to do anything about this   
         will not remember he remembers it 

The mind is a leaf pile where you can bury 
anything, pain, the image of a woman 
who wears a necklace of skulls, a screaming woman   
you dig quickly and deposit the pulpy thing 
you drop leaves on it and it stays there, that is the story 

that is sticking in my mind as we push 
the exit door, and run through the evening wind   
to my car where I jerk the gearshift and pick   
up a little speed, going along 
this neat suburban avenue full of maples 
the mark of my hand a blush on my son’s cheek.

title : The Domestic Life of Ghosts

author : Tom Clark

text : 
Whoso list to haunt could do worse than to 
Obtain the license, get the picture. 
Spook finders must find spooks to put the face, 
Name and space coordinates together. 
What is kept in the mind perimeter 
Retains a wild autonomy through fate. 

I will retreat to the precorporate. 
Let fate have what is fate’s and allow 
This spirit to slip through time’s difficult 
Nets with the devious fingers of 
A wild wind, while I run along behind.

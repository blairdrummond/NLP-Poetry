title : Leave-Taking

author : Louise Bogan

text : 
I do not know where either of us can turn 
Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. 
I do not know how we can bear 
The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 
Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 
We shall wish not to be alone 
And that love were not dispersed and set freeâ€” 
Though you defeat me, 
And I be heavy upon you. 

But like earth heaped over the heart 
Is love grown perfect. 
Like a shell over the beat of life 
Is love perfect to the last. 
So let it be the same 
Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; 
Let us know this for leavetaking, 
That I may not be heavy upon you, 
That you may blind me no more.

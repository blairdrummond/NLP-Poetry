What did I know, what did I know
Of gazing silences and terrored stone

Brilliances; beauty of whatâ€™s hardbitten
The auroral darkness which is God

Then you arrived, meditative, ironic
My head gripped in bony vice

Mouth of agony shaping a cry it cannot utter
What did I know, what did I know

Of a changing permanence
The stains and dirty tools of struggle

Weaving a wish and a weariness together
Years before your time. Years and years

I gaze through layered light
Within the rock of the undiscovered suns

I see, I walk with you among
The landscape lush, metallic, flayed

Behind us, beyond us now
The very sunlight here seems flammable

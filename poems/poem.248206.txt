"No one cares less than I,
 Nobody knows but God,
 Whether I am destined to lie
 Under a foreign clod,"
 Were the words I made to the bugle call in the morning.
  
 But laughing, storming, scorning,
 Only the bugles know
 What the bugles say in the morning,
 And they do not care, when they blow
 The call that I heard and made words to early this morning.

title : Elusive Time

author : James Laughlin

text : 
In love it may be dangerous   
to reckon on time to count 

on it time’s here and then   
it’s gone   I’m not thinking 

of death or disaster but of   
the slippage the unpredictable 

disappearance of days on which   
we were depending for happiness.

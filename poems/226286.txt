title : Song of Three Smiles

author : W. S. Merwin

text : 
Let me call a ghost,   
Love, so it be little:   
In December we took 
No thought for the weather. 

Whom now shall I thank   
For this wealth of water?   
Your heart loves harbors   
Where I am a stranger. 

Where was it we lay 
Needing no other 
Twelve days and twelve nights   
In each other’s eyes? 

Or was it at Babel 
And the days too small   
We spoke our own tongue   
Needing no other? 

If a seed grow green   
Set a stone upon it   
That it learn thereby   
Holy charity. 

If you must smile 
Always on that other, 
Cut me from ear to ear   
And we all smile together.

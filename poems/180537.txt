title : callas lover

author : D. A. Powell

text : 
this is the track I've had on REPEAT all afternoon:      she is butterfly 
brilliant riband, rice flour face, silken, even her voice a sashed kimono 

                             if I were foolish like her:    
                                          but aren't I foolish like her 
                             spotting the coil of smoke and the billowed sail 
                   against the verge of sky 

simple on the rise surveying the anchorage:      simple me, signal me 
dreading the confident assumption of return, dreading more 
uncertain tone to come, the thinning notes, performance 
too close to my own impatient—swells, a surge:      sick wind 

but the emotion is, after all, an artfully conjured gesture 
arranged marriage between a past ache and frail woodwinds 
                             I could skip ahead 
                                          could break the inconsolable loop 
of harbor, waiting, overlook, waiting, inevitable waning eye 

troubled robins, once more in the handkerchief trees 
once more, brief aquarelle of triplet lilies, blue as willowware   
in that interval before his embrace falters, stuck, founders 
              [shuffle play]    such a pitch of tenderness in the voice 
                             such an awful lot of noise

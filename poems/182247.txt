title : Makris Is Fallen

author : Sarah Lindsay

text : 
The dog came back, 
grinning and smelling of carrion, 
and her husband behind it, stride and gestures 
too large for the house. His field voice, cracking, 
declared a wider kingdom, 
and the name of a fallen city, 
not theirs this time. 
From outside the roar and shrill 
of celebration poured in. 
He drew near in a rank cloud, breathing hard, 
to show her the gash in his thumb. 
So she washed in five waters and went to their bed, 
but he slept without moving, 
still in his cloak and dust.

The Moon is distant from the Sea - 
And yet, with Amber Hands - 
She leads Him - docile as a Boy - 
Along appointed Sands - 

He never misses a Degree - 
Obedient to Her eye - 
He comes just so far - toward the Town - 
Just so far - goes away - 

Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand - 
And mine - the distant Sea - 
Obedient to the least command 
Thine eye impose on me -

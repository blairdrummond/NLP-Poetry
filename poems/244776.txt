title : The Second Inaugural

Dear Necessity, the magnitude
             and difficulty of the trust to which the voice
                         of my country has called arises from the recent
 tempest, adopted by the Spanish to name
             the storms they encountered in New Times
                         Roman. These reflections, bracketed
 by floods, have forced themselves
             so strongly on my mind that I fear
                         Hurakan, who commands winds
 from the east. In the night there is a coming
             and going of people, but where are the former
                         ties? Although the wounds of many
 of you have begun to fester,
             there are none under the waters, there are
                         none. In this conflict all I dare aver
 is that it has been my faithful study
             to collect a duty from a just appreciation
                         of every street lamp in Philadelphia. If I
 have violated willingly or silently
             the injunction thereof, I may
                         (besides incurring constitutional punishment) be subject
             to the upbraiding of all who are now
                         witnesses of this present solemnity. I did
 not say, “In this chapter begins your future, it cannot be put out by fire.”

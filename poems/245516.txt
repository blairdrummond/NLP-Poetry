title : Are All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real?

author : Aimee Nezhukumatathil

If by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck
 in your heel, the wetness of a finished lollipop stick, 
the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse— 
then Yes, every last page is true, every nuance, 
bit, and bite. Wait. I have made them up—all of them— 
and when I say I am married, it means I married 
all of them, a whole neighborhood of past loves. 
Can you imagine the number of bouquets, how many 
slices of cake? Even now, my husbands plan a great meal 
for us—one chops up some parsley, one stirs a bubbling pot 
on the stove. One changes the baby, and one sleeps 
in a fat chair. One flips through the newspaper, another 
whistles while he shaves in the shower, and every single 
one of them wonders what time I am coming home.

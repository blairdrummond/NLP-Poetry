title : Edison in Love

author : Robin Ekiss

text : 
Thomas Edison loved a doll   
with a tiny phonograph inside   
because he made her speak.   

Is there any other reason   
to love a woman? Did she say    
the ghost of my conception  

or something equally demure?   
It’s hard to be sure how he feels   
when he holds me, I fall apart.    

I’m projecting here. He didn’t feel    
her first transgression   
was in having no expression.    

René Descartes, too, traveled alone    
with a doll-in-a-box   
he called his daughter. Francine, 

Francine... is it better to be silent    
and wait for everything    
we were promised?   

Or should we love them back,    
the way a train loves its destination,    
as if we have the machinery necessary for it?

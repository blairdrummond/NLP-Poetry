Rhymed Stanza

Poet--
Enchanting spirit!--at thy votive shrine 
I lowly bend a simple wreath to twine; 
O Come from the ideal world and fling 
Thy airy fingers o'er my rugged string; 
Sweep the dark chords of thought and give to earth 
The thrilling song that tells thy heavenly birth-- 

Fancy--
Happiness when from earth she fled 
      I passed on her heavenward flight-- 
"Take this crown," the spirit said 
      "Of heaven's own golden light-- 
To the sons of sorrow the token give, 
And bid them follow my steps and live!"-- 

I took the crown from the snowy hand, 
      It flashed like a living star; 
I turned this dark earth to a fairy land 
      When I hither drive my car; 
But I placed the crown round my tresses bright, 
And man only saw its reflected light-- 

Many a lovely dream I've given, 
      And many a song divine; 
But never!--oh never--that gift of heaven 
      Shall mortals temples twine-- 
Hope and love in the circlet glow! 
'Tis all too bright for a world of woe-- 

Poet--
Hist--Beautiful spirit!--why silent so soon? 
My ear drinks each word of thy magical tune; 
My lyre owns thy touch--and its tremulous strings 
Vibrate beneath the soft play of thy wings; 
Resume thy sweet lay, and reveal, ere we part 
Thy home lovely spirit--and say what thou art?"-- 

Fancy--
The gleam of a star thou cans't not see-- 
Of an eye 'neath its sleeping lid, 
The sound of a far off melody 
      The voice of a stream that's hid; 
Such must I still remain to thee 
A wonder and a mystery!-- 

I live in the poet's dream 
      I flash on the painter's eye; 
I dwell in the moon's pale beam, 
      In the depths of the star lit sky; 
I traverse the earth, the air, the main, 
And bind young hearts in my magic chain-- 

I float on the fleecy cloud 
      My voice is in ev'ry breeze; 
I speak in the tempest loud, 
      In the sigh of the waving trees-- 
To the sons of earth--in a mystic tone, 
I tell of a world more bright than their own!--

walking down park   
amsterdam 
or columbus do you ever stop 
to think what it looked like 
before it was an avenue 
did you ever stop to think 
what you walked   
before you rode   
subways to the stock   
exchange (we can’t be on 
the stock exchange   
we are the stock   
exchanged) 

did you ever maybe wonder 
what grass was like before   
they rolled it 
into a ball and called   
it central park 
where syphilitic dogs 
and their two-legged tubercular 
masters fertilize 
the corners and side-walks 
ever want to know what would happen 
if your life could be fertilized 
by a love thought   
from a loved one 
who loves you 

ever look south 
on a clear day and not see 
time’s squares but see 
tall Birch trees with sycamores   
touching hands 
and see gazelles running playfully   
after the lions 
ever hear the antelope bark 
from the third floor apartment 

ever, did you ever, sit down 
and wonder about what freedom’s freedom 
would bring 
it’s so easy to be free 
you start by loving yourself   
then those who look like you   
all else will come 
naturally 

ever wonder why 
so much asphalt was laid 
in so little space 
probably so we would forget   
the Iroquois, Algonquin 
and Mohicans who could caress   
the earth 

ever think what Harlem would be 
like if our herbs and roots and elephant ears   
grew sending 
a cacophony of sound to us 
the parrot parroting black is beautiful black is beautiful   
owls sending out whooooo’s making love ...   
and me and you just sitting in the sun trying 
to find a way to get a banana tree from one of the monkeys   
koala bears in the trees laughing at our listlessness 

ever think its possible 
for us to be 
happy

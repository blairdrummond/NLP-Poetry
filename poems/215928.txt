title : At the Poetry Reading

author : John Brehm

text : 
I can’t keep my eyes off the poet’s 
wife’s legs—they’re so much more 
beautiful than anything he might 
be saying, though I’m no longer 
in a position really to judge, 
having stopped listening some time ago. 
He’s from the Iowa Writers Workshop 
and can therefore get along fine 
without my attention. He started in 
reading poems about his childhood— 
barns, cornsnakes, gradeschool, flowers, 
that sort of stuff—the loss of 
innocence he keeps talking about 
between poems, which I can relate to, 
especially under these circumstances. 
Now he’s on to science, a poem 
about hydrogen, I think, he’s trying 
to imagine himself turning into hydrogen. 
Maybe he’ll succeed. I’m imagining 
myself sliding up his wife’s fluid, 
rhythmic, lusciously curved, black- 
stockinged legs, imagining them arched 
around my shoulders, wrapped around my back. 
My God, why doesn’t he write poems about her! 
He will, no doubt, once she leaves him, 
leaves him for another poet, perhaps, 
the observant, uninnocent one, who knows 
a poem when it sits down in a room with him.

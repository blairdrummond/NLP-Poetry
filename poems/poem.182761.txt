Serenade 
Mary Weston Fordham 
1843-1905

U.S., Southern
Relationships, Nature, Romantic Love



Sleep, love sleep, 
The night winds sigh, 
In soft lullaby. 
The Lark is at rest 
With the dew on her breast. 
So close those dear eyes, 
That borrowed their hue 
From the heavens so blue, 
Sleep, love sleep. 

Sleep, love sleep, 
The pale moon looks down 
On the valleys around, 
The Glow Moth is flying, 
The South wind is sighing, 
And I am low lying, 
With lute deftly strung, 
To pour out my song, 
Sleep, love sleep.

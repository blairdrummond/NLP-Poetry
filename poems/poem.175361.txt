Couplet

What sacramental hurt that brings 
The terror of the truth of things 
Had changed thee? Secret be it yet. 
'T was thine, upon a headland set, 
To view no isles of man's delight, 
With lyric foam in rainbow flight, 
But all a-swing, a-gleam, mid slow uproar, 
Black sea, and curved uncouth sea-bitten shore.

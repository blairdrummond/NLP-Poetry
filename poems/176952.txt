text : 

                     colored pictures 
of all things to eat: dirty 
postcards 
               And words, words, words   
all over everything 
                                              No eyes or ears left   
to do their own doings (all 

invaded, appropriated, outraged, all senses 

including the mind, that worker on what is 
                                                                  And that other sense   
made to give even the most wretched, or any of us, wretched, 
that consolation (greased 
                                        lulled   
even the street-cars

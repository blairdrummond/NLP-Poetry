A Route of Evanescence, (1489) 
Emily Dickinson 
1830-1886

U.S., New, England
Time & Brevity, Living



A Route of Evanescence, 
With a revolving Wheel - 
A Resonance of Emerald 
A Rush of Cochineal - 
And every Blossom on the Bush 
Adjusts it's tumbled Head - 
The Mail from Tunis - probably, 
An easy Morning's Ride -

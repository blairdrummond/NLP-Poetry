title : Two Violins

author : A. E. Stallings

text : 
One was fire red,   
Hand carved and new— 
The local maker pried the wood 
From a torn-down church's pew, 

The Devil's instrument 
Wrenched from the house of God. 
It answered merrily and clear 
Though my fingering was flawed; 

Bright and sharp as a young wine, 
They said, but it would mellow, 
And that I would grow into it. 
The other one was yellow 

And nicked down at the chin, 
A varnish of Baltic amber, 
A one-piece back of tiger maple 
And a low, dark timbre. 

A century old, they said, 
Its sound will never change. 
Rich and deep on G and D, 
Thin on the upper range, 

And how it came from the Old World 
Was anybody's guess— 
Light as an exile's suitcase, 
A belly of emptiness: 

That was the one I chose 
(Not the one of flame)   
And teachers would turn in their practiced hands 
To see whence the sad notes came.

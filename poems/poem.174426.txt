Sonnet

I might!--unhappy word--O me, I might, 
And then would not, or could not, see my bliss; 
Till now wrapt in a most infernal night, 
I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss. 
Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right; 
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his, 
No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight, 
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is; 
But to myself myself did give the blow, 
While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me 
That I respects for both our sakes must show: 
And yet could not by rising morn foresee 
How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes, 
That I had been more foolish,--or more wise!

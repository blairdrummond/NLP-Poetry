Some places you could die in,
                                                 if you could just go on
                                                 living there.
 The boy, his legs bare and small,
 swinging in the stroller, sockless, suede-shoed feet touching
 the runner. He can walk, but the woman
 keeps him from running
 into the street. He won’t obey
 but listens to everything we say. Head tilted, face changing
 with the conversation. Green leaves leap through fences.
 Cars wait while we cross. And each bird the boy greets
 with its name, “Bird,” flies away. The sky holds everything.
  
 The woman pushes her son’s son along. Her arms strong enough
    to hold
 nine strong horses prancing.
 She’s given her money away
 because someone had to bury
 a child. That is the worst thing.
 A mother burying her child.
  
 I would never do that to her, even though it means
 what it means.
 A thousand years from now
 when I am only a dream
 I will dream this dream
 of strolling.
 Perhaps I am doing so now.

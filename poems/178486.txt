Lying asleep walking   
Last night I met my father   
Who seemed pleased to see me.   
He wanted to speak. I saw   
His mouth saying something   
But the dream had no sound. 

We were surrounded by   
Laid-up paddle steamers   
In The Old Quay in Greenock.   
I smelt the tar and the ropes. 

It seemed that I was standing   
Beside the big iron cannon   
The tugs used to tie up to   
When I was a boy. I turned   
To see Dad standing just   
Across the causeway under   
That one lamp they keep on. 

He recognised me immediately.   
I could see that. He was   
The handsome, same age   
With his good brows as when   
He would take me on Sundays   
Saying we’ll go for a walk. 

Dad, what am I doing here?   
What is it I am doing now?   
Are you proud of me?   
Going away, I knew   
You wanted to tell me something. 

You stopped and almost turned back   
To say something. My father,   
I try to be the best   
In you you give me always. 

Lying asleep turning   
Round in the quay-lit dark   
It was my father standing   
As real as life. I smelt   
The quay’s tar and the ropes. 

I think he wanted to speak.   
But the dream had no sound.   
I think I must have loved him.

They have us corralled 
in the basement of the courthouse. 
One desk and a row of folding chairs— 
just like first grade, our desks facing Teacher 
in neat little rows. 

           Upstairs, 
wooden benches like pews and red 
carpet reserved for those who’ve held out 
the longest. No creditors have come to claim us 
today. We’re small-time. 

This guy from the graveyard shift 
stares at his steel-toed boots, nervous hands 
in his lap. None of us look each other 
in the eye. We steal quick looks—how did you 
get here. . .  

chemo bills, a gambling addiction, 
a summer spent unemployed and too many 
cash advances to pay the rent. 
We examine the pipes that hang 
from the ceiling, the scratched tiles on the floor, 

the red glow of the exit sign at the end of the hall 
so like our other failed escapes: 
light of the TV at night, 
glass of cheap Merlot beside a lamp, 
a stop light on the way out of town.

title : Talking among Ourselves

author : Charlie Smith

text : 
In the rental cottage it comes to me,   
how the four lives of myself 
and my brothers 
crisscross 
like tracer bullets, 
and how, from a distance maybe, 
if you had the right kind of glasses,   
there might appear to be a target   
we all were aiming at 
beyond that black escutcheon of cloud   
above Santa Rosa Bay 
as we lie on the deck 
drinking tequila and beer, 
our voices growing vague and weary   
as time passes, until one of us 
tells a story, more cordial than precise,   
about climbing to the top of a magnolia tree   
when he was ten, and falling. The rest of us   
draw closer around the story 
as we watch the great flattened cloud   
raise its triangular wing 
over the state of Florida. It is night   
in Florida 
and, in a moment, one of us will recall   
the time our father, in a gray suit,   
climbed the steps of an airliner   
bound for Paris 
and never came back. And one, or another,   
will tell how our mother, more blond   
and beautiful than ever 
that spring, said, 
You must now be soldiers, 
and screamed and screamed. We will each 
raise his head 
and stare for a moment through the lighted gate 
of the living room window 
at our wives, 
who are putting away the last of the supper dishes,   
speaking among themselves   
with the easy familiarity of women   
whose husbands 
are brothers. And one of us will begin so sing 
an old song 
that our father sang 
before he went away, a song   
about losing a fair woman 
in the foggy, foggy dew, 
and as the late chill rises off the bay   
we will all remember 
what we thought as children 
when we heard him sing of the woman   
who was not, and never could have been, 
our mother 
and of how an emptiness, 
bigger than an ocean, 
opened inside us, and one of us   
will say, I think it is going to rain,   
and we will get up 
and go back inside.

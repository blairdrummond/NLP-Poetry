Rhymed Stanza

In my heart the old love   
   Struggled with the new,   
It was ghostly waking   
   All night through.    

Dear things, kind things   
   That my old love said,   
Ranged themselves reproachfully   
   Round my bed.    

But I could not heed them,   
   For I seemed to see   
Dark eyes of my new love   
   Fixed on me.    

Old love, old love,   
   How can I be true?   
Shall I be faithless to myself   
   Or to you?

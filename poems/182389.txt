title : Zeus to Juno

He— 

You saw the way her body looked at me   
         all address 
                     calling me down   
she was so 
         well-turned, 
                     curve and volume 
her body presented itself— 
         Clay— 
                     I could mold it 


She— 

You were taboo   
not totem— 
covered her   
though your wing gave no shelter 

Your pale plumage   
became shadow   
Your beak caught   
in the net of her hair 


He— 

When I entered her 
         her death became my life   
in her death swoon 
         she fell away from me   
the more she fell 
         the deeper I pursued her   
the deeper I went 
         the more lost she became   
her body 
         became a forest of echoes   
hills and valleys 
         echoing each other, a language 
I didn't know— 
         surrounded: alone 


She— 

The discarded body   
lies in long grass   
Flies and wasps   
fumble there— 

on a summer day   
the lost girl hums— 
Kelly, Sarah, Joanne changed   
into parable 

Prodigal hair   
flung out   
             body agape   
like a question 

The scavenger crow knows— 
she's beautiful, 
outgrowing her name   
in the noon heat

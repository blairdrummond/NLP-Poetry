is doing her usual for comic relief.   
                        She doesn’t 
               see why she should get on the boat, etc., 

etc., while life as we know it hangs by a thread.   
                        Even God 
               has had one or two great deadpan lines: 

Who told you (this was back at the start— 
                        the teeth 
               of the tautology had just snapped shut) Who 

told you you were naked? The world   
                        was so new 
               that death hadn’t been till this minute 

required. What makes you think (the   
                        ground 
               withers under their feet) we were told? 
 
The woman’s disobedience is good for   
                        plot, 
               as also for restoring plot to human 

scale: three hundred cubits by fifty   
                        by what? 
               What’s that in inches exactly? Whereas 

all obstinate wife is common coin.   
                        In 
               the beginning was nothing and then a flaw 

in the nothing, a sort of mistake that amplified, the   
                        nothing 
               mistranscribed (it takes such discipline 

to keep the prospect clean) and now the lion   
                        whelps, 
               the beetle rolls its ball of dung, and Noah 

with no more than a primitive double- 
                        entry audit   
               is supposed to make it right. 

We find the Creator in an awkward bind.   
                        Washed back 
               to oblivion? Think again. The housewife 

at her laundry tub has got a better grip.    
                        Which may 
               be why we’ve tried to find her laughable, 

she’s such an unhappy reminder of what   
                        understanding 
               costs. Ask the boy who cannot, though 

God know’s he’s tried, he swears   
                        each bar 
               of melting soap will be his last, who cannot 

turn the water off when once he’s turned it on.   
                        His hands 
               are raw. His body seems like filth to him. 

Who told you (the pharmacopoeia has   
                        changed, 
               the malady’s still the same) Who told you 

you were food for worms? 
                        What 
               makes you think (the furrow, the fruit) 

I had to be told?

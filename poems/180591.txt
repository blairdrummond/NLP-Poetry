text : 
I am writing now in preconceptions 

Those of sex and ropes 

Many frantic cruelties occur to the flesh of the 
          
            imagination 

And the imagination does have flesh to destroy 

And the flesh has imagination to sever 

The mouth is just a body filled with imagination 

Can you imagine its contents 

The dripping into a bucket 

And its acts 

The ellipses and chaining apart 

The feather 

The observer 


The imagination, bare, has nothing to confirm it 

There's just the singing of the birds 

The sounds of the natural scream 

A strange example 

The imagination wishes to be embraced by freedom 

It is laid bare in order to be desired 

But the imagination must keep track of the flesh 
          
            responding—its increments of awareness—a 
          
            slow progression 

It must be beautiful and it can't be free 




                     -for John Zorn, after his “Elegy”

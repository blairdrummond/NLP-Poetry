When the trains come into strange cities
The citizens come out to meet the strangers.
                                        I love you, Jack, he said
                                        I love you, Jack, he said
                                        At another station.
When passengers come in from strange cities
The citizens come out to help the strangers.
                                        I love you too, I said
                                        I love you too, I said
                                        From another station.
The citizens are kind to passing strangers
And nourish them and kiss their lips in kindness.
                                        I walk the unbelieving streets
                                        I walk the unbelieving streets
                                        In a strange city.
At night in cold new beds the welcomed strangers
Achieve in memory the city's promise.
                                        I wake in love with you
                                        I wake in love with you
                                        At last year's station.
Then say goodbye to citizens and city
Admit this much--that they were kind to strangers.
                                        I leave my love with you
                                        I leave my love with you
                                        In this strange city.

title : The Lost Pilot

author : James Tate

text : 
for my father, 1922-1944
Your face did not rot 
like the others—the co-pilot,   
for example, I saw him 

yesterday. His face is corn- 
mush: his wife and daughter,   
the poor ignorant people, stare 

as if he will compose soon. 
He was more wronged than Job.   
But your face did not rot 

like the others—it grew dark, 
and hard like ebony; 
the features progressed in their 

distinction. If I could cajole 
you to come back for an evening,   
down from your compulsive 

orbiting, I would touch you,   
read your face as Dallas,   
your hoodlum gunner, now, 

with the blistered eyes, reads   
his braille editions. I would 
touch your face as a disinterested 

scholar touches an original page.   
However frightening, I would   
discover you, and I would not 

turn you in; I would not make   
you face your wife, or Dallas,   
or the co-pilot, Jim. You 

could return to your crazy   
orbiting, and I would not try   
to fully understand what 

it means to you. All I know   
is this: when I see you,   
as I have seen you at least 

once every year of my life,   
spin across the wilds of the sky   
like a tiny, African god, 

I feel dead. I feel as if I were   
the residue of a stranger’s life,   
that I should pursue you. 

My head cocked toward the sky,   
I cannot get off the ground,   
and, you, passing over again, 

fast, perfect, and unwilling   
to tell me that you are doing   
well, or that it was mistake 

that placed you in that world, 
and me in this; or that misfortune   
placed these worlds in us.

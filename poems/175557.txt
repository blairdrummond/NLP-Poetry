author : Benjamin Franklin

text : 
Would you be well receiv’d where’er you go, 
Remember each Man vanquish’d is a Foe: 
Resist not therefore to your utmost Might, 
But let the Weakest think he’s sometimes right; 
He, for each Triumph you shall thus decline, 
Shall give ten Opportunities to shine; 
He sees, since once you own’d him to excel, 
That ’tis his Interest you should reason well.

title : Hide and Seek

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
Of all the things to win at. There I am,
Immobilised except for my young gut, 
Which does its jellyfish and does its clam
Because you've come to double-check the hut:

And the relief is evangelical
That I can breathe again and show my face,
Until all other faces s how that all
Are found and mine was the last hiding-place;

Then many draw to it as a shrine,
In glum approval, jealous but sincere,
That of the silences you favoured mine,
And the last thing that mattered mattered here.

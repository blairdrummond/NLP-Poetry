title : In the Green Morning, Now, Once More

author : Delmore Schwartz

text : 
In the green morning, before
Love was destiny,
The sun was king,
And God was famous.

The merry, the musical, 
The jolly, the magical,
The feast, the feast of feasts, the festival
Suddenly ended
As the sky descended
But there was only the feeling,
In all the dark falling,
Of fragrance and of freshness, of birth and beginning.

title : The French Prisoner

author : János Pilinszky

text : 
If only I could forget him, the Frenchman 
I saw outside our quarters, creeping round   
near daybreak in that density of garden 
as if he'd almost grown into the ground. 
He was just looking back, peering about him 
to check that he was safe here and alone: 
once he was sure, his plunder was all his! 
Whatever chanced, he'd not be moving on. 

He was already eating. He was wolfing 
a pilfered turnip hidden in his rags. 
Eating raw cattle feed. But he'd no sooner 
swallowed a mouthful than it made him gag; 
and the sweet food encountered on his tongue 
delight and then disgust, as it might be 
the unhappy and the happy, meeting in 
their bodies' all-consuming ecstasy. 

Only forget that body. . . Shoulder blades 
trembling, and a hand all skin and bone, 
the palm cramming his mouth in such a way 
that it too seemed to feed in clinging on. 
And then the furious and desperate shame 
of organs galled with one another, forced 
to tear from one another what should bind them 
together in community at last. 

The way his clumsy feet had been left out 
of all that gibbering bestial joy; and how 
they stood splayed out and paralyzed beneath 
the body's torture and fierce rapture now. 
And his look too—if I could forget that! 
Retching, he went on gobbling as if driven 
on and on, just to eat, no matter what, 
anything, this or that, himself even. 
Why go on? It turned out that he'd escaped 
from the prison camp nearby—guards came for him. 
I wander, as I did then in that garden, 
among my garden shadows here at home. 
"If only I could forget him, the Frenchman"— 
I'm looking through my notes, I read one out, 
and from my ears, my eyes, my mouth, the seething 
memory boils over in his shout: 

"I'm hungry!" And immediately I feel 
the undying hunger which this wretched creature 
has long since ceased to feel, for which there is 
no mitigating nourishment in nature. 
He feeds on me. More and more hungrily! 
And I'm less and less sufficient, for my part. 
Now he, who would have been contented once 
with any kind of food, demands my heart.

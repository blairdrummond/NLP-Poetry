title : Damselfly, Trout, Heron

author : John Engels

text : 
The damselfly folds its wings 
over its body when at rest. Captured,   
it should not be killed 
in cyanide, but allowed to die 
slowly: then the colors, 
especially the reds and blues, 
will last. In the hand 
it crushes easily into a rosy 
slime. Its powers of flight 
are weak. The trout 

feeds on the living damselfly. 
The trout leaps up from the water,   
and if there is sun you see 
the briefest shiver of gold, 
and then the river again.          
When the trout dies 
it turns its white belly 
to the mirror of the sky. 
The heron fishes for the trout 

in the gravelly shallows on the far   
side of the stream. The heron   
is the exact blue of the shadows   
the sun makes of trees on water. 
When you hold the heron most clearly   
in your eye, you are least certain   
it is there. When the blue heron dies,   
it lies beyond reach 
on the far side of the river.

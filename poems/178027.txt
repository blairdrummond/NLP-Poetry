title : Blowfly Grass

author : Les Murray

text : 
The houses those suburbs could afford 
were roofed with old savings books, and some   
seeped gravy at stitches in their walls; 

some were clipped as close as fury, 
some grimed and corner-bashed by love   
and the real estate, as it got more vacant, 

grew blady grass and blowfly grass, so called   
for the exquisite lanterns of its seed,   
and the land sagged subtly to a low point, 

it all inclined way out there to a pit   
with burnt-looking cheap marble edges   
and things and figures flew up from it 

like the stones in the crusher Piers had   
for making dusts of them for glazes: 
flint, pyroclase, slickensides, quartz, schist, 

snapping, refusing, and spitting high 
till the steel teeth got gritty corners on them   
and could grip them craw-chokingly to grind. 

It’s their chance, a man with beerglass-cut arms   
told me. Those hoppers got to keep filled. A girl,   
edging in, bounced out cropped and wrong-coloured 

like a chemist’s photo, crying. Who could blame her   
among in-depth grabs and Bali flights and phones?   
She was true, and got what truth gets.

Petit, the Poet 
Edgar Lee Masters 
1868-1950
Modern
U.S., Midwestern




Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, like mites in a quarrel-- 
Faint iambics that the full breeze wakens-- 
But the pine tree makes a symphony thereof. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Ballades by the score with the same old thought: 
The snows and the roses of yesterday are vanished; 
And what is love but a rose that fades? 
Life all around me here in the village: 
Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth, 
Courage, constancy, heroism, failure-- 
All in the loom, and oh what patterns! 
Woodlands, meadows, streams and rivers-- 
Blind to all of it all my life long. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics, 
While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines?

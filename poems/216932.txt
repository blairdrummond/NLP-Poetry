title : Apostrophe to the Apostrophe

author : Eric Nelson

text : 
Small floater, you stay above the fray, 
a wink at nothing's nod, a raised brow 
watching p's and q's, a selfless mote 
between I and m, a little horn of plenty 
spilling plurals, disdaining the bottom line. 

Unlike your twin relatives—groupies of wit 
and wisdom, hangers on in the smallest talk—
you work alone, dark of a crescent moon. 
Laboring in obscurity, you never ask why, 
never exclaim, never tell anyone where to go. 

Caught up between extremes, you are both 
a turning away and a stepping forth, 
a loss and an addition. You are the urge 
to possess everything, and the sure sign 
that something is missing.

title : trouble with spain

author : Charles Bukowski

text : 
I got in the shower 
and burned my balls 
last Wednesday. 

met this painter called Spain, 
no, he was a cartoonist, 
well, I met him at a party 
and everybody got mad at me 
because I didn’t know who he was 
or what he did. 

he was rather a handsome guy 
and I guess he was jealous because 
I was so ugly. 
they told me his name 
and he was leaning against the wall 
looking handsome, and I said: 
hey, Spain, I like that name: Spain. 
but I don’t like you. why don’t we step out 
in the garden and I’ll kick the shit out of your 
ass? 

this made the hostess angry 
and she walked over and rubbed his pecker 
while I went to the crapper 
and heaved. 

but everybody's angry at me. 
Bukowski, he can’t write, he’s had it. 
washed-up. look at him drink. 
he never used to come to parties. 
now he comes to parties and drinks everything 
up and insults real talent. 
I used to admire him when he cut his wrists 
and when he tried to kill himself with 
gas. look at him now leering at that 19 year old 
girl, and you know he 
can’t get it up. 

I not only burnt my balls in that shower 
last Wednesday, I spun around to get out of the burning 
water and burnt my bunghole 
too.

text : 
I approached the luminous stranger who came to me 
from darkness in a gown of lettuce leaves, in a velvet 

cloak of green that appeared at first another piece of dark, 
but pulled apart into the glow-sphere that danced 

in swaying steps, the lucent majesty that slipped toward me 
from the reigning silence black above my cage. 

Oh extravagant—and were my teeth too sharp to greet 
or sharp enough? I do not understand now what was meant 

to happen and what was a mistake—but know the bursting, 
the sickening snap of ecstasy wrenched back to the body 

and the green gown flung in crippled circles traced 
like diagrams of wasting moons above my head—or portals 

to another world, I thought, but as I thought, the shriek 
dissolved, the body crumpled from the air and landed 

on its side beneath the salt lick. All night I tended 
the wasted skin and careful, brought it water, 

alfalfa, made a bed of cedar chips and tried to gather 
molecules of breath that floated from the plant shelf. 

When I remembered morning, I began to cry, began to pray 
for night to stay until the green took shape again 

and if that shape were gone, I prayed for night 
to stay, to be held in the same forever-dark


in which I first looked up and saw the gentle body,
 and saw the graceful swaying of the stranger coming
 
as if for me—now I do not know—but then,
 as if for me, and all my loneliness gone.

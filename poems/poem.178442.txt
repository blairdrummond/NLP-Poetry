For some people the day comes 
when they have to declare the great Yes 
or the great No. It's clear at once who has the Yes 
ready within him; and saying it, 

he goes from honor to honor, strong in his conviction. 
He who refuses does not repent. Asked again, 
he'd still say no. Yet that no--the right no-- 
drags him down all his life.

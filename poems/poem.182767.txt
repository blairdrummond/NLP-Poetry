Sonnet

That I might chisel a statue, line on line, 
   Out of a marble's chaste severities! 
   Angular, harsh; no softened curves to please; 
Set tears within the eyes to make them shine, 
And furrows on the brow, deep, stern, yet fine; 
   Gaunt, awkward, tall; no courtier of ease; 
   The trousers bulging at the bony knees; 
Long nose, large mouth . . . But ah, the light divine 
Of Truth, - the light that set a people free!-- 
   Burning upon it in a steady flame, 
   As sunset fires a white peak on the sky . . .
Ah, God! To leave it nameless and yet see 
   Men looking weep and bow themselves and cry-- 
   'Enough, enough! We know thy statue's name!'

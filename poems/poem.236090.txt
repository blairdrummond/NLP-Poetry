Four-Leaf Clover

I know a place where the sun is like gold, 
   And the cherry blooms burst with snow, 
And down underneath is the loveliest nook, 
   Where the four-leaf clovers grow. 

One leaf is for hope, and one is for faith, 
   And one is for love, you know, 
And God put another in for luck-- 
   If you search, you will find where they grow. 

But you must have hope, and you must have faith, 
   You must love and be strong - and so--
If you work, if you wait, you will find the place 
      Where the four-leaf clovers grow.

Two wandering across the porcelain 
Siberia, one alone on the window sill, 

four across the ceiling's senseless field 
of pale yellow, one negotiating folds 

in a towel: tiny, bronze-colored, antennae 
'strongly elbowed,' crawling over Antony  

and Cleopatra, face down, unsurprised, 
one dead in the mountainous bar of soap. 

Sub-family Formicinae (a single 
segment behind the thorax), the sickle 

moons of their abdomens, one trapped in bubbles 
(I soak in the tub); with no clear purpose 

they come in by the baseboard, do not bite, 
crush bloodless beneath a finger. Peterson's 

calls them 'social creatures,' yet what grim 
society: identical pilgrims, 

seed-like, brittle, pausing on the path 
only three seconds to touch another's 

face, some hoisting the papery carcasses 
of their dead in their jaws, which open and close 

like the clasp of a necklace. 'Mating occurs 
in flight'â€” what better way? Weightless, reckless 

rapture: the winged queen and her mate, quantum 
passion spiraling near the kumquat, 

and then the queen sheds her wings, plants 
the pearl-like larvae in their cribs of sand: 

more anvil-headed, creeping attentions 
to follow cracks in the tile, the lip of the tub, 

and one starting across the mirror now, doubled.

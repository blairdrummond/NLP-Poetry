title : Giving a Manicure

author : Minnie Bruce Pratt

text : 
The woman across from me looks so familiar, 
but when I turn, her look glances off. At the last 
subway stop we rise. I know her, she gives manicures 
at Vogue Nails. She has held my hands between hers 
several times. She bows and smiles. There the women 
wear white smocks like technicians, and plastic tags 
with their Christian names. Susan. No, not Susan, 
whose hair is cropped short, who is short and stocky. 
This older lady does my hands while classical music, 
often Mozart, plays. People passing by outside are 
doubled in the wall mirror. Two of everyone walk 
forward, backward, vanish at the edge of the shop. 
Susan does pedicures, pumice on my heels as I sit 
on the stainless-steel throne. She bends over, she 
kneads my feet in the water like laundry. She pounds 
my calves with her fists and her cupped palms slap 
a working beat, p’ansori style. She talks to the others 
without turning her head, a call in a language shouted 
hoarse across fields where a swallow flew and flew 
across the ocean, and then fetched back to Korea 
a magic gourd seed, back to the farmer’s empty house 
where the seed flew from its beak to sprout a green vine. 
When the farmer’s wife cut open the ripe fruit, out spilled 
seeds of gold. Choi Don Mee writes that some girls 
in that country crush petals on their nails, at each tip 
red flowers unfold. Yi Yon-ju writes that some women 
there, as here, dream of blades, knives, a bowl of blood.

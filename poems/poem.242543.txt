Refrain, Rhymed Stanza

Two women on the lone wet strand
   (The wind's out with a will to roam)
The waves wage war on rocks and sand, 
   (And a ship is long due home.)

The sea sprays in the women's eyes--
   (Hearts can writhe like the sea's wild foam)
Lower descend the tempestuous skies,
   (For the wind's out with a will to roam.)

"O daughter, thine eyes be better than mine,"
   (The waves ascend high as yonder dome)
"North or south is there never a sign?"
   (And a ship is long due home.)

They watched there all the long night through--
   (The wind's out with a will to roam)
Wind and rain and sorrow for two--
   (And heaven on the long reach home.)

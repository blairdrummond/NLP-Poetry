Heifetz’s Decca recordings show him doing what he did best: transforming two- and three-minute trifles into works of perfection.—John Maltese
Imperfect things are always— 
it seems—a wave 
of some wand away 
from perfection. 
They’re there—the toady 
and the bumpy 
with warts—for turning   
into princes. Even pumpkins— 
propped upon 
piles of lumber— 
idle like unupholstered 
carriages up on cinder 
blocks. But a trifle’s potential— 
its capacity for alchemy, actually— 
can leave you longing 
for lead. So many things 
you think are Prince Hals 
are really just kings.

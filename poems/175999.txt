title : Uneasy Rider

Falling in love with a mustache 
is like saying 
you can fall in love with 
the way a man polishes his shoes 
                which, 
                of course, 
                is one of the things that turns on   
                my tuned-up engine 

                those trim buckled boots 

                (I feel like an advertisement   
                for men’s fashions 
                when I think of your ankles) 

Yeats was hung up with a girl’s beautiful face   

and I find myself 

a bad moralist, 

a failing aesthetician, 

a sad poet, 

wanting to touch your arms and feel the muscles   
that make a man’s body have so much substance,   
that makes a woman 
lean and yearn in that direction 
that makes her melt/ she is a rainy day   
in your presence 
the pool of wax under a burning candle   
the foam from a waterfall 

You are more beautiful than any Harley-Davidson   
She is the rain, 
waits in it for you, 
finds blood spotting her legs 
from the long ride.

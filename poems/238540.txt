title : The Letter From Home

The dogs barked, the dogs scratched, the dogs got wet, the 
dogs shook, the dogs circled, the dogs slept, the dogs ate, 
the dogs barked; the rain fell down, the leaves fell down, the 
eggs fell down and cracked on the floor; the dust settled,  
the wood floors were scratched, the cabinets sat without 
doors, the trim without paint, the stuff piled up; I loaded the 
dishwasher, I unloaded the dishwasher, I raked the leaves, 
I did the laundry, I took out the garbage, I took out the 
recycling, I took out the yard waste.  There was a bed, it was 
soft, there was a blanket, it was warm, there were dreams, 
they were good. The corn grew, the eggplant grew, the 
tomatoes grew, the lettuce grew, the strawberries grew, the 
blackberries grew; the tea kettle screamed, the computer 
keys clicked, the radio roared, the TV spoke. “Will they ever 
come home?” “Can’t I take a break?” “How do others keep 
their house clean?” “Will I remember this day in fifty years?” 
The sweet tea slipped down my throat, the brownies melted 
in my mouth. My mother cooked, the apple tree bloomed, the 
lilac bloomed, the mimosa bloomed, I bloomed.

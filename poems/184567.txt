title : Lines——

author : Hartley Coleridge

text : 
I have been cherish’d and forgiven 
    By many tender-hearted, 
’Twas for the sake of one in Heaven 
    Of him that is departed. 

Because I bear my Father’s name 
    I am not quite despised, 
My little legacy of fame 
    I’ve not yet realized. 

And yet if you should praise myself 
    I’ll tell you, I had rather 
You’d give your love to me, poor elf, 
    Your praise to my great father.

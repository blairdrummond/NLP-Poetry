title : Between Here & There

I.
  
 Let me speak with expressive
  
 hesitation & a feeling for
  
 interment why even
  
 lineate what isn’t broken by
  
 music let me speak with
  
 inextricable reluctance.
  
 I want to tear the heart
  
 from refused convalescence
  
 & feed it those long fronds
  
 of river bed grass. I want to
  
 tear the heart out of style
  
 & put it between
  
 utter thrall & the infancy
  
 of all things impure.
  
 Torn out, a flame thickens
  
 between us as if
  
 not right now we’ll be
  
 ripped from this life
  
 or each other a white
  
 lie not a little more tender
  
 than quick. Inextricable
  
 reluctance to die or even
  
 leave youth culture ever.
  
 What a stupid feeling.
  
 Do you think it isn’t
  
 true? The very existence
  
 of flame throwers proves
  
 that sometime, somewhere,
  
 someone said to themselves
  
 ‘You know I want to
  
 set those people over there
  
 on fire but I’m just not
  
 close enough to get the
  
 job done.’ Someone
  
 puts their arms around you
  
 in the cold. There’s an al-
  
 most disquieting closeness
  
 as gossamer clots &
  
 becomes an impasto derivative
  
 of some newly visible
  
 interdependence. Flame
  
 throwers then are just
  
 a description of prevailing
  
 ideology, relics, the life
  
 of the party, a soul
  
 flirts by burning
  
 that name for itself
  
 up in jonesing that comes
  
 at the end of desire?
  
 Well I wouldn’t know
  
 about that. A little
  
 goat. Why would it
  
 nuzzle dreamily up
  
 the way I nuzzle dreamily
  
 up to my knees. In the
  
 ‘fatal position’ as my
  
 nephew used to call it
  
 estranged from play
  
 waiting on the fox hunt.
  
 Oh baby
  
 it beats up my lips
  
 the somatic effects
  
 of contriving a psychic
  
 blockade against death
  
 with the contours of your
  
 face & healing
  
 in constant eclipse
  
 where all things
  
 inextricably broken by
  
 music make the basic
  
 rhythmic unit go
  
 something like this — I 
  
 don’t want to loose you. I
  
 don’t want to be
  
 empty, clever hold &
  
 keep you. I was lost
  
 to you to start with still
  
 I keep on coming back.
  
 Do you think you’ll 
  
 keep on coming back to me
  
 forever? That’s the meaning
  
 of our life together
  
 baby.

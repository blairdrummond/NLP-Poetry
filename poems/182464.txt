title : Finding a Bible in an Abandoned Cabin

author : Robert Wrigley

text : 
Under dust plush as a moth’s wing,   
the book’s leather cover still darkly shown,   
and everywhere else but this spot was sodden   
beneath the roof’s unraveling shingles.   
There was that back-of-the-neck lick of chill   
and then, from my index finger, the book   

opened like a blasted bird.   In its box   
of familiar and miraculous inks,   
a construction of filaments and dust,   
thoroughfares of worms, and a silage   
of silverfish husks:   in the autumn light,   
eight hundred pages of perfect wordless lace.

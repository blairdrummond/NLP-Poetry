Couplet, Epigram

My little book: who will thou please, tell me?
 All which shall read thee? No that cannot be.
 Whom then, the best? But few of these are known.
 How shall thou know to please, thou know'st not whom?
 The meaner sort commend not poetry;
 And sure the worst should please themselves for thee:
       But let them pass, and set by most no store,
       Please thou one well, thou shall not need please more.

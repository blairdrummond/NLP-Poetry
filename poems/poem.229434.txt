Grown about by fragrant bushes,
Sunken in a winding valley,
      Where the clear winds blow
      And the shadows come and go,
      And the cattle stand and low
And the sheep bells and the linnets
      Sing and tinkle musically.
Between the past and the future,
      Those two black infinities
      Between which our brief life
      Flashes a moment and goes out.

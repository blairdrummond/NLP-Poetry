Shed a tear for Twickham Tweer 
who ate uncommon meals, 
who often peeled bananas 
and then only ate the peels, 
who emptied jars of marmalade 
and only ate the jars, 
and only ate the wrappers 
off of chocolate candy bars. 

When Twickham cooked a chicken 
he would only eat the bones, 
he discarded scoops of ice cream 
though he always ate the cones, 
he’d boil a small potato 
but he’d only eat the skin, 
and pass up canned asparagus 
to gobble down the tin. 

He sometimes dined on apple cores 
and bags of peanut shells, 
on cottage cheese containers, 
cellophane from caramels, 
but Twickham Tweer passed on last year, 
that odd and novel man, 
when he fried an egg one morning 
and then ate the frying pan.

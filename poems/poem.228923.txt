Thou hidden love of God, whose height, 
      Whose depth unfathom'd no man knows, 
I see from far thy beauteous light, 
      Inly I sigh for thy repose; 
My heart is pain'd, nor can it be 
At rest, till it finds rest in thee. 

Thy secret voice invites me still, 
      The sweetness of thy yoke to prove: 
And fain I would: but tho' my will 
      Seem fix'd, yet wide my passions rove; 
Yet hindrances strew all the way; 
I aim at thee, yet from thee stray. 

'Tis mercy all, that thou hast brought 
      My mind to seek her peace in thee; 
Yet while I seek, but find thee not, 
      No peace my wand'ring soul shall see; 
O when shall all my wand'rings end, 
And all my steps to thee-ward tend! 

Is there a thing beneath the sun 
      That strives with thee my heart to share? 
Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone, 
      The Lord of ev'ry motion there; 
Then shall my heart from earth be free, 
When it hath found repose in thee. 

O hide this self from me, that I 
      No more, but Christ in me may live; 
My vile affections crucify, 
      Nor let one darling lust survive; 
In all things nothing may I see, 
Nothing desire or seek but thee. 

O Love, thy sov'reign aid impart, 
      To save me from low-thoughted care: 
Chase this self-will thro' all my heart, 
      Thro' all its latent mazes there: 
Make me thy duteous child, that I 
Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry! 

Ah no! ne'er will I backward turn: 
      Thine wholly, thine alone I am! 
Thrice happy he who views with scorn 
      Earth's toys, for thee his constant flame; 
O help that I may never move 
From the blest footsteps of thy love! 

Each moment draw from earth away 
      My heart that lowly waits thy call: 
Speak to my inmost soul, and say, 
      I am thy love, thy God, thy all! 
To feel thy power, to hear thy voice, 
To taste thy love, be all my choice.

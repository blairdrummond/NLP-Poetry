Heart, oh heart,
 I sit here writing your name
 on pieces of paper,
 folded, hidden, misplaced . . .
 found again.
  
 There is the element of saying
 and there is the element of making:
 one needn’t choose.
 I am singing the dream out from the ice,
 asking it to carry me
 like a horse or a river, down and away.
  
 This day, here in paned-glass sun:
 the young waitress shaking out her apron
 and retying it flat across her stomach—
 a bit of vanity—her hair swept off her neck,
 crash of a milk bottle
 on the granite counter, cream
 spread in a mild pool toward the rim,
 and the roots of habit and longing
 briefly seized by the mind.
  
 So noisy here! The sound echoes
 out of years, brought to this 
 showing forth, unrehearsed.
 It seems we wake 
 and find ourselves repeating,
 embodying the ancient gestures
 by which we recognize
 ourselves completed.
  
 Not one of us could be born
 and invent life—it must show through us—
 the arm flung in the air, the coffee poured out,
 and down the street, someone hurrying by,
 head down against the wind.
  
 And a man and a woman
 come to an old grief,
 carved in them, carved
 into them
 —the old way of water wearing rock—
 by law, and the hatred
 between them is equal
 to the hope neither will release.
  
 Each wants to be whole,
 to embody all of time, when nothing
 in this world is whole, and
 this is by law.
  
 When my father said bitterly
 to my mother: you have changed,
 he meant, without meaning to say,
 how she had changed him. A man
 holds his head down against the wind.
 Yet the wind fills him
 with the dust of temples,
 the breath of the dead.
  
 The dream of the light
 inside the branches—
 a gleam of wet, glimmer that is a bud,
 the leaf within the bud.
  
 The photographer comes inside
 and closes the lens of his camera.
 Then he is the lens. Then my eye
 is the light. This
 is the element of saying.
 The young waitress flings a paper cup
 behind her, into the trash can.
 That is a saying. The cream swirled
 into the coffee, the sugar
 dissolving, disembodied,
 and the body of the manager disappears,
 swallowed into a doorway.
  
 The element of making is slow,
 uncertain as a temple,
 a falling forward, stitching back,
 like a stone wall, like the panes in an
 arched window, like a repetition
 chosen beyond necessity.
  
 Yet somehow we have seen all this before—
 the girl in the fur hat
 speaking syrup into a phone;
 the falseness of her charm
 is an ancient imposter, familiar and
 therefore true.
 A door is opened and falls
 closed. Suddenly at every table
 someone looks down and is reading—
 books, newspapers, calendars,
 reading tea leaves, reading bones.
  
 A woman in a periwinkle jacket: I am reading
 her shoulders as the day introspects.
 In dream the passive construction
 and the past perfect tense prevail:
 she was being pushed on a swing.
 The woman with many television credits
 gazes out the window, heavy with years,
 forgetting herself, forgetting sorrow,
 the false husband, the crippled child,
 the old plots forgetting,
  
 and it is suddenly lovely, as free as
 something read or dreamed; the young
 waitress with sun on her
 face—her unblemished face—looks up,
 from the middle of eternity, her desire
 immaculate in the moment.
  
 When a word is beautiful
 above all others—your name—
 when a woman appears as a bird of prey
 and we turn away,
 hoping not to be recognized—oh heart!—
  
 when the light on the branches
 flares in a window with no sky,
 this is old story reading us, these are springs
 from words laid down before
 and ahead of us, and in the moment
 we are making an answer.

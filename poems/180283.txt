title : [As if the moon could haul through you]

author : Neil Fischer

text : 
As if the moon could haul through you 
Its tremor of light and stone, 
Be cleared of sound. Plough 
The mind's noise until it's a shine 

In the purl of south-bending river that bears 
Itself toward a blacker part of the forest. 
If you hum, hum through the motes of air, 
Perhaps your nerves will find at last 

A tone to which they will succumb. 
Be still. Be not so heavy-hearted 
For a moment. All is not a tomb, 
Blind sarcophagus staring dumb, thwarted 

Pleasures nailed inside. These fireflies 
Sweep their tracings on the evening. 
Weep if you must, but board what falls 
Away, abdomens flaringâ€” 

The brief, nomadic intervals.

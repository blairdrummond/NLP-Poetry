title : To the Western World

text : 
A siren sang, and Europe turned away 
From the high castle and the shepherd’s crook.   
Three caravels went sailing to Cathay 
On the strange ocean, and the captains shook   
Their banners out across the Mexique Bay. 

And in our early days we did the same.   
Remembering our fathers in their wreck 
We crossed the sea from Palos where they came   
And saw, enormous to the little deck,   
A shore in silence waiting for a name. 

The treasures of Cathay were never found.   
In this America, this wilderness 
Where the axe echoes with a lonely sound,   
The generations labor to possess 
And grave by grave we civilize the ground.

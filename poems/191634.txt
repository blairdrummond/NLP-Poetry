title : from Pecksniffiana: Fabliau of Florida

author : Wallace Stevens

text : 
Barque of phosphor
 On the palmy beach,
  
 Move outward into heaven,
 Into the alabasters
 And night blues.
  
 Foam and cloud are one.
 Sultry moon-monster
 Are dissolving.
  
 Fill your black hull
 With white moonlight.
  
 There will never be an end
 To this droning of the surf.

text : 
this is just to say I saw the icebox and wheels 
rumbling through the figure 5 
I saw the white chickens 
in the dark city glazed with rain 
I saw the figure 5 in the white chickens 
the plums that were in gold on a red wheel barrow 
the plums that you were probably 
saving among the rain water 
I have eaten the dark city so sweet 
the plums that were so sweet 
this is just to say I have eaten the figure 5 
in the plums that so much depends 
that were in gold on a red firetruck

title : Tricyclist and a Turtle

author : Molly McQuade

text : 
Minnesota 
snapping turtles 
clutched by little cities 

are wet busts of moonstone 
wreathed in scum, 
the gray self sugared, 

half a lot 
of granite 
phlegm stopped 

upon a chaise longue, 
that incoming 
pod of him 

dunked, 
thorny hooves aswim. 
Lichen licked him, 

then he quivered 
in the stem, 
and didactic stoicism stitched 

him tight with 
a neat twine. 
Even when 

tapped on the back 
by a barefoot tricyclist 
with a bulging wheaten midriff, 

he does not respond 
except that 
a flagellant

paddling worm 
nested in 
the necropolis 

of his nape twists 
in disgust 
under the skin, 

keeping all the grim social hate 
safe 
in him.

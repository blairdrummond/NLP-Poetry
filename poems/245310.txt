And so it began: the earth torn, split open
 by a dirt road cutting through palmettos
 and wild tamarind trees defending the land
 against the sun. Beside the road, a shack
 leaning into the wind, on the wooden porch,
 crates of avocados and limes, white chickens
 pecking at the floor boards, and a man
 under the shadow of his straw hat, staring
 into the camera in 1914. He doesn't know
 within a lifetime the unclaimed land behind
 him will be cleared of scrub and sawgrass,
 the soil will be turned, made to give back
 what the farmers wish, their lonely houses
 will stand acres apart from one another,
 jailed behind the boughs of their orchards.
 He'll never buy sugar at the general store,
 mail love letters at the post office, or take
 a train at the depot of the town that will rise
 out of hundred-million years of coral rock
 on promises of paradise. He'll never ride
 a Model-T puttering down the dirt road
 that will be paved over, stretch farther and
 farther west into the horizon, reaching for
 the setting sun after which it will be named.
 He can't even begin to imagine the shadows
 of buildings rising taller than the palm trees,
 the street lights glowing like counterfeit stars
 dotting the sky above the road, the thousands
 who will take the road everyday, who'll also
 call this place home less than a hundred years
 after the photograph of him hanging today
 in City Hall as testament. He'll never meet
 me, the engineer hired to transform the road
 again, bring back tree shadows and birdsongs,
 build another promise of another paradise
 meant to last another forever. He'll never see
 me, the poet standing before him, trying
 to read his mind across time, wondering if
 he was thinking what I'm today, both of us
 looking down the road that will stretch on
 for years after I too disappear into a photo.

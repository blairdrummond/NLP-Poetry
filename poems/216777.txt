In a rush this weekday morning,
I tap the horn as I speed past the cemetery 
where my parents are buried
side by side beneath a slab of smooth   granite. 

Then, all day, I think of him rising up 
to give me that look 
of knowing disapproval 
while my mother calmly tells him to lie back down.

Sonnet, Simile

Eat thou and drink; to-morrow thou shalt die.
         Surely the earth, that's wise being very old,
         Needs not our help. Then loose me, love, and hold
Thy sultry hair up from my face; that I
May pour for thee this golden wine, brim-high,
         Till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold.
         We'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours are toll'd,
Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.

Now kiss, and think that there are really those,
         My own high-bosom'd beauty, who increase
                Vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way!
                Through many years they toil; then on a day
         They die not,?for their life was death,?but cease;
And round their narrow lips the mould falls close.

title : Moon Festival

author : Bei Dao

text : 
Lovers holding pits in their mouths 
make vows and delight in each other 
till the underwater infant 
periscopes his parents 
and is born 

an uninvited guest knocks at my 
door, determined to go deep 
into the interior of things 

the trees applaud 

wait a minute, the full moon 
and this plan are making me nervous 
my hand fluttering 
over the obscure implications of the letter 
let me sit in the dark 
a while longer, like 
sitting on a friend's heart 

the city a burning deck 
on the frozen sea 
can it be saved? it must be saved 
the faucet drip-drop drip-drop 
mourns the reservoir

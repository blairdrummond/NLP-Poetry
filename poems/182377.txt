title : A Panic That Can Still Come Upon Me

author : Peter Gizzi

text : 
If today and today I am calling aloud 

If I break into pieces of glitter on asphalt 
bits of sun, the din 

if tires whine on wet pavement 
everything humming 

If we find we are still in motion 
and have arrived in Zeno’s thought, like 

if sunshine hits marble and the sea lights up 
we might know we were loved, are loved 
if flames and harvest, the enchanted plain 

If our wishes are met with dirt 
and thyme, thistle, oil, 
heirloom, and basil 

or the end result is worry, chaos 
and if “I should know better” 

If our loves are anointed with missiles 
Apache fire, Tomahawks 
did we follow the tablets the pilgrims suggested 

If we ask that every song touch its origin 
just once and the years engulfed 

If problems of identity confound sages, 
derelict philosophers, administrators 
who can say I am found 

if this time you, all of it, this time now 

If nothing save Saturdays at the metro and 
if rain falls sidelong in the platz 
doorways, onto mansard roofs 

If enumerations of the fall 
and if falling, cities rocked 
with gas fires at dawn 

Can you rescind the ghost’s double nakedness 
hungry and waning 

if children, soldiers, children   
taken down in schools 

if burning fuel 

Who can’t say they have seen this 
and can we sing this 

if in the auroras’ reflecting the sea, 
gauze touching the breast 

Too bad for you, beautiful singer 
unadorned by laurel 
child of thunder and scapegoat alike 

If the crowd in the mind becoming 
crowded in street and villages, and trains 
run next to the freeway 

If exit is merely a sign

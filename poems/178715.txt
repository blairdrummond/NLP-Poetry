title : Under Stars

author : Tess Gallagher

text : 
The sleep of this night deepens 
because I have walked coatless from the house 
carrying the white envelope. 
All night it will say one name 
in its little tin house by the roadside. 

I have raised the metal flag 
so its shadow under the roadlamp 
leaves an imprint on the rain-heavy bushes. 
Now I will walk back 
thinking of the few lights still on 
in the town a mile away. 

In the yellowed light of a kitchen 
the millworker has finished his coffee, 
his wife has laid out the white slices of bread 
on the counter. Now while the bed they have left 
is still warm, I will think of you, you 
who are so far away 
you have caused me to look up at the stars. 

Tonight they have not moved 
from childhood, those games played after dark. 
Again I walk into the wet grass 
toward the starry voices. Again, I 
am the found one, intimate, returned 
by all I touch on the way.

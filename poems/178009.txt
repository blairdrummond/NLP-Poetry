title : Mythmaking on the Merritt Parkway

author : G. E. Murray

text : 
Aluminum sky. Only November   
Leaks into early frost 
Like a ruptured jug 
Of gas. I’d rather hold 
Onto this road with pliers   
Than have another face of you   
Frisk my heart. Cool hands,   
The touch of every moon 
Is crucial and incomplete 
As a sponge bath. Leaving   
A backbone of lights 
Behind me, a blinking string   
Of pelts in fox country, 
I long to slice through 
Connecticut’s middle, marbled   
And pink as medium-rare beef.   
I dream you.

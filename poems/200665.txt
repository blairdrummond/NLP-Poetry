title : The Hook

The students, lost in raucousness,   
caught as by the elder Breughel’s eye,   
we sit in the college store 
over sandwiches and coffee, wondering.   
She answers eagerly: the place was fine;   
sometimes the winds grew very cold,   
the snows so deep and wide she lost   
sight of people. Yes, she was well   
satisfied with her work, expected— 
while the quarry’s owner was away— 
to do another year of it. 


             II 

She is hammering. I hear 
the steady sound inside our dry,   
noisy days. Sparks fly; the mind,   
so taken, mighty for a moment,   
becomes quarry and sculptor both,   
something caught like love and war   
in this golden mesh: and daring   
caught that flings like sparks girls   
and boys, flagrant cities prompt   
to daring’s will, love and war   
its burly seconds. 


             III 

I see again three kids we passed,   
three kids lounging at the edge 
of a forsaken quarry like something   
they had built; in its sleepy pool 
they found the whiteness of their bodies, 
the excitement like parian marble. 


             IV 

Such the waters we find ourselves 
in. We sit in the college store absorbed   
in food and talk. Eagerness seizes us   
like love that leaves its best sailors   
in the mighty waves, love the word 
for hook whose catching, and the struggle   
there, is one great musical clash 
of minds—each wave a passion and a mind— 
a possessed, tumultuous monument   
that would be free.

                                           We strain forward 
as to some fabulous story. Incandescence   
springs from her, the hammer of remembrance   
fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful body,   
face shining, who sculptured all winter 
alone near the source of her rock, 
digging down into the difficult rock: 

the young woman who lost a day once,   
talked to her cat, and when the mirror 
of her art became too clear, when dreaming   
seemed too big for night alone, took long 
walks back to people, back to speech, 
and time: 
             the woman, who at last— 
“I do not use live models”—sculptured fish— 
“I remember long lonely holidays at shores   
when the spray alone defined green shapes   
approaching”—has just seen (her eyes 
still gleam with the gleam of it, 
blink like the making of many 
a take) a great catch. 


             VI 

                                                   April, we say, 
is the time for fish, for reaching   
in its sea-like waftings one 
of earth’s original conclusions 
like the leftover gill slits 
the singing student told us about 
in this very spot just two days ago . . . 

we are in the middle of a great catch,   
there collected as from her year-long   
lonely rock, the thrashing, clean- 
scaled, clear-lit shad in the net.

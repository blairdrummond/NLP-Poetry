title : Silent Film

author : Kurt Brown

text : 
Doors opened and shut,   
the director shouted orders   
through a bullhorn,   
or babbled just   
                              out of the frame.   
A carpenter hammered flats nearby   
for the next production.   
All of this, and more,   
while the actors blocked it out,   
already living   
in that small square of light   
where silence reigned   
like a tiny theatre for the deaf.   

Now, almost a century later,   
it's peaceful, far   
from the center of action,   
the last voice on the street   
reduced to a whisper,   
                              then gone.   
Not even birdsong   
as evening's opening credits   
begin to roll.   

Only the film,   
shimmering out of a disc   
thinner than sound,   
characters moving   
like fish in their gray element—   
less than fish—   
not a hiss, not a bubble,   
not even a cry   
from that dim world of silence   
doubled by time.

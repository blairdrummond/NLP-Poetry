title : Gout

author : Lewis Warsh

text : 
He changes into a bird, and that’s
 the only difference. Rain
 on the improved sidewalk seems
 inspired after so much heat.
 Look at the objects
 that have already wilted and died.
 Someone is losing hair trying
 to penetrate the meaning of death—rather
 language which postpones dying
 is inventing a drug to keep us alive.
 Being similar never made this body more true. Bills
 for electricity and answering
 service are burning inside the hearth.
 My dream, to have a hearth and
 set an example for fading
 youth. The conspicuous peacock
 neither turns nor changes,
 yet suddently loses its feathers, buckles
 in the dust and dies. The
 meaning is as fantastic as any truth. Language
 invents a painkilling drug for restoring youth—an
 occasion inviting feelings which
 jolt and never subside. I mean
 he is dying again, slowly, as he gains time.

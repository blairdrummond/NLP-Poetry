title : The Town Fathers

author : Melvin B. Tolson

At the Courthouse Square
 On the Fourth of July,
 Beneath Old Glory’s
 Pyrotechnic sky,
 The town fathers met,
 Minus Bible and rye.
  
 Against the statue
 Of Confederate dead
 The Mayor spat
 His snuff and said,
 “We need a slogan!”
 And he palmed his head.
  
 The Sheriff’s idioms
 Dynamited assent.
 The Judge croaked a phrase
 Latinistically bent.
 And the Mayor pondered
 With official intent.
  
 On a neon billboard,
 As high as a steeple,
 The travelers puzzle
 The amazing sequel:
 The Blackest Land
 And The Whitest People.

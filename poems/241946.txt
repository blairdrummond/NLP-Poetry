text : 
After the declaration by emperor
 to stop the war
 many people in Tokyo killed themselves,
 for instance, in front of the imperial palace.
 But few people knows those facts.
  
 Hence you must teach me
 where you got the news or what sort of book
 gave you the fact that quite few people knows.
 To know the fact of our nation’s subjection
 is not so comfortable
 but the fact of many people’s spontaneous death
 gives me more complicated feelings.
  
 In the matter of what William Gass said
 I must describe my feelings. I went
 to Nagasaki
 on an educational trip four years ago.
 I can recollect those serious moment
 which was given by the beamed materials
 in the memorial hall.
  
 But most youth after the war
 are indifferent to those
 nightmares
 because of our no experience. Surely,
 I think, those barbarious conducts
 shouldn’t be forgiven or forgotten at all
 and we must not close our eyes
 to the rebombing
 at any place
 in this world.
  
 In conclusion I may say that most people
 except sufferers
 or the like
 will not have ill feelings toward your country
 but they will reproach
 the suffocative fact
 in history.
  
 Where were you when the World War II was over.
 Please share your experience of the war with me.
 I’m now interested in the wars concerned with Japan
 for the past 100 years. If you tell me your reflections
 I can suspect more seriously.
 You have abandoned such cursed things as useless?
 In that war 3 million people were killed
 on the side of our nation, especially
 three hundred thousand people by the A-bomb.
 Over the war between the imperialism
 and militarism America won a victory.
 What does this word mean?﻿

title : The Perfect Life

author : John Koethe

text : 
I have a perfect life. It isn't much,   
 But it's enough for me. It keeps me alive   
 And happy in a vague way: no disappointments   
 On the near horizon, no pangs of doubt;   
 Looking forward in anticipation, looking back   
 In satisfaction at the conclusion of each day.   
 I heed the promptings of my inner voice,   
 And what I hear is comforting, full of reassurance   
 For my own powers and innate superiority—the fake   
 Security of someone in the grip of a delusion,   
 In denial, climbing ever taller towers   
 Like a tiny tyrant looking on his little kingdom   
 With a secret smile, while all the while 

 Time lies in wait. And what feels ample now   
 Turns colorless and cold, and what seems beautiful 
 And strong becomes an object of indifference   
 Reaching out to no one, as later middle age   
 Turns old, and the strength is gone.   
 Right now the moments yield to me sweet   
 Feelings of contentment, but the human   
 Dies, and what I take for granted bears a name 
 To be forgotten soon, as the things I know   
 Turn into unfamiliar faces   
 In a strange room, leaving merely   
 A blank space, like a hole left in the wake   
 Of a perfect life, which closes over.

Thinking of Caroline Herschel (1750—1848) astronomer, sister of William; and others.
A woman in the shape of a monster   
a monster in the shape of a woman   
the skies are full of them 

a woman      ‘in the snow 
among the Clocks and instruments   
or measuring the ground with poles’ 

in her 98 years to discover   
8 comets 

she whom the moon ruled   
like us 
levitating into the night sky   
riding the polished lenses 

Galaxies of women, there 
doing penance for impetuousness   
ribs chilled   
in those spaces    of the mind 

An eye, 

          ‘virile, precise and absolutely certain’ 
          from the mad webs of Uranusborg 

                                                            encountering the NOVA   

every impulse of light exploding 

from the core 
as life flies out of us 

             Tycho whispering at last 
             ‘Let me not seem to have lived in vain’ 

What we see, we see   
and seeing is changing 

the light that shrivels a mountain   
and leaves a man alive 

Heartbeat of the pulsar 
heart sweating through my body 

The radio impulse   
pouring in from Taurus 

         I am bombarded yet         I stand 

I have been standing all my life in the   
direct path of a battery of signals 
the most accurately transmitted most   
untranslatable language in the universe 
I am a galactic cloud so deep      so invo- 
luted that a light wave could take 15   
years to travel through me       And has   
taken      I am an instrument in the shape   
of a woman trying to translate pulsations   
into images    for the relief of the body   
and the reconstruction of the mind.

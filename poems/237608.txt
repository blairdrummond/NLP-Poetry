title : The Sensible Girlfriend

for C.
Like shoes
 she chose for comfort,
 not for style,
 that fit her contours
 without chafe
 or blistering

 Here is sanity.
 It took her years to arrive,
 like an explorer
 settling at last
 into uneasy retirement,
 a small cottage
 at the edge of the sea.
 How the breakers crash
 against the underpinnings;
still, the walls hold firm.
 Hearth blazing steadily,
 she tries to warm to it

 tells herself
 she is mature now,
 this is good.
 The days of stalking,
 done,
 the rabid pulse,
 the blood-drenched kisses,
 all behind her now.
 Wearied, finally,
 of careless cruelties,
 she will stay here,
 grow old
 Â 
with you.
And, sensible,
 lacking her gift
 for self-deception,
 you know she struggles
 with devotion,
 you listen as she
 moans inside her dreams,
 and watch, without remarking,
 as she tracks the tap of high heels
just beyond the window,
 their rhythm growing fainter
with each step.

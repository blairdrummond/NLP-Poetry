title : Sweeping the States

author : Jacob Saenz

text : 
they move in swift on the Swift 
Plants in six states & sift 
through the faces to separate 
the dark from the light 

like meat & seat them in 
the back of vans packed tight 
like the product they pack 
& who's to pick up the slack 

the black & white can't cut it 
so the beef stacks sell single 
to feed the pack       the flock 
who block passages & clog 

the cogs of the machine       the process 
not so swift to give & grant a wish 
of a place       a stake in the land 
handling the steaks for the rest 

to take in       to sate the mouths 
of the stock who have stock 
in the business of beef & beef 
with the brown who ground them

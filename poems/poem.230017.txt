Couplet

From childhood's hour I have not been 
As others were--I have not seen 
As others saw--I could not bring 
My passions from a common spring-- 
From the same source I have not taken 
My sorrow--I could not awaken 
My heart to joy at the same tone-- 
And all I lov'd--I lov'd alone-- 
Then--in my childhood--in the dawn 
Of a most stormy life--was drawn 
From ev'ry depth of good and ill 
The mystery which binds me still-- 
From the torrent, or the fountain-- 
From the red cliff of the mountain-- 
From the sun that 'round me roll'd 
In its autumn tint of gold-- 
From the lightning in the sky 
As it pass'd me flying by-- 
From the thunder, and the storm-- 
And the cloud that took the form 
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
Of a demon in my view--

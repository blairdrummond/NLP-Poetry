title : Statueless Architecture

I passed through nature
 
into the next. Children
 
running in unsupervised shadows.
 
Last century’s fountains learning
 
not to lie. Risk
 
to identify with only
 
one element since one
 
will die but in
 
the summer air around
 
each thought, something is
 
built and avoided. You
 
go through an arch
 
and aren’t the arch,
 
just infinity of form,
 
curve’s curve of becoming,
 
a phrase tracking it
 
to future’s celadon relief.
 
As others dressed as
 
others we were supposed
 
to meet. Citizens walked
 
here without disappointment, seeing
 
no statue or palace
 
with eleven axes, patient
 
in the mindless heat—

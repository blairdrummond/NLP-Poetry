For Annie
You can come to me in the evening, 
            with the fingers of former lovers 
fastened in your hair and their ghost lips 
            opening over your body, 
They can be philosophers or musicians in long coats and colored shoes 
and they can be smarter than I am, 
            whispering to each other 
                        when they look at us. 
You can come walking toward my window after dusk 
            when I can’t see past the lamplight in the glass, 
when the chipped plates rattle on the counter 
            and the cinders 
dance on the cross-ties under the wheels of southbound freights. 
Bring children if you want, and the long wounds of sisters 
            branching away 
                        behind you toward the sea. 
Bring your mother’s tense distracted face 
                        and the shoulders of plane mechanics 
slumped in the Naugahyde booths of the airport diner, 
            waiting for you to bring their eggs. 

I’ll bring all the bottles of gin I drank by myself 
            and my cracked mouth opened partway 
as I slept in the back of my blue Impala 
                                                          dreaming of spiders. 
I won’t forget the lines running deeply 
            in the cheeks of the Polish landlady 
who wouldn’t let the cops upstairs, 
            the missing ring finger of the machinist from Spenard 
whose money I stole after he passed out to go downtown in a cab 
and look for whores, 
            or the trembling lower jaw of my son, watching me 
back my motorcycle from his mother’s driveway one last time, 
            the ribbons and cone-shaped birthday hats 
scattered on the lawn, 
                                  the rain coming down like broken glass. 

We’ll go out under the stars and sit together on the ground 
            and there will be enough to eat for everybody. 
They can sleep on my couches and rug, 
                                                         and the next day 
I’ll go to work, stepping easily across the scaffolding, feeding 
the cable gently into the new pipes on the roof, 
                                                                  and dreaming 
like St Francis of the still dark rocks 
that disappear under the morning tide, 
                                             only to climb back into the light, 
sea-rimed, salt-blotched, their patched webs of algae 
blazing with flies in the sun.

For Ira
With the seal of science 
emblazoned 
on your forehead, 
like the old Good Housekeeping 
Seal of Approval, 
I believe what you tell me 
about cells and molecules, 
though I can't see them. 

And though the language you speak 
is full of numbers and symbols 
I'll never understand; 
though your tie is askew 
and your hair unruly, still I believe 
what you say about the size of the universe, 
which is either expanding or contracting, 
I've forgotten which already. 

So if tomorrow you tell me 
you made a small miscalculation, 
that God indeed created the world 
in 6 short days, then rested on the 7th, 
that it was Eve who landed us 
in all this trouble, I would believe you. 
I would believe you 
as I've always done before.

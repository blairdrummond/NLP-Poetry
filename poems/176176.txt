title : Maybe It’s Only the Monotony

author : Gail Mazur

text : 
of these long scorching days   
but today my daughter   
is truly exasperating— 
Stop it! I shout—or I’ll— 
and I twist her little pinked arm 
slowly, 
calibrating my ferocity— 

You can’t hurt me you can’t hurt me! 
She’s so defiant, glowering, 
glaring at me— 
but frightened, 
her eyes bright with tears— 
See, I’m not even crying! 

I see. But it’s the angel 
of extermination 
I see, shining 
in his black trappings, 
and turning ecstatically 
toward him, a little Jewish girl   
tempts him 
to play his game of massacre.

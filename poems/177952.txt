title : A Pot of Red Lentils

simmers on the kitchen stove. 
All afternoon dense kernels 
surrender to the fertile 
juices, their tender bellies 
swelling with delight. 

In the yard we plant 
rhubarb, cauliflower, and artichokes, 
cupping wet earth over tubers, 
our labor the germ 
of later sustenance and renewal. 

Across the field the sound of a baby crying 
as we carry in the last carrots, 
whorls of butter lettuce, 
a basket of red potatoes. 

I want to remember us this wayâ€” 
late September sun streaming through 
the window, bread loaves and golden 
bunches of grapes on the table, 
spoonfuls of hot soup rising 
to our lips, filling us 
with what endures.

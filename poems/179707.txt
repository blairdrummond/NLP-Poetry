I could not disengage my world 
                               from the rest of humanity. 
                               Wind chill factor 11° below. All night 
wind thrashes barechested trees 
like a West Texas tent evangelist 
                               hissing them on his knees, 
                               lisping 
                                        sinnn . . . sinn . . . sinn . . . 
                                        All night wind preaches. 

Old tool shed 
behind my house 
fist-cuffs itself to nail-loose tin, 
horse pasture gates 
clank their crimes, 
while neighing black stallions of rain 
stampede on the patio 
fleeing gunshots of thunder . . . . 

Miles south of here, 
nightscopes pick up human heat 
that green fuzz helicopter 
dash panels. 
                  A mother whispers, 
      “Sssshhhh mejito, nomás poco más allá. 
                                 Nomás poco más allá.” 
Dunes of playing-dead people 
jack rabbit under strobe lights 
and cutting whack/blades, 
                  “Ssshhh mejito. 
                  Sssshhhh.” Child whimpers 
                  and staggers in blinding dust 
                  and gnashing wind. 

Those not caught, scratch sand up 
to sleep against underbellies 
of roots and stones. 

Eventually Juanito comes to my door, 
sick from eating stucco chips— 
his meals scratched off 
walls of temporary shelters, 
and Enrique, who guzzled water 
at industrial pipes 
pouring green foam out 
at the El Paso/Juarez border, 
and Maria steaming with fever, 
face dark meteorite, whispers, 
                  “Where I come from, Señor Baca, 
                  a woman’s womb is a rock, 
                  and children born from me, 
                  drop like stones, to become dust 
                  under death squad’s boots.” 

And Juanito, 
                  “They came at midnight 
                  and took my brothers. I have 
                  never seen them since. Each judge’s tongue 
                  is a bleeding stub of death, and each lawyer’s 
                  finger a soft coffin nail.” 

And Enrique, 
                  “You can trust no one. 
                  Each crying person’s eye is a damp cellar 
                  where thieves and murderers sleep.” 

They have found refuge here 
at Black Mesa. 

The sun passes between our lives, 
as between two trees, 
one gray, one green, 
but side by side.

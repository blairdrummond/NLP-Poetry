What are they looking for 
running to the summit of lost time? 

Hundreds of people vaporized 
instantly 
are walking mid-air 

We didn’t die 
we skipped over death in a flash we became spirits 

Give us a real a human death 
as if we’d existed 

not that this is less than a field of paper cranes 

the shadow of a man among hundreds 
engraved on stone steps 

Why am I printed on stone? 
Where did my flesh go, without its shadow? 

Where will shadow go 
no way up 
no down 
shadowing shadow on stone 

The 20th century is a myth 
frozen in fire— 
a woman’s fingers 
flare like candles,   
who will blow them out? 

Who will free this stone   
from its shadow? 

It isn’t that the threat of the bomb is great 
but that the earth is small 

how is it the 20th century passed 
. . .  leaving behind 
a rag of skin, on which 
the victim’s face appeared 

I’ve shed the face of a human being 
I’m stuck to a piece of gauze 
but that don’t stop me screaming 

Between my teeth uranium seeds 
In the dark of my nostrils 
cockroaches run to hide 
Back of my eyes helium glares 

The world is no more than a small rock 
soaked with the downpours of raging poisons 

the centuries are withering behind us 
as if they never existed 

I, too, am a tatter 
of burnt human creature 
tranced in strips of gauze 

beyond the horizon I hear 
my lost remains calling to me 

galaxies burning at the stake

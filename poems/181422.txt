title : Dream in Which I Love a Third Baseman

At first he seemed a child, 
dirt on his lip and the sun 
lighting up his hair behind him. 

All around us, the hesitation 
of year-rounders who know 
the warmer air will bring crowds. 

No one goes to their therapist 
to talk about how happy they are, 
but soon I’d be back in the dugout 

telling my batting coach how 
the view outside my igloo seemed 
to be changing, as if the night 

sky were all the light there is. 
Now, like two babies reaching 
through the watery air to touch soft 

fingers to soft forehead, like blind fish 
sensing a familiar fluttering in the waves, 
slowly, by instinct, we became aware. 

Off-field, outside the park, beyond 
the gates, something was burning.   
The smell was everywhere.

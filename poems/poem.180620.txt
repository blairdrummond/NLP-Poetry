Love, Desire, Infatuation & Crushes



I cry your mercy--pity--love! Aye, love!
   Merciful love that tantalizes not,
One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,
   Unmasked, and being seen--without a blot!
O! let me have thee whole,--all--all--be mine!
   That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest
Of love, your kiss,--those hands, those eyes divine,
   That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,--
Yourself--your soul--in pity give me all,
   Withhold no atom's atom or I die,
Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,
   Forget, in the mist of idle misery,
Life's purposes,--the palate of my mind
   Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!

For M.R.B.

Even past sunrise, frog legions peeped in spring
 where—as if for him—the creek jagged near.
 And yet from dawn, from spring, something was missing.
 There were quartzes and pyrites and schists and mica plates
 on the opposite scarp. They’d crackle. He would stir
 the back pool’s gathered algae with a stick
 till the world spun in a vortex that contained
 lights, quicksilver minnows, verdigris newts.
 And after, reflected riverside trees would shiver,
 their birds odd lapidary fruit that sang.
 His awkward schoolroom recitations seemed
 an age away. And yet there was something missing.
  
 The stars above the pastures of adolescence
 were profligate, scattered; and all the whispered words
 he traded with his friends, though banal, thrilled him.
 It was as if rich adulthood would take
 the form of speech, as if to talk enough
 to companions would be to lisp his way to treasure,
 various as those stars, or the sighs and chippings 
 of amorous insects, nightbirds, rodents, cattle,
 or summer timothy stalks, or breezes panting
 warmly. He recalls how their radio crooned
 “Shangri-la,” “Rags to Riches,” whatever.
 Rifeness was all. But there was an absence too.
  
 Later he learned the words, the syntax, moods
 of another language. Still later he found himself
 high in the Pyrenees, unsponsored, free.
 He had no cash, but could speak and charm no less
 than Monsieur le maire, who accepted his draft and poured
 coin from the hamlet’s coffers and poured him wine.
 They leaned out over a rail to see September’s
 shatter of water on rocks in the gorge below.
 Then mayor and manchild stumbled house to house—
 he remembers the musical speeches of introduction,
 as if the boy himself were somehow a treasure.
 Copious tears at parting, then something missing
  
 All through the long, olfactory ramble north:
 meadow-scent, soft coal, diesel’s perfumes,
 sawdust-and-urine whiff in the tiny relais,
 Gauloises, cheroots, and, once in Paris, cassis.
 Liquor-courageous, he nodded to the lady.
 And then, upstairs, the spirits fading, he bellowed,
 to mask his shyness, “I have had enough!”
 “J’en ai marre!” To which she replied, “De quoi?”
 Mute, he handed over what money was left
 from the mayor’s store, and mortified waited outside
 on the balcony, its grillwork broken by light.
 He though, “De quoi?” Exactly. Enough of what?
  
 Trout, platooned and hungry in western Montana,
 the gilded browns, the rainbows more than rainbows,
 the cutthroats’ cheek-plates crimson as any wound:
 breaking the flawless surface, flawless themselves,
 they arched their backs and sipped his little fly
 with its tinsel and feather, never so lovely as they were.
 Coyotes sang the sun to splendid disaster.
 It fell on the rim of the mesa, imploding in flame,
 across which flew the tuneful, crop-full geese
 while black hawks wheeled, while great bull elk came forth
 to bugle challenge, courtship down the buttes,
 which shone like mercury now. And something missing,
  
 Something that failed as well to show from ice
 outside his house, New Hampshire. Within, soft groans
 from his ancient timbers. His clothing snapped with static.
 One songless nuthatch lit to taste his feeder.
 It seemed that nature vanished into mind,
 that pool and pasture, mountain and minnow, frogs,
 odors, effects of touch and sound and light
 had each become mere object of recall. 
 The newest New Year passed and seemed not new,
 but raced to retrospection, as would spring
 and summer and autumn, so he though, like winter
 missed something. He could he know you
  
 would come, and come the day of which he sings?
 Has gone on singing. Will go on to sing.

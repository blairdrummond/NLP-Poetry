title : A College Room: Lowell R-34, 1945

author : L. E. Sissman

text : 
A single bed. A single room. I sing
 Of man alone on the skew surface of life.
 No kith, no kin, no cat, no kid, no wife,
 No Frigidaire, no furniture, no ring.
  
 Yes, but the perfect state of weightlessness
 Is a vacuum the natural mind abhors:
 The strait bed straightway magnetizes whores;
 The bare room, aching, itches to possess.
  
 Thus I no sooner shut the tan tin door
 Behind me than I am at once at home.
 Will I, nill I, a budget pleasure dome
 Will rear itself in Suite R-34.
  
 A pleasure dome of Klees and Watteaus made,
 Of chairs and couches from the Fair Exchange,
 Of leavings from the previous rich and strange
 Tenant, of fabrics guaranteed to fade.
  
 Here I will entertain the young idea
 Of Cambridge, wounded, winsome, and sardonic;
 Here I will walk the uttermost euphonic
 Marches of English, where no lines are clear.
  
 Here I will take the interchangeable
 Parts of ephemerid girls to fit my bed;
 Here death will first enter my freshman head
 On a visitor’s passport, putting one tangible
  
 Word in my mouth, a capsule for the day
 When I will be evicted from my home
 Suite home so full of life and damned to roam
 Bodiless and without a thing to say.



 Footnote: Mrs. Circassian

 An orphan home. But into this eclectic
 Mass of disasters sails Mrs. Circassian,
 Maid without parallel, queen beyond question
 Of household gods, gas and electric.
  
 She puts the room right with a basilisk
 Look, pats it into shape like a pillow;
 Under her hard hand, the Chinese willow
 Learns how to live with an abstraction. Risk
  
 All and win all is her maiden motto,
 Which makes mere matter fall into its place,
 Dress right and form platoons to save its face,
 And suffers Pollock to lie down with Watteau.

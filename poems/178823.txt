title : Dirge at the Edge of Woods

text : 
Gold shed upon suckling gold,   
The time of the bole blackens, 
Of the dark mounted through dapple,   
While in the sealed apple   
The seed cradled toward cold.   
A gold on gold spent, 
Put by from an elm in its years   
Now its gilded of days, 
Over turf’s dishevelment; 
Where all which is green sickens,   
All the fresh shall be sere.   
All which is green sickens,   
And it is but for a time 
Those embered veinings blaze   
A year’s delirium; 
Or neared of other space,   
Unportioned azure shall close   
One of more, and which is,   
One which goes. 
Let the little pupils that will,   
Of vision, gaze for salt 
To whet their gazing, wit   
In one weather is high 
From burrow and lair, by   
Nether providences’ default   
An all’s accrued. 
And apposite, beyond 
Such primer beholdings, has   
Its long accounting known 

The beetle’s morsel thus 
Was rich, and the slug’s bed on   
The oak’s generations, deep   
Over the lark’s bones. 
In slough of Edens fast 
Wit in one weather shall stand,   
While millennia nibble at   
The sensual apple 
Toppled it net, 
Plenty in the palm of the hand,   
And the fallen not fallen, not lost   
From out its certitude— 
For our unbeggaring 
Has been gross. Few and late   
To cherish an immoderate   
Wish, hope’s calculus,   
Love’s hope; few to miss,   
From natural tally thrust,   
In the lime-girdled space   
Of choice, where alone   
Man can abandon what   
Is only his own; 
And in cold and tarrying   
Their rearisers sleep: 

While to the granite cheek   
Light’s purples bring 
Infinite their ministering,   
And past our finial 
And ragged crests, to keep 
Time’s ambient stood, 
Propose horizons from 
Their shadowy quarries; while,   
In an unwandered wood, 
Or under the indifferent foot,   
Is let fall, let fall a fruit,   
Through eternal leisures down,   
For but time’s unravelling.

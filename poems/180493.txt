title : The Sweater of Vladimir Ussachevsky

author : John Haines

text : 
Facing the wind of the avenues 
one spring evening in New York, 
I wore under my thin jacket 
a sweater given me by the wife 
of a genial Manchurian. 

The warmth in that sweater changed 
the indifferent city block by block. 
The buildings were mountains 
that fled as I approached them. 

The traffic became sheep and cattle 
milling in muddy pastures. 
I could feel around me the large 
movements of men and horses. 

It was spring in Siberia or Mongolia, 
wherever I happened to be. 
Rough but honest voices called to me 
out of that solitude: 
they told me we are all tired 
of this coiling weight, 
the oppression of a long winter; 
that it was time to renew our life, 
burn the expired contracts, 
elect new governments. 

The old Imperial sun has set, 
and I must write a poem to the Emperor. 
I shall speak it like the man 
I should be, an inhabitant of the frontier, 
clad in sweat-darkened wool, 
my face stained by wind and smoke. 

Surely the Emperor and his court 
will want to know what a fine 
and generous revolution begins tomorrow 
in one of his remote provinces...

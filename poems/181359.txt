All my life 
I was face to face 
with her, at meal-times, 
by the fire, even 
in the ultimate intimacies 
of the bed. You could have asked, 
then, for information 
about her? There was a room 
apart she kept herself in, 
teasing me by leading me 
to its glass door, only 
to confront me with 
my reflection. I learned from her 
even so. Walking her shore 
I found things cast up 
from her depths that spoke 
to me of another order, 
worshipper as I was 
of untamed nature. She fetched 
her treasures from art’s 
storehouse: pieces of old 
lace, delicate as frost; 
china from a forgotten 
period; a purse more valuable 
than anything it could contain. 
Coming in from the fields 
with my offering of flowers 
I found her garden 
had forestalled me in providing 
civilities for my desk. 
‘Tell me about life,’ 
I would say, ‘you who were 
its messenger in the delivery 
of our child.’ Her eyes had a 
fine shame, remembering her privacy 
being invaded from further off than 
she expected. ‘Do you think 
death is the end?’ frivolously 
I would ask her. I recall 
now the swiftness of its arrival 
wrenching her lip down, and how 
the upper remained firm, 
reticent as the bud that is 
the precursor of the flower.

title : The Book of Failed Descriptions

author : Tod Marshall

text : 
Myth is prison, a palace,
 truth without fact.
  
 Myth is birth and pleasure, teeth and death,
               sharp shiver of that which is broken.
  
 Myth is patriarchal and worn,
               full of fratricide and rape.
  
 Myth is a garden, makes good television,
               memoir,
               the scandal of animals
               and people
               coupling beneath the stars.
  
 Myth is crow eating roadkill and dodging the occasional cars,
               a pile of guts and bones.
  
 Myth is carrying the body back to the den.
  
                             –Close your eyes and count to ten.

 “In language, there are always two.”
  
 The Iliad
 stolen from Thoreau’s cabin,
 the only thing taken
 during those years.
 Remember, too, The Aenied
 (we all have lived
 through times of war)
 and that passage
 a friend said to know well,
 “Learn fortitude and toil from me, my son,
 Ache of true toil. Good fortune learn from others.”

 Ultrasound images of my heart.
 That it moves and moves
 and then moves again,
 plump muscle
 shuddering, laboring
 to make up for one bad valve.
  
 Spots in the ocean
 where nothing lives
 and yet there is movement,
 water moving.
  
 I stand in the river
 fishing and watching an osprey
 slide through the air
 ten feet above the water.
  
 I hear those wings.

 Eleven years of loving
 can’t just vanish. I have photographs.
 I have facts. “Hapy Birthday
 Dady” scribbled on a card.
  
               How easy to sit at a desk
               and not see the full moon
               through the window.
  
               Roy Sullivan, Virginia Park Ranger,
               struck by lightning seven times,
               kills himself after being dumped by a lover.
  
               “Present fears are less than horrible imaginings.”
  
 A friend asks, “Why are you hiding in myth?”

 I gather a lock of his hair,
 a scrap of T-shirt, a baby tooth,
 his tiny spoon, a diaper pin with a blue plastic stork,
 the quilted blanket, his first steps,
 hands clutching my fingers, the long night
 when his fever rose to 104˚,
 his split lip at age six when he jumped with outspread
 arms, the first shoe, a locket with a toddler photo,
 first day of school, first finger painting,
 the green cardboard sculpture
 like something shaped by Breton, T-ball
 games, the flopping trout he squeezed too hard,
 his first broken bone, his fear when he felt
 my trembling hands trying to tell him
 something about the sun.

 Trout with a slashed back
 where talons tore dorsal flesh
 and the flesh slipped
 from an osprey’s grip
 to a lucky landing
 in the creek’s waiting water,
 thrashing and calming,
 lingering beneath a deep cutbank,
 and weeks later,
 taking my elk hair caddis
 and leaping 
 completely out of the water.
  
 On the far bank, a muskrat
 struggles and does a melodramatic gangster fall
 into the creek where it splashes
 and sinks. “Rattlesnake,”
 my friend says, and I nod
 and stare at where the ripple
 swirls into the current
  
 and think about sinking bones.

 The court acknowledges the petitioner’s long involvement with
 ____________’s like and sincerely hopes that the parties involved
 will have the generosity and wisdom to honor that relationship.
  
 Do not blame the wind
 that scatters apple blossoms
 ruthlessly. Allow that flowers
 desire farewell blessings
 before their time has come.

 Fishing in the desert creek
 a few days after the hearing,
 I find bones, steer skulls
 with round sockets for horns,
 and step near three rattlesnakes,
 almost grab a fourth
 when climbing a steep bank.
 The snakes were sluggish, though,
 late spring when the temperatures
 in the desert dipped into the thirties
 at night. Only one rattled,
 and the rain of the previous days
 made the fishing terrible, water brown
 and swift. I didn’t get a bite
 and drove home, bought
 a bucket of fried chicken,
 and ate in front of the television
 his clothes still hanging in a closet.
  


8.
  
 There is no 
 end to the hours 
 when cedars and peaks
 scratch the sky’s belly.
 No garden,
 but sometimes, wildflowers.
 Sometimes, fish hold against
 the river’s current
 then dart with a silvery
 flash downstream.
 Sometimes, deer
 on the other shore
 stand still
 for a moment,
 then hunch toward
 their grazing.

A birthday party and he’ll have nothing to do with the inflatable  castles rented and set up on the lawn, only wants to run all afternoon, playing chase, tag-like game where I growl and laugh and lumber around the playground, his giggling, both of us laughing and roaring, and I catch him and he gets away and climbs to the top of the jungle gym where he looks at me with worry, and I know that the game is on break, that this is real, and I walk beneath him and he doesn’t pause. He jumps into my arms, and I catch him.

 Ready or not
                 here I come—
  
  
 A feather floats downstream,
  
 the rings of a ripple smooth.
  
 Love is possible. The heron
  
 hunts in the shallows with slow
  
 deliberate steps, startles 
  
 from the creek, and rises.
  
 Sunlight warms basalt walls
  
 fields of sage, and Hawthorne
  
 groves, here, where tumble-
  
 weeds rove for home.

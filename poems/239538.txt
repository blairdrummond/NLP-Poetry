Prostrating before the golden figure
 Against disinclination…later in the day…
 All that remains…the extremely brittle foliage…
 Abated, the thunder…our golden figure…
 Her ugly hair held back by a pin…frenzied
 Rushed down the forested hill that isolates sun
 Highly explosive, flickering, foiling of your heightening hushed
 Nick in the blue thing
 Along negligence
  
 Chagrin
 Of the maidens
 Bleeds
  
 Shackled as sharp complication
 Being as it were
 Absorbed into
 Myth
 Whiten, whitening
 Or white on white display
  
 That play
 That combusted
 On stage
  
 Romulus
 & Remus
  
 The Janus figure
 From Zaire

title : Study/Trees

author : Leonard Gontarek

text : 
Leaves flare up, kitchen matches 
in the permanent trees. 
Black flash of pike on Mirror Lake, dropping 
like a roll of nickels. I don’t want nudes 
in paintings, I don’t want Beauty through the heart,   
small harpoon that opens when pulled out. 
I want to break another eggroll with you in moonlight. 
Ugly maples, when you’re gone.

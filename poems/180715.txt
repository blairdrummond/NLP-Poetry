title : At the Wedding March

author : Gerard Manley Hopkins

text : 
God with honour hang your head, 
Groom, and grace you, bride, your bed 
With lissome scions, sweet scions, 
Out of hallowed bodies bred. 

Each be other’s comfort kind: 
Déep, déeper than divined, 
Divine charity, dear charity, 
Fast you ever, fast bind. 

Then let the March tread our ears: 
I to him turn with tears   
Who to wedlock, his wonder wedlock, 
Déals tríumph and immortal years.

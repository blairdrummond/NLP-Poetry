title : Chinese Quatrains (The Woman in Tomb 44)

author : Marilyn Chin

text : 
The aeroplane is shaped like a bird
 Or a giant mechanical penis
 My father escorts my mother
 From girlhood to unhappiness
  

 A dragonfly has iridescent wings
 Shorn, it’s a lowly pismire
 Plucked of arms and legs
 A throbbing red pepperpod

 
 Baby, she’s a girl
 Pinkly propped as a doll
 Baby, she’s a pearl
 An ulcer in the oyster of God

 
 Cry little baby clam cry
 The steam has opened your eyes
 Your secret darkly hidden
 The razor is sharpening the knife
  

 Abandoned taro-leaf boat
 Its lonely black sail broken
 The corpses are fat and bejeweled
 The hull is thoroughly rotten

 
 The worm has entered the ear
 And out the nose of my father
 Cleaned the pelvis of my mother
 And ringed around her fingerbone
  

 One child beats a bedpan
 One beats a fishhook out of wire
 One beats his half sister on the head
 Oh, teach us to fish and love
  

 Don’t say her boudoir is too narrow
 She could sleep but in one cold bed
 Don’t say you own many horses
 We escaped on her skinny mare’s back

 
 Man is good said Meng-Tzu
 We must cultivate their natures
 Man is evil said Hsun-Tzu
 There’s a worm in the human heart

 
 He gleaned a beaded purse from Hong Kong
 He procured an oval fan from Taiwan
 She married him for a green card
 He abandoned her for a blonde
  

 My grandmother is calling her goslings
 My mother is summoning her hens
 The sun has vanished into the ocean
 The moon has drowned in the fen

 
 Discs of jade for her eyelids
 A lozenge of pearl for her throat
 Lapis and kudzu in her nostrils
 They will rob her again and again

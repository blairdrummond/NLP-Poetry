title : Murray Dreaming

author : Stephen Edgar

text : 
It’s not the sharks 
Sliding mere inches from his upturned face 
Through warps of water where the tunnel arcs 
Transparent overhead, 
Their lipless jaws clamped shut, extruding teeth, 
Their eyes that stare at nothing, like the dead, 
Staring at him; it’s not the eerie grace 
Of rays he stood beneath, 
Gaping at their entranced slow-motion chase 

That is unending; 
It’s not the ultra-auditory hum 
Of ET cuttlefish superintending 
The iridescent craft   
Of their lit selves, as messages were sent, 
Turning the sight of him they photographed 
To code: it is not this that left him dumb 
With schoolboy wonderment 
Those hours he wandered the aquarium. 

It is that room, 
That room of Murray River they had walled 
In glass and, deep within the shifting gloom 
And subtle drifts of sky 
That filtered down, it seemed, from the real day 
Of trees and bird light many fathoms high, 
The giant Murray cod that was installed 
In stillness to delay 
All that would pass. The boy stood there enthralled. 

Out in the day 
Again, he saw the famous streets expound 
Their theories about speed, the cars obey, 
Racing to catch the sun, 
The loud fast-forward crowds, and thought it odd 
That in the multitudes not everyone 
Should understand as he did the profound 
Profession of the cod, 
That held time, motionless, unknown to sound. 

In bed at night, 
Are his eyes open or is this a dream? 
The room is all dark water, ghosted light, 
And midway to the ceiling 
The great fish with its working fins and gills 
Suspended, while before it glide the reeling 
And see-through scenes of day, faintly agleam, 
Until their passage stills 
And merges with the deep unmoving stream.

Snow: 
years of anger following 
hours that float idly down -- 
the blizzard 
drifts its weight 
deeper and deeper for three days 
or sixty years, eh? Then 
the sun! a clutter of 
yellow and blue flakes -- 
Hairy looking trees stand out 
in long alleys 
over a wild solitude. 
The man turns and there -- 
his solitary track stretched out 
upon the world.

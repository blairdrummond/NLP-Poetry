title : For My Wife Cutting My Hair

author : Bruce Guernsey

You move around me expertly like the good, round 
Italian barber I went to in Florence, 
years before we met, his scissors 
a razor he sharpened on a belt.

But at first when you were learning, I feared 
for my neck, saw my ears like sliced fruit 
on the newspapered floor. Taking us back in time, 
you cleverly clipped my head in a flat-top.

The years in between were styles no one had ever seen, 
or should see again: when the wind rose 
half my hair floated off in feathers, 
the other half bristling, brief as a brush.

In the chair, almost asleep, I hear the bright 
scissors dancing. Hear you hum, full-breasted as Aida, 
carefully trimming the white from my temples, 
so no one, not even I, will know.

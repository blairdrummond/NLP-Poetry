title : Cicada

author : Fred Marchant

text : 
That whine is the sound
 of waste, rot, the frantic,
 grinding inability to attend
 to anything but sere thwarting
 of yourself, a dry corrosion
 which some say they know,
 but you and I—
  
 (my jaw clenched as you
 turn a page,
 you with a heart like drywall,
 I who would
 lace my arms with razors,
 then press them
 slowly to your lips,
 the metal taste
 mixing with flesh,
 and through gritted teeth
 I making the sound
 of you, you, you
 do not know, meaning
 only me, me)
  
 we know best.

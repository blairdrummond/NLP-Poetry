title : my dream about time

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
a woman unlike myself is running
 down the long hall of a lifeless house
 with too many windows which open on
 a world she has no language for,
 running and running until she reaches
 at last the one and only door
 which she pulls open to find each wall
 is faced with clocks and as she watches
 all of the clocks strike
                                              NO

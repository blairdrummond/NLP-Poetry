title : from Canto CXV

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
The scientists are in terror 
             and the European mind stops
 Wyndham Lewis chose blindness
             rather than have his mind stop. 
 Night under wind mid garofani,
             the petals are almost still
 Mozart, Linnaeus, Sulmona,
 When one’s friends hate each other 
             how can there be peace in the world?
 Their asperities diverted me in my green time. 
 A blown husk that is finished
             but the light sings eternal
 a pale flare over marshes
                 where the salt hay whispers to tide’s change
 Time, space,
           neither life nor death is the answer. 
 And of man seeking good,
             doing evil.
 In meiner Heimat
                    where the dead walked
                               and the living were made of cardboard.

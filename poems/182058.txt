They landed and could 
    see nothing but 
    meadows and tall 
    trees— 
cypress, nearly three 
    fathoms about at the 
    roots, 
rising straight for 
    sixty or eighty feet 
    without a branch. 
In the woods were 
    cedars, oaks, and 
    walnut trees; 
some beech, some elm, 
    black walnut, ash, 
    and sassafras; mul- 
    berry trees in 
    groves; 
honey-suckle and 
    other vines hanging   
    in clusters on 
    many trees. 
They stepped on 
    violets and other 
    sweet flowers, 
many kinds in many 
    colors; straw- 
    berries and rasp- 
    berries were on 
    the ground. 
Blackbirds with red 
    shoulders were 
    flying about 
and many small birds, 
    some red, some blue; 
the woods were full of deer; 
and running 
    everywhere 
    fresh water— 
    brooks, rundles, 
    springs and creeks. 
In the twilight, 
    through the thickets 
    and tall grass, 
creeping upon all 
    fours—the 
    savages, their 
    bows in their 
    mouths.

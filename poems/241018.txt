title : Meeting at an Airport

author : Taha Muhammad Ali

You asked me once,
 on our way back
 from the midmorning
 trip to the spring:
 “What do you hate,
 and who do you love?”
  
 And I answered,
 from behind the eyelashes
 of my surprise,
 my blood rushing
 like the shadow
 cast by a cloud of starlings:
 “I hate departure . . .
 I love the spring
 and the path to the spring,
 and I worship the middle
 hours of morning.”
 And you laughed . . .
 and the almond tree blossomed
 and the thicket grew loud with nightingales.
  
 . . . A question 
 now four decades old:
 I salute that question’s answer;
 and an answer
 as old as your departure;
 I salute that answer’s question . . .
  
 And today,
 it’s preposterous,
 here we are at a friendly airport
 by the slimmest of chances,
 and we meet.
 Ah, Lord!
 we meet.
 And here you are
 asking—again,
 it’s absolutely preposterous—
 I recognized you
 but you didn’t recognize me.
 “Is it you?!”
 But you wouldn’t believe it.
 And suddenly 
 you burst out and asked:
 “If you’re really you,
 What do you hate
 and who do you love?!”
  
 And I answered—
 my blood
 fleeing the hall,
 rushing in me
 like the shadow
 cast by a cloud of starlings:
 “I hate departure,
 and I love the spring,
and the path to the spring,
 and I worship the middle
 hours of morning.”
  
 And you wept,
 and flowers bowed their heads,
 and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled.

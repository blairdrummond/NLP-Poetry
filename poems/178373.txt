title : Song After Campion

author : Robert Fitzgerald

text : 
Ravished lute, sing to her virgin ears,   
Soft notes thy strings repeating; 
Plucked harp, whose amorous song she hears,   
Tell her the time is fleeting; 
Night-tide and my distress of love 
O speak, sweet numbers, 
That pity her heart may move 
Before she slumbers. 

Pale moth, that from the moon doth fly,   
Fickle enchantments weaving, 
Night faery, come my lady nigh 
When the rich masques are leaving;   
Tell her who lieth still alone 
Love is a treasure 
Fair as the frail lute’s tone 
And perished measure.

title : Daffodils

—for David Lehman   Ten thousand saw I at a glance  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.  —William Wordsworth   Going to hell so many times tears it  Which explains poetry.  —Jack Spicer 
The day the war against Iraq begins 
I’m photographing the yellow daffodils 
With their outstretched arms and ruffled cups 
Blowing in the wind of Jesus Green 

Edging the lush grassy moving river 
Along with the swans and ducks 
Under a soft March Cambridge sky 
Embellishing the earth like a hand 

Starting to illustrate a children’s book 
Where people in light clothes come out 
To play, to frisk and run about 
With their lovers, friends, animals, and children 

As down every stony back road of history 
They’ve always done in the peaceful springs 
—Which in a sense is also hell because 
The daffodils do look as if they dance 

And make some of us in the park want to dance 
And breathe deeply and I know that 
Being able to eat and incorporate beauty like this 
I am privileged and by that token can 

Taste pain, roll it on my tongue, it’s good 
The cruel wars are good the stupidity is good, 
The primates hiding in their caves are very good, 
They do their best, which explains poetry. 

What explains poetry is that life is hard 
But better than the alternatives, 
The no and the nothing. Look at this light 
And color, a splash of brilliant yellow 

Punctuating an emerald text, white swans 
And mottled brown ducks floating quietly along 
Whole and alive, like an untorn language 
That lacks nothing, that excludes 

Nothing. Period. Don’t you think 
It is our business to defend it 
Even the day our masters start a war? 
To defend the day we see the daffodils?

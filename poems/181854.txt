title : The Composer’s Winter Dream

author : Norman Dubie

text : 
for my father
Vivid and heavy, he strolls through dark brick kitchens 
Within the great house of Esterhazy: 
A deaf servant’s candle 
Is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about 
The green kindling! The wassail is 
Being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles 

Over thirty baked apples in a large bowl: into 
The wassail, young girls empty their aprons of 
Cinnamon, ground mace, and allspice berries. A cook adds 
Egg whites and brandy. The giant glass snifters 
On a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids. 
The anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig 

Stuffed with Devonshire cream. In the sinks the gallbladders 
Of geese are soaking in cold salted water. 
Walking in the storm, this evening, he passed 
Children in rags, singing carols; they were roped together 
In the drifting snow outside the palace gate. 
He knew he would remember those boys’ faces. . . 

There’s a procession into the kitchens: larger boys, each 
With a heavy shoe of coal. The pianist sits and looks 
Hard at a long black sausage. He will not eat 

Before playing the new sonata. Beside him 
The table sags with hams, kidney pies, and two shoulders 
Of lamb. A hand rings a bell in the parlor! 

No longer able to hide, he walks 
Straight into the large room that blinds him with light. 
He sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries. . . 
The simple sonata which 

He is playing has little 
To do with what he’s feeling: something larger 
Where a viola builds, in air, an infinite staircase. 
An oboe joins the viola, they struggle 
For a more florid harmony.   
But the silent violins now emerge 

And, like the big wing of a bird, smother everything 
In a darkness from which only a single horn escapes— 
That feels effaced by the composer’s dream. . . 
But he is not dreaming, 
The composer is finishing two performances simultaneously! 

He is back in the dark kitchens, sulking and counting 
His few florins—they have paid him 
With a snuffbox that was pressed 
With two diamonds, in Holland! 
This century discovers quinine. 
And the sketchbooks of a mad, sad musician 

Who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside 
A critic. He screamed: Here, take the snuffbox, I’ve filled 
It with the dander of dragons! He apologizes 
The next morning, instructing the landlord to take 
This stuff (Da Ist Der Wisch) to a publisher, 
And sell it! You'll have your velvet garters, Pig! 

The composer is deaf, loud, and feverish. . . he went 
To the countryside in a wet sedan chair. 
He said to himself: for the piper, seventy ducats! He’d curse 
While running his fingers through his tousled hair, he made 
The poor viola climb the stairs. 
He desired loquats, loquats with small pears!   

Ludwig, there are Spring bears under the pepper trees! 
The picnic by the stone house. . . the minnows 
Could have been sunlight striking fissures 
In the stream; Ludwig, where your feet are 
In the cold stream 
Everything is horizontal like the land and living. 

The stream saying, “In the beginning was the word 
And without the word 
Was not anything made that was made. . . 
But let us believe in the word, Ludwig, 
For it is like the sea grasses 
Off which with giant snails eat, at twilight!” But then 

The dream turns to autumn; the tinctures he 
Swallows are doing nothing for him, and he shows 
The physicians his spoon which has dissolved 
In the mixtures the chemist has given him! 
After the sonata was heard: the standing for applause 
Over, he walked out where it was snowing. 

It had been dark early that evening. It’s here that the 
Dream becomes shocking: he sees a doctor 
In white sleeves 
Who is sawing at the temporal bones of his ears. There is 
A bag of dampened plaster for the death mask. And 
Though he is dead, a pool of urine runs to the 

Middle of the sickroom. A brass urinal is on the floor, it is 
The shape of his ears rusting on gauze. The doctors 

Drink stale wassail. They frown over the dead Beethoven. Outside, 
The same March storm that swept through Vienna an hour before 
Has turned in its tracks like the black, caged panther 
On exhibit in the Esterhazys’ candlelit ballroom. The storm crosses 
Over Vienna once more: lightning strikes the Opera House, its eaves 
And awnings filled with hailstones, 

Flames leaping to the adjacent stables! Someone had known, 
As thunder dropped flower boxes off windowsills, 
Someone must have known 
That, at this moment, the violins would emerge 
In a struggle with the loud, combatant horns.

Just wasted
                     and taking it.
        In life
               I rally
                        constantly.
                 Effort is what we 
               breach. And
                    accountability.
                 Honed limits
                   do you require
                        ruthlessness or subtlety?
                                           The # for that delivery service
                                                                I could find. My 
                                                                     instinct is to agree
                                                                with the collective.
                                                                         I’ll flip over
                                                               their indoor/outdoor
                                                         reversible rug.
                                                                 But my feelings
                                                                     & their representatives
                                                                   the passing sacrosanct
                                                                   mob cuddle
                                                            stirring expedience
                                 are mine. Gradations
                                                       of default tenor.
                                                    Anything but more instinct.
                                                      A proxy of determination
                                                  in a cosmic discharge salon
                                             speaking freely of cost’s 
                                    elephantine deployable
                            former charm.
                                 I’m micromanaging nausea.
                                        The dishes are twilighting.
                                             The dairy scythe elevatrix
                                                              skins my shining
                                                         teleprompted sporkdom.
                                                       As poor specimens
                                                                        go, the trail left
                                                                 inhabitable trails.
                                                            Arkanoid as meditative
                                          space, if we travel by
                              dragonfly. I cling
                          to thy moving perimeter.
                   I want payment
                          for all instances
                              of being caught
                              on camera. We 
                                       all should.
                                            Mutually
                              assured destruction
                                   overdosed on civility
                                     by comparison.
                                          Babywiping lead paint
                                           dust from my soles.
                                                 I’ll read entrails
                                           for omens, action
                                                                 figure entrails.

U.S., New, England
Living, Infancy, Death, Sorrow & Grieving



Death found strange beauty on that cherub brow, 
And dash'd it out. - There was a tint of rose 
O'er cheek and lip; - he touch'd the veins with ice, 
And the rose faded. - Forth from those blue eyes 
There spake a wistful tenderness, - a doubt 
Whether to grieve or sleep, which Innocence   
Alone can wear. - With ruthless haste he bound 
The silken fringes of their curtaining lids 
Forever. - There had been a murmuring sound 
With which the babe would claim its mother's ear, 
Charming her even to tears. - The spoiler set 
His seal of silence. - But there beam'd a smile, 
So fix'd and holy from that marble brow, -
Death gazed and left it there; - he dared not steal 
The signet-ring of Heaven.

I know I promised to stop 
talking about her, 
but I was talking to myself. 
The truth is, she’s a child 
who stopped growing, 
so I’ve always allowed her 
to tag along, and when she brings 
her melancholy close to me 
I comfort her. Naturally 
you’re curious; you want to know 
how she became a gnarled branch 
veiled in diminutive blooms. 
But I’ve told you all I know. 
I was sure she had secrets, 
but she had no secrets. 
I had to tell her mine.

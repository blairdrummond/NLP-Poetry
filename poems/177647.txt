title : When in Wisconsin Where I Once Had Time

When in Wisconsin where I once had time   
the flyway swans came whistling 
to the rotten Green Bay ice and stayed, 
not feeding, four days, maybe five, I shouted 

and threw stones to see them fly. 
Blue herons followed, or came first. 
I shot a bittern’s wing off with my gun.   
For that my wife could cry. 

My neighbor’s wife mistook the spawning frogs   
for wood ducks nesting the white pines   
up on Bean Hill: I straightway 
set her right. Each April, on the first 

rainy night I lantern-hunt for salamanders   
where they hide, toewalking the bottom   
mucks and muds. I shudder 
at the scored skin of their sides, the deep 

flesh tucks. In hand, they dry. I walk 
in frogspawn jellies on my lawns. One time I hoped   
the great white birds might brake 
for the frog ditch and alight, 

but all the addled past falls in on itself,   
splash rings close inward on the rising stone,   
my gun sucks fire, the bone becomes 
whole bone, light narrows back 

on point and filament, the forest turns to sand,   
and only season lacking source rolls round 
and round, till I in my turns fall forever back   
clutching my stone, my gun, my light. 

When in Wisconsin where I once had time 
and spring beasts gorged my marrows and my tongue,   
I was not blind: the red eft clambered 
in my eye.

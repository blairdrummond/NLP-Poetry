Rhymed Stanza

                Holiness on the head, 
         Light and perfections on the breast, 
Harmonious bells below, raising the dead 
         To lead them unto life and rest: 
                Thus are true Aarons drest. 

                Profaneness in my head, 
         Defects and darkness in my breast, 
A noise of passions ringing me for dead 
         Unto a place where is no rest: 
                Poor priest, thus am I drest. 

                Only another head 
         I have, another heart and breast, 
Another music, making live, not dead, 
         Without whom I could have no rest: 
                In him I am well drest. 

                Christ is my only head, 
         My alone-only heart and breast, 
My only music, striking me ev'n dead, 
         That to the old man I may rest, 
                And be in him new-drest. 

                So, holy in my head, 
         Perfect and light in my dear breast, 
My doctrine tun'd by Christ (who is not dead, 
         But lives in me while I do rest), 
                Come people; Aaron's drest.

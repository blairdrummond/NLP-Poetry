Sleepless 
 in the cold dark, 
I look 
 through the closed dim 
 door be- 
fore me, which be- 
 comes an 
 abyss into 
 which my 
 memories have 
 fallen 
 past laughter or 
horror, 
 passion or hard 
workâ€”my 
 memories of 
 our past 
laughter, horror, 
 passion, 
 hard work. An ache 
of be- 
 ing. An ache of 
being, 
 over love. An 
 ache of 
being over 
 love. Like 
projections on 
 the screen 
 of the heavy 
window 
curtains, flashing 
lights of 
 a slow-scraping 
 after- 
midnight snowplow 
 for a 
 moment pulse in 
 this room.

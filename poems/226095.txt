(to JK)
Those scars rooted me. Stigmata stalagmite 
I sat at a drive-in and watched the stars 
Through a straw while the Coke in my lap went 
Waterier and waterier. For days on end or 

Nights no end I crawled on all fours or in 
My case no fours to worship you: Amoeba Behemoth. 
—Then you explained your DNA calls for 
Meaner genes than mine and since you are merely 

So to speak its external expression etcet 
Ergo among your lovers I’ll never be ... 
Ah that movie was so faraway the stars melting 

Made my thighs icy. I see: it’s not you 
Who is not requiting me, it’s something in you 
Over which you have no say says no to me.

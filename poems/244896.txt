     Thanks, Ray, this is just what the doctor ordered.
  
      No, you never see me have one with olives—your father likes
 olives but I can’t stand them.
  
      No, cocktail onions are just picked small. Turn that down, Dan.
  
             Avocados, toothpicks. Coleus, root sprawl.
             The diffident glints of a late-day sun, rays
             splintered by leaves: they shake and, in their
             shaking, streak the light. Transparent murk
             of glasses at the glass.
  
      Would you move just one inch over? There. The light was in my eye.

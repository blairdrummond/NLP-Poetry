title : A Poem for Record Players

author : John Wieners

text : 
The scene changes
  
 Five hours later and
 I come into a room
 where a clock ticks.
 I find a pillow to 
 muffle the sounds I make.
 I am engaged in taking away
 from God his sound.
 The pigeons somewhere
 above me, the cough
 a man makes down the hall,
 the flap of wings
 below me, the squeak
 of sparrows in the alley.
 The scratches I itch
 on my scalp, the landing
 of birds under the bay
 window out my window.
 All dull details 
 I can only describe to you,
 but which are here and 
 I hear and shall never
 give up again, shall carry
 with me over the streets
 of this seacoast city,
 forever; oh clack your
 metal wings, god, you are
 mine now in the morning.
 I have you by the ears
 in the exhaust pipes of
 a thousand cars gunning
 their motors turning over
 all over town.

title : The Drought

author : Gary Soto

text : 
The clouds shouldered a path up the mountains 
East of Ocampo, and then descended,
Scraping their bellies gray on the cracked shingles of slate.

They entered the valley, and passed the roads that went 
Trackless, the houses blown open, their cellars creaking 
And lined with the bottles that held their breath for years.

They passed the fields where the trees dried thin as hat racks 
And the plow’s tooth bit the earth for what endured.
But what continued were the wind that plucked the birds spineless

And the young who left with a few seeds in each pocket, 
Their belts tightened on the fifth notch of hunger
Under the sky that deafened from listening for rain.

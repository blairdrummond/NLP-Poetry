Sonnet 144: Two loves I have of comfort and despair

Two loves I have of comfort and despair, 
Which like two spirits do suggest me still 
The better angel is a man right fair, 
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. 
To win me soon to hell, my female evil 
Tempteth my better angel from my side, 
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, 
Wooing his purity with her foul pride. 
And, whether that my angel be turn'd fiend, 
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell, 
But being both from me both to each friend, 
I guess one angel in another's hell. 
   Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt, 
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

When he movd into the house 
he wanted us to stomp & pray 
out the evil spirits 
       just in case they’d be there. 

How cld they 
when a medicine woman lived on the place 
& left it to the church when she went to happier 
grounds? 

But a truck hauling brush 
turnd on the road 
       & he jumped up screaming— 
deer prowler 
       at the antlered beast. 

We danced out the spirits 
he carried on the place. 
                How now pow wow 
he jumps in the sow-yard with the bow- 
                              wow cow. 

We passed the spirits to chickens 
to peck their legs— 
Eeeeevil spirits pock-marked 
       as the dartboard. 

W/ marbles shooting rabbit eyes 
we stompd wild fires he once built in his head, 
                still haunted him 
as though evil spirits could open 
a medicine woman’s door, 
       climb in her unpainted windows, 
crawl through yellowed wallpaper armoured w/ 
                              prayer-chants. 

We whooped & hawed until he sd nuf. 
       The house 
barricaded from deer prowlers 
                from under his headband.

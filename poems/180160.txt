The light here leaves you 
lonely, fading 

as does the dusk 
that takes too long 

to arrive. By morning 
the mountain moving   

a bit closer to the sun. 

This valley belongs 
to no one— 

except birds who name 
themselves by their songs 

in the dawn. 
What good 

are wishes, if they aren't 
used up 

The lamp of your arms. 

The brightest 
blue beneath the clouds— 

We guess 
at what's next 

unlike the mountain 

who knows it 
in the bones, a music   

too high 
to scale. 

*       *       * 

The burnt,   
blurred world 

where does it end— 

The wind 
kicks up the scent 

from the stables 
where horseshoes hold 

not just luck, but 
beyond. But 

weight. But a body 

that itself burns, 
begs to run. 

The gondola quits just 
past the clouds. 

The telephone poles   
tall crosses in the road. 

Let us go 
each, into the valley— 

turn ourselves   
& our hairshirts 

inside out, let the world 
itch—for once— 

*       *       * 

Black like an eye 

bruised night brightens 
by morning, yellow 

then grey— 
a memory. 

What the light was like. 

All day the heat a heavy, 
colored coat.   

I want to lie 
down like the lamb— 

down & down 
till gone— 

shorn of its wool. 
The cool 

of setting & rising 
in this valley, 

the canyon between us 
shoulders our echoes. 

Moan, & make way. 

*       *       * 

The sun's small fury 
feeds me. 

Wind dying down. 

We delay, & dither 
then are lifted 

into it, brightness 
all about— 

O setting. 
O the music 

as we soar 
is small, yet sating. 

What you want— 

Nobody, or nothing 
fills our short journeying. 

Above even the birds, 
winging heavenward, 

the world is hard 
to leave behind 

or land against— 
must end. 

I mean to make it. 

Turning slow beneath 
our feet,   

finding sun, seen 
from above, 

this world looks   
like us—mostly 

salt, dark water. 

*       *       * 

It's death there 
is no cure for 

life the long 
disease. 

If we're lucky. 

Otherwise, short 
trip beyond. 

And below. 

Noon,   
growing shadow. 

I chase the quiet 
round the house. 

Soon the sound— 

wind wills 
its way against 

the panes. Welcome 
the rain.   

Welcome 
the moon's squinting 

into space. 
The trees 

bow like priests. 

The storm lifts 
up the leaves. 

Why not sing.

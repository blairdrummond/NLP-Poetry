Sonnet

O what a strange parcel of creatures are we, 
Scarce ever to quarrel, or even agree; 
We all are alone, though at home altogether, 
Except to the fire constrained by the weather; 
Then one says, ''Tis cold', which we all of us know, 
And with unanimity answer, ''Tis so': 
With shrugs and with shivers all look at the fire, 
And shuffle ourselves and our chairs a bit nigher; 
Then quickly, preceded by silence profound, 
A yawn epidemical catches around: 
Like social companions we never fall out, 
Nor ever care what one another's about; 
To comfort each other is never our plan, 
For to please ourselves, truly, is more than we can.

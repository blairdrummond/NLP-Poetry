title : On Hearing Your News

author : Kate Buckley

text : 
My eyes lie flat in my skull,
 darkened, bruised
  
 lashes whip-stitched to swollen lids – 
 sleep has once again been elusive.
  
 My organs weigh more
 than they did the day before,
  
 swollen with unhappiness,
 gorged on regret:
  
 tiny fists in my stomach pummeling
 the hanging ball of my heart.

title : Turning Forty

author : Kevin Griffith

text : 
At times it's like there is a small planet 
inside me. And on this planet, 
there are many small wars, yet none 
big enough to make a real difference. 
The major countries—mind and heart—have 
called a truce for now. If this planet had a ruler, 
no one remembers him well. All 
decisions are made by committee. 
Yet there are a few pictures of the old dictator— 
how youthful he looked on his big horse, 
how bright his eyes. 
He was ready to conquer the world.

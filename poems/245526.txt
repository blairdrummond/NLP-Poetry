 There is no crumbly frozen cake to thaw.
 Today, we are in the jungle. I mean mosquito. I mean
  
 tigers and elephants sludging their way
 to the lake for a drink and Don’t make sudden moves
  
 or snakes startled from an afternoon nap
 will greet you fang first. I think we are lost. Too hot
  
 for any cold confection to survive. Even my tube
 of sunblock is as warm as a baby’s bottle. You get
  
 to those places I can’t reach, those places I dared
 not even whisper before I walked down the aisle
  
 in white. You never worried if our families
 would clash, if they would clang like the clutch
  
 of pale monkeys clanging the thin branches of the treetrops,
 begging for our trail mix. You never worried
  
 about my relatives staring at your pale, muscled calves—
 things not usually seen outside of the bedroom. You wore
  
 hiking shorts anyway. And still, they lavished ladle-fuls
 of food on your plate. I think we are lost. My eyes are dark
  
 and wet as that wild deer that walked right past us,
 a little off the trail. I think we are lost, but for once
  
 I don't mind. Eventually you turn us back to a place
 not on any map, but I know I can trace it back with my finger
  
 if we ever need it again. We made it one year
 without a compass and we’re not about to start now.

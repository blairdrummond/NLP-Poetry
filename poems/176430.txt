title : Fable for Blackboard

author : George Starbuck

text : 
Here is the grackle, people. 
Here is the fox, folks. 
The grackle sits in the bracken. The fox   
   hopes. 

Here are the fronds, friends, 
that cover the fox. 
The fronds get in a frenzy. The grackle   
   looks. 

Here are the ticks, tykes,   
that live in the leaves, loves.   
The fox is confounded, 
and God is above.

text : 
Grayscale breath on a fluid 
field, with lo-fi
                 rainpatter—petrol blue—, 
                                a 60-watt sun uns 
-crewed from the 
woebegone sky: rip-
                              ­rap & coal slurries, 
       dragline & loess, what phosphor 
-us is a semaphore 
for, silklike
                       in its acoustic shadows 
                             louver away, or stay 
when I move: 
figures astray from the mercury
                        dark—shatterproofless, 
                                   shutterproofless, 
image noise 
stressing each contour to
                                                    strass— 
                         as if the margins were 
swarming with 
centers, or cinders
                                           —"Ecchoes 
                                           to the Eye" — 
or Cinderella's slipper 
blown of poly­-
                                      vinyl butyral 
                             & laminated glass

This poem was found written on a paper bag by Richard Brautigan in a laundromat in San Francisco. The author is unknown.
By accident, you put 
Your money in my 
Machine (#4) 
By accident, I put 
My money in another 
Machine (#6) 
On purpose, I put 
Your clothes in the 
Empty machine full 
Of water and no   
Clothes 

It was lonely.

title : Rain on Tin

author : Rodney Jones

text : 
If I ever get over the bodies of women, I am going to think of the rain, 
of waiting under the eaves of an old house 
at that moment 
when it takes a form like fog. 
It makes the mountain vanish. 
Then the smell of rain, which is the smell of the earth a plow turns up, 
only condensed and refined. 
Almost fifty years since thunder rolled 
and the nerves woke like secret agents under the skin. 
Brazil is where I wanted to live. 
The border is not far from here. 
Lonely and grateful would be my way to end, 
and something for the pain please, 
a little purity to sand the rough edges, 
a slow downpour from the Dark Ages, 
a drizzle from the Pleistocene. 
As I dream of the rain’s long body, 
I will eliminate from mind all the qualities that rain deletes 
and then I will be primed to study rain’s power, 
the first drops lightly hallowing, 
but now and again a great gallop of the horse of rain 
or an explosion of orange-green light. 
A simple radiance, it requires no discipline. 
Before I knew women, I knew the lonely pleasures of rain. 
The mist and then the clearing. 
I will listen where the lightning thrills the rooster up a willow, 
and my whole life flowing 
until I have no choice, only the rain, 
and I step into it.

Such conundrums 
of English. I blame
my ex-wife. She 
rearranged my
dictionary, or re-
taught an old story:
in this book, 
if you look 
for alimony, 
it follows 
acrimony (nothing 
between). However,
contrition still
borders contrivance 
(if it can be seen). 
Untruth in her 
troth sallowed
the language, sullied 
a certain conjugation: 
how she lied 
as she lay with me.
Apparently her 
monogamy was too 
close to monotony. 

Alas, after parting
with that particular 
lass, I remain 
a student 
examining all 
our wordsâ€™
gradation:
how anniversary
now precedes
annihilation.

title : my dream about being white

author : Lucille Clifton

text : 
hey music and 
me 
only white, 
hair a flutter of 
fall leaves 
circling my perfect   
line of a nose, 
no lips, 
no behind, hey 
white me 
and i’m wearing 
white history 
but there’s no future   
in those clothes 
so i take them off and   
wake up 
dancing.

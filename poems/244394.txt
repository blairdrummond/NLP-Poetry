title : El Poema de lo Reverso

author : Victor Hernández Cruz

text : 
In which everything goes backwards
 in time and motion
 Palm trees shrink back into the ground
 Mangos become seeds
 and reappear in the eyes of Indian
 women
 The years go back
 cement becomes wood
 Panama hats are seen upon skeletons
 walking the plazas
 Of once again wooden benches
 The past starts to happen again
 I see Columbus’s three boats
 going backwards on the sea
 Getting smaller
 Crossing the Atlantic back to the
 ports of Spain    Cadiz    Dos Palos    Huelva
 Where the sailors disembark
 and go back to their towns
 To their homes
 They become adolescents again
 become children                infants
 they re-enter the wombs of their mothers
 till they become glances
 Clutching a pound of bread
 through a busy plaza
 that becomes the taste
 of the sound of church bells
 in reverberation.

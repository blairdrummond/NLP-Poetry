title : Sparrow Trapped in the Airport

author : Averill Curdy

text : 
Never the bark and abalone mask 
cracked by storms of a mastering god, 
never the godsâ€™ favored glamour, never 
the pelagic messenger bearing orchards 
in its beak, never allegory, not wisdom 
or valor or cunning, much less hunger 
demanding vigilance, industry, invention, 
or the instinct to claim some small rise 
above the plain and from there to assert 
the song of another day ending; 
lentil brown, uncounted, overlooked 
in the clamorous public of the flock 
so unlikely to be noticed here by arrivals, 
faces shining with oils of their many miles, 
where it hops and scratches below 
the baggage carousel and lights too high, 
too bright for any real illumination, 
looking more like a fumbled punch line 
than a stowaway whose revelation 
recalls how lightly we once traveled.

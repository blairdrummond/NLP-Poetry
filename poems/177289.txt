title : The animals in that country

author : Margaret Atwood

text : 
In that country the animals   
have the faces of people: 

the ceremonial 
cats possessing the streets 

the fox run 
politely to earth, the huntsmen   
standing around him, fixed   
in their tapestry of manners 

the bull, embroidered 
with blood and given 
an elegant death, trumpets, his name   
stamped on him, heraldic brand   
because 

(when he rolled 
on the sand, sword in his heart, the teeth   
in his blue mouth were human) 

he is really a man 

even the wolves, holding resonant   
conversations in their   
forests thickened with legend. 

            In this country the animals   
            have the faces of   
            animals. 

            Their eyes 
            flash once in car headlights   
            and are gone. 

            Their deaths are not elegant. 

            They have the faces of   
            no-one.

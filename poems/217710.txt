We are tender and our lives are sweet 

and they are already over and we are 
visiting them in some kind of endless 
reprieve from oblivion, we are walking 
around in them and after we shatter 
with love for everything we settle in. 

Thou tiger on television chowing, 
thou very fact of dreams, thou majestical 
roof fretted with golden fire. Thou wisdom 
of the inner parts. Thou tintinnabulation. 

Is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's 
harvest in a single wave of fish? To bounce 
a vineyard of grapes from one's apron 
and into the mouth of the crowd? To scoop up 
bread and offer up one's armful to the throng? 
Let us live as if we were still among 

the living, let our days be patterned after 
theirs. Is it not marvelous to be forgetful?

In memoriam Liam Rector
The little boy crying out 
Weenie Weenie 
in self-panicking delight, 
waving his little cock 
under the banner 

of the sun, seemed pure Blake, 
all anarchy and energy, 
an innocence unfrightened 
of itself that shook the lake's 
waters and unsettled 

the strained composures 
and appointed certainties 
of whatever Absolute Speaker 
had been ranting in my brain: 
Peace Through Strength 

Justice Must Be Ours— 
so many demon faces 
in the glass city. 
Each pubic triangle 
seemed, under the bathing suits, 

to grow electrical and crackle 
with a sexual shock 
that made me turn my face away: 
and who should be there 
but you, my dear Lord of Misrule, 

blowing smoke in all our faces, 
the clean bullet hole in your forehead 
above your self-ironic smile: 
Don't let the monkeys   
stop typing— 

and after I swam 
and I was sitting on the bank, 
after the boy and his parents 
had packed up and gone home, 
I played the Noh play over for you 

in the tape loop of the void 
where your voice and laughter 
so casually reside: 
how the mother 
gone searching for her 

missing son finds him dancing 
by the lake, and as she tries 
to   hold him he slips through 
her arms just as she slips   
through his arms— 

and as she cries out 
in perfect pitch in perfect time 
to the shrieking bamboo flute 
that her boy has drowned 
she understands that she too   

has drowned, that she too 
is a ghost returning   
to dance as they   
dance together in a tighter   
and tighter round.

Who did he talk to 

Did she trust what she saw 

Who does the talking 

Whose words formed awkward curves 

Did the lion finally talk 

Did the sleeping lion talk 

Did you trust a north window 

What made the dog bark 

What causes a grey dog to bark 

What does the juggler tell us 

What does the jugglerâ€™s redness tell us 

Is she standing in an image 

Were they lost in the forest 

Were they walking through a forest 

Has anything been forgotten 

Did you find it in the dark 

Is that one of them new atomic-powered wristwatches 

Was it called a talking song 

Is that an oblong poem 

Was poetry the object 

Was there once a road here ending at a door 

Thus from bridge to bridge we came along 

Did the machine seem to talk 

Did he read from an empty book 

Did the book grow empty in the dark, grey felt hat blowing down the 
street, arms pumping back and forth, legs slightly bowed 

Are there fewer ears than songs 

Did he trust a broken window 

Did he wake beneath a tree in the recent snow 

Whose words formed difficult curves 

Have the exaggerations quieted down 

The light is lovely on trees which are not large 

My logic is all in the melting-pot 

My life now is very economical 

I can say nothing of my feeling about space 

Nothing could be clearer than what you see on this wall 

Must we give each one a name 

Is it true they all have names 

Would it not have been simpler 

Would it not have been simpler to begin 

Were there ever such buildings 

I must remember to mention the trees 

I must remember to invent some trees 

Who told you these things 

Who taught you how to speak 

Who taught you not to speak 

Whose is the voice that empties

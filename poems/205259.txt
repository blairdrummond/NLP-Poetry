title : The Window

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
Position is where you   
put it, where it is, 
did you, for example, that 

large tank there, silvered,   
with the white church along- 
side, lift 

all that, to what   
purpose? How   
heavy the slow 

world is with   
everything put   
in place. Some 

man walks by, a   
car beside him on   
the dropped 

road, a leaf of   
yellow color is   
going to 

fall. It 
all drops into   
place. My 

face is heavy 
with the sight. I can   
feel my eye breaking.

author : Miroslav Holub

text : 
Children, when was 
Napoleon Bonaparte born, 
asks teacher. 

A thousand years ago, the children say. 
A hundred years ago, the children say. 
Last year, the children say. 
No one knows. 

Children, what did 
Napoleon Bonaparte do, 
asks teacher. 

Won a war, the children say. 
Lost a war, the children say. 
No one knows. 

Our butcher had a dog 
called Napoleon, 
says Frantisek. 
The butcher used to beat him and the dog died 
of hunger 
a year ago. 

And all the children are now sorry 
for Napoleon.

title : Letter of Recommendation

author : Robert B. Shaw

text : 
Miss A, who graduated six years back,
 has air-expressed me an imposing stack
 of forms in furtherance of her heart's desire:
 a Ph.D. Not wishing to deny her,
 I dredge around for something laudatory
 to say that won't be simply a tall story;
 in fact, I search for memories of her,
 and draw a blank—or say, at best a blur.
 Was hers the class in that ungodly room
 whose creaking door slammed with a sonic boom,
 whose radiators twangled for the first
 ten minutes, and then hissed, and (this was worst)
 subsided with a long, regretful sigh?
 Yes, there, as every Wednesday we would try
 to overlook cacophony and bring
 our wits to bear on some distinguished thing
 some poet sometime wrote, Miss A would sit
 calm in a middle row and ponder it.
 Blonde, I believe, and quiet (so many are).
 A dutiful note-taker. Not a star.
 Roundheads and Cavaliers received their due
 notice from her before the term was through.
 She wrote a paper on . . . could it have been
 "Milton's Idea of Original Sin"?
 Or was it "Deathbed Imagery in Donne"?
 Whichever, it was likely not much fun
 for her. It wasn't bad, though I've seen better.
 But I can hardly say that in a letter
 like this one, now refusing to take shape
 even as wispy memories escape
 the reach of certitude. Try as I may,
 I cannot render palpable Miss A,
 who, with five hundred classmates, left few traces
 when she decamped. Those mortarboard-crowned faces,
 multitudes, beaming, ardent to improve
 a world advancing dumbly in its groove,
 crossing the stage that day—to be consigned
 to a cold-storage portion of the mind . . .
 What could be sadder? (She remembered me.)
 The transcript says I gave Miss A a B.

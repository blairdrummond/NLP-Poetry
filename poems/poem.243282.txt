Rhymed Stanza

A blind man, on the thoroughfare,
 Startle-eyed as an owl by day,
 Piping a dismal little air,
 Taps here and there, loses his way,
  
 Tootles awry his time-old ditty
 Undauntedly, as by his side
 Lopes his dog, guides him through the city,
 Specter diurnal, sleepy-eyed.
  
 Days, stark, wash over him, unlit;
 He hears the dark world's constant din
 And all that life unseen, as it
 Rolls, rushing, like a flood walled in!
  
 God knows what black chimeras haunt
 That brain opaque, what lot befalls;
 And what dire spells the mind is wont
 To scribble on those death-vault walls!
  
 Like prisoner grown half-mad, who, pent,
 Rots beneath Venice in her jail
 Eternal, and whose hours are spent
 Scratching a message with a nail...
  
 But when the torch, in tomb immured,
 Dies in the breath of death, maybe
 The soul, to shades' gloom long inured,
 Will see with deathly clarity!

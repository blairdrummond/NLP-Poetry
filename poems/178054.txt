title : Sad Steps

author : Philip Larkin

text : 
Groping back to bed after a piss 
I part thick curtains, and am startled by   
The rapid clouds, the moon’s cleanliness. 

Four o’clock: wedge-shadowed gardens lie   
Under a cavernous, a wind-picked sky.   
There’s something laughable about this, 

The way the moon dashes through clouds that blow   
Loosely as cannon-smoke to stand apart   
(Stone-coloured light sharpening the roofs below) 

High and preposterous and separate—   
Lozenge of love! Medallion of art! 
O wolves of memory! Immensements! No, 

One shivers slightly, looking up there. 
The hardness and the brightness and the plain   
Far-reaching singleness of that wide stare 

Is a reminder of the strength and pain   
Of being young; that it can’t come again,   
But is for others undiminished somewhere.

text : 
for Baroness G. de Hueck
Across the cages of the keyless aviaries, 
The lines and wires, the gallows of the broken kites,   
Crucify, against the fearful light, 
The ragged dresses of the little children. 
Soon, in the sterile jungles of the waterpipes and ladders,   
The bleeding sun, a bird of prey, will terrify the poor,   
These will forget the unbelievable moon. 

But in the cells of whiter buildings, 
Where the glass dawn is brighter than the knives of surgeons,   
Paler than alcohol or ether, shinier than money, 
The white men’s wives, like Pilate’s, 
Cry in the peril of their frozen dreams: 

“Daylight has driven iron spikes, 
Into the flesh of Jesus’ hands and feet: 
Four flowers of blood have nailed Him to the walls of Harlem.” 

Along the white halls of the clinics and the hospitals   
Pilate evaporates with a cry: 
They have cut down two hundred Judases, 
Hanged by the neck in the opera houses and the museum. 

Across the cages of the keyless aviaries, 
The lines and wires, the gallows of the broken kites,   
Crucify, against the fearful light, 
The ragged dresses of the little children.

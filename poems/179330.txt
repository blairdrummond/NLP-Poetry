title : How Are You Doing?

author : Rick Snyder

text : 
As much as you deserve it, 
I wouldn’t wish this 
Sunday night on you— 
not the Osco at closing, 
not its two tired women 
and shaky security guard, 
not its bin of flip-flops 
and Tasmanian Devil 
baseball caps, 
not its freshly mopped floors 
and fluorescent lights, 
not its endless James Taylor 
song on the intercom, 
and not its last pint of 
chocolate mint ice cream, 
which I carried 
down Milwaukee Ave. 
past a man in an unbuttoned 
baseball shirt, who stepped 
out of a shadow to whisper, 
How are you doing?

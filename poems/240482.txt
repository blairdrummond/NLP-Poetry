title : A Ghost Abandons the Haunted

author : Katie Cappello

text : 
You ignore the way light filters through my cells, 
the way I have of fading out—still 
there is a constant tug, a stretching, 
what is left of me is coming loose. Soon,

I will be only crumbs of popcorn, 
a blue ring in the tub, an empty 
toilet paper roll, black mold 
misted on old sponges,

strands of hair woven into 
carpet, a warped door 
that won’t open, the soft spot 
in an avocado, celery, a pear,

a metallic taste in the beer, a cold sore 
on your lip—and when I finally lose my hold 
you will hear a rustle and watch me spill 
grains of rice across the cracked tile.

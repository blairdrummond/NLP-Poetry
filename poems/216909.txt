title : Planting the Meadow

author : Mary Makofske

text : 
I leave the formal garden of schedules 
where hours hedge me, clip the errant sprigs 
of thought, and day after day, a boxwood 
topiary hunt chases a green fox 
never caught. No voice calls me to order 
as I enter a dream of meadow, kneel 
to earth and, moving east to west, second 
the motion only of the sun. I plant 
frail seedlings in the unplowed field, trusting 
the wildness hidden in their hearts. Spring light 
sprawls across false indigo and hyssop, 
daisies, flax. Clouds form, dissolve, withhold 
or promise rain. In time, outside of time, 
the unkempt afternoons fill up with flowers.

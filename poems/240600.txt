title : Girl Riding a Horse in a Field of Sunflowers

author : David Allan Evans

text : 
Sitting perfectly upright, 
contented and pensive, 
she holds in one hand, 
loosely, the reins of summer:

the green of trees and bushes; 
the blue of lake water; 
the red of her jacket 
and open collar; the brown
of her pinned-up hair, 
and her horse, deep 
in the yellow of sunflowers.

When she stops to rest, 
summer rests. 
When she decides to leave, 
there goes summer
over the hill.

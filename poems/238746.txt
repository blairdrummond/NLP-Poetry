title : On Finding a Turtle Shell in Daniel Boone National Forest

author : Jeff Worley

text : 
This one got tired 
of lugging his fortress 
wherever he went, 
was done with duck and cover 
at every explosion 
through rustling leaves 
of fox and dog and skunk. 
Said au revoir to the ritual 
of pulling himself together. . .  
 
I imagine him waiting 
for the cover of darkness 
to let down his hinged drawbridge. 
He wanted, after so many 
protracted years of caution, 
to dance naked and nimble 
as a flame under the moon— 
even if dancing just once 
was all that the teeth 
of the forest would allow.

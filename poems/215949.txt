title : Overnight Guest

Waiting for your ride in front of the house 
where you spent the night,
where, as a third ear
during their endless intimate,
important, and kinky phone calls,
you pretended to rinse glassware;
you were a dog from the pound,
grateful, sniffing the upholstery.

Later, lying in the center of their 
king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall 
mirror, isolating you like a rabbit; 
it was also their exercise
room with torture equipment;
something in you twitched; 
flickering a bizarre video in your head.

It’s morning now. You’re standing
outside, with nightgown and toothbrush 
wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus
to take you somewhere else. You’re depressed. 
They’re asleep of course. Their network wrapped 
around them. You keep wondering why you’re 
missing something. Then you look back and see 
your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck 
inside their picture window, where for years
it will wave at you—naive, apologetic, embarrassed.

title : Long Story Short

author : G. E. Murray

text : 
One marriage, three children, the usual hero-to-hump tale   
of jobs in alternating altitudes, stories of unrequited joy.   
Fresh identities, dramas unseen. Too much of dawn 
going dark, making for a rich meal of dread, when contemplating   
love above the brim. 

You also should talk about dealings with heavy weather   
and one-night agonies, as if descending permanently   
into a single distinction. It boils to skin 
and plain whim, or any fabrication sufficient 
to implicate the act. 

Just then, something glimpsed from a taxi careening   
through Paris, afterimages of a lost father’s face   
becomes a tree in the park, tall, rustling with allusions,   
or was it simply cool air stealing across your face— 
that isolation again?

title : Mother, Washing Dishes

                                She rarely made us do it— 
we’d clear the table instead—so my sister and I teased 
that some day we’d train our children right 
and not end up like her, after every meal stuck 
with red knuckles, a bleached rag to wipe and wring. 
The one chore she spared us: gummy plates 
in water greasy and swirling with sloughed peas, 
globs of egg and gravy. 
 
                                Or did she guard her place 
at the window? Not wanting to give up the gloss 
of the magnolia, the school traffic humming. 
Sunset, finches at the feeder. First sightings 
of the mail truck at the curb, just after noon, 
delivering a note, a card, the least bit of news.

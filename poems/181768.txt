title : The Window, at the Moment of Flame

author : Alicia Ostriker

text : 
And all this while I have been playing with toys 
A toy power station a toy automobile a house of blocks 

And all this while far off in other lands 
Thousands and thousands, millions and millions— 

You know—you see the pictures 
Women carrying their bony infants 

Men sobbing over graves 
Buildings sculpted by explosion 

Earth wasted bare and rotten— 
And all this while I have been shopping, I have 

Been let us say free 
And do they hate me for it 

Do they hate me

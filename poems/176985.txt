title : First Poem for You

author : Kim Addonizio

text : 
I like to touch your tattoos in complete 
darkness, when I can’t see them. I’m sure of 
where they are, know by heart the neat 
lines of lightning pulsing just above 
your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue 
swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent 
twists, facing a dragon. When I pull you 

to me, taking you until we’re spent 
and quiet on the sheets, I love to kiss 
the pictures in your skin. They’ll last until 
you’re seared to ashes; whatever persists 
or turns to pain between us, they will still 
be there. Such permanence is terrifying. 
So I touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying.

title : In Tennessee I Found a Firefly

author : Mary Szybist

text : 
Flashing in the grass; the mouth of a spider clung   
          to the dark of it: the legs of the spider   
held the tucked wings close, 
          held the abdomen still in the midst of calling   
with thrusts of phosphorescent light— 

When I am tired of being human, I try to remember 
          the two stuck together like burrs. I try to place them   
central in my mind where everything else must 
          surround them, must see the burr and the barb of them.   
There is courtship, and there is hunger. I suppose 
          there are grips from which even angels cannot fly.   
Even imagined ones. Luciferin, luciferase. 
          When I am tired of only touching, 
I have my mouth to try to tell you 
          what, in your arms, is not erased.

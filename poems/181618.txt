title : The Apophatic

How can it not be 
about engine, 
secret blaze behind 
the wheels? How not about 
this no-way-to-resist seeing   
but one side or another   
since the rails quite insist 
& iron's so right, always 
running off its own might.   
How never about freightage 
or the outdoor face 
in the indoor light? 
A yesteryear's pall 
over the day at hand? Not 
about the passings-by 
of nailed-shut houses 
& grouse setting sail 
from a rusty swing?   
How not me out of uniform,   
out of a sleeper's berth, 
bare & barely rising   
atop smoke & so little air left 
in the soft underbelly   
that I may meet—nay, embrace— 
the hello-goodbye cloud.

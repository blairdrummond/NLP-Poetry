I met a man in South Street, tall-- 
a nervous shark tooth swung on his chain.   
His eyes pressed through green glass   
--green glasses, or bar lights made them   
so-- 
      shine-- 
                GREEN-- 
                           eyes-- 
stepped out--forgot to look at you 
or left you several blocks away-- 

in the nickel-in-the-slot piano jogged 
"Stamboul Nights"--weaving somebody's nickel--sang-- 

      O Stamboul Rose--dreams weave the rose! 

            Murmurs of Leviathan he spoke,   
            and rum was Plato in our heads . . . 

"It's S.S. Ala--Antwerp--now remember kid   
to put me out at three she sails on time.   
I'm not much good at time any more keep 
weakeyed watches sometimes snooze--" his bony hands   
got to beating time . . . "A whaler once-- 
I ought to keep time and get over it--I'm a   
Democrat--I know what time it is--No   
I don't want to know what time it is--that   
damned white Arctic killed my time . . . " 

      O Stamboul Rose--drums weave-- 

"I ran a donkey engine down there on the Canal   
in Panama--got tired of that-- 
then Yucatan selling kitchenware--beads-- 
have you seen Popocatepetl--birdless mouth   
with ashes sifting down--? 
                                          and then the coast again . . . " 

      Rose of Stamboul O coral Queen-- 
      teased remnants of the skeletons of cities-- 
      and galleries, galleries of watergutted lava   
      snarling stone--green--drums--drown--

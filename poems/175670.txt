title : The Trout

author : James Laughlin

text : 
A trout let us say 
a blue blonde trout 

that slips through   
the bars like water 

from boite to boite   
from man to man but 

only ones she likes   
and almost never for 

money and I love she   
says I love exagger- 

ate and her mother   
asked the neighbors 

qu’est-ce que j’ai   
fait au ciel pour 

avoir une fille qui   
est de l’ordure and 

she came back from   
the palaces of the 

king’s cousin out in   
Siam where they ate 

off gold plates and her   
whim was his com- 

mand came back to the   
bars and the boys and 

the slow swim through   
the dim light yes a 

trout let us call her   
a small blonde trout.

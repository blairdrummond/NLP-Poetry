Epigraph, Rhymed Stanza

Placare    ...    Christe    ...    servulis    ...    serviculis    ...    beatam me dicent orifice astral
He's really too cute to be a canker.
He's really too ugly to be a cantor.
(I won't allow you to write such a thing
You'll go to Hell for daring such a thing)
Misericordia animi anima anima mea
Ma mama mea maria la grosse ma    ...    Maria    ...    Oh! Give me a break    ...
There's someone bawling over the chatter.
There's someone splashing dishes with vomit splatter.
There's someone of the ones with a grainy voice.
If   you think I don't see you laughing at me, think again, you choir boys!
Resurrexit homini hominum Pelleas nostrum
And in the painting in back, the guys are sinister scum.
They've lit Catherine wheels for the Black Mass.
The angels in the painting in back have no place to sit, alas.
It's night, tick tock, too crass, plutocracy.
Our Lord swells, deflates: he wants to go out.
The last statue of   Mary -- the one to the left,
Connects, disconnects -- oh pardon me, pardon, is it a dream?
She dons a snout    ...    like the others,
Like all the others, in fact,
For there are no humans here.
Intumescitur anima mea, longitudinal,
Neither in the full scale of  the voices, the voice in the choir stalls,
Nor in my own voice in malaise, in malady, malalaia,
And all this for having brought a wolf or a hyena into the works.
 -- Oh! I saw it perfectly well! -- 
But God terribly takes revenge,
We eat God deliciously to make amends,
And the sacrilegious go to Hell.
What to do? That is
What's the meaning of soul, of the Mass, of the female ass
Except    ...    inept    ...    ept    ...

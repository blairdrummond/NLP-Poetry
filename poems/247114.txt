title : The Help I Need Is Not Available Here

author : Alli Warren

text : 
I need help with long term hope 
I need help with the dawn 
of war and achieving 
my new year's resolutions

This praise song 
and the problem of pornography 
structures this praise song 
as speaking placement

I need help moving my chickens
I need help with girl problem
my dog, like, keeps marking the wrong areas?

and my breasts
this most pressing issue
like choosing between best friends
a distance problem involving constant
acceleration and tethering glitches

The party's all "descendant selectors, please!" 
and me I'm in my handspring visor 
and my bird plucking problem

I need help with a bat script for parsing 
I need help with pricing with naming this 
praise song I said 
I seriously need help with the whole set up ASAP!

so it's
40.08 /100.09 (grams of molecular mass of calcium carbonate) =
moles of calcium

then
(moles of Calcium x .1973ml (convert grams to ml)) / 0.05

I got 1.580 ml 
is that right?

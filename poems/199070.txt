title : Crossroads

author : Mary Barnard

text : 
Rotting in the wet gray air 
the railroad depot stands deserted under   
still green trees. In the fields 
cold begins an end. 

There were other too-long-postponed departures.   
They left, finally, because of well water   
gone rank, the smell of fungus, the chill   
of rain in chimneys. 

The spot is abandoned even in memory. 
They knew, locking doors upon empty houses,   
to leave without regret is to lose 
title to one home forever.

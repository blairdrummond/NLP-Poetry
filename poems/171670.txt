title : Unholy Sonnet 11

author : Mark Jarman

text : 
Half asleep in prayer I said the right thing   
And felt a sudden pleasure come into   
The room or my own body. In the dark,   
Charged with a change of atmosphere, at first   
I couldn’t tell my body from the room.   
And I was wide awake, full of this feeling,   
Alert as though I’d heard a doorknob twist,   
A drawer pulled, and instead of terror knew   
The intrusion of an overwhelming joy.   
I had said thanks and this was the response.   
But how I said it or what I said it for   
I still cannot recall and I have tried   
All sorts of ways all hours of the night.   
Once was enough to be dissatisfied.

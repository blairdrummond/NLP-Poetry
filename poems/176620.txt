title : Taking Off My Clothes

author : Carolyn Forché

text : 
I take off my shirt, I show you. 
I shaved the hair out under my arms. 
I roll up my pants, I scraped off the hair   
on my legs with a knife, getting white. 

My hair is the color of chopped maples.   
My eyes dark as beans cooked in the south.   
(Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills) 

Skin polished as a Ming bowl 
showing its blood cracks, its age, I have hundreds   
of names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet. 

In the night I come to you and it seems a shame   
to waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man. 

You recognize strangers, 
think you lived through destruction. 
You can’t explain this night, my face, your memory. 

You want to know what I know?   
Your own hands are lying.

Beloved, men in thick green coats came crunching
 through the snow, the insignia on their shoulders
 of uncertain origin, a country I could not be sure of,
 a salute so terrifying I heard myself lying to avoid
 arrest, and was arrested along with Jocko, whose tear
 had snapped off, a tiny icicle he put in his mouth.
 We were taken to the ice prison, a palace encrusted
 with hoarfrost, its dome lit from within, Jocko admired
 the wiring, he kicked the walls to test the strength
 of his new boots.  A television stood in a block of ice,
 its blue image still moving like a liquid center.
 You asked for my innermost thoughts.  I wonder will I
 ever see a grape again?  When I think of the vineyard
 where we met in October—when you dropped a cluster
 custom insisted you be kissed by a stranger—how after
 the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms
 turned pink.  It seemed our future was sealed.  Everyone
 said so.  It is quiet here.  Not closing our ranks 
 weakens us hugely.  The snowflakes fall in a featureless
 bath.  I am the stranger who kissed you.  On sunny days
 each tree is a glittering chandelier.  The power of 
 mindless beauty!  Jocko told a joke and has been dead
 since May.  A bullethole in his forehead the officers
 call a third eye.  For a month I milked a barnful of
 cows.  It is a lot like cleansing a chandelier.  Wipe
 and polish, wipe and polish, round and round you go.
 I have lost my spectacles.  Is the book I was reading
 still open by the side of our bed?  Treat it as a bookmark
 saving my place in our story.

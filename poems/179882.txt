title : What Our Dead Do

author : Zbigniew Herbert

Jan came this morning 
—I dreamt of my father 
he says 

he was riding in an oak coffin 
I walked next to the hearse 
and father turned to me: 

you dressed me nicely 
and the funeral is very beautiful 
at this time of year so many flowers 
it must have cost a lot 

don’t worry about it father 
—I say—let people see 
we loved you 
that we spared nothing 

       six men in black livery 
       walk nicely at our sides 

father thought for a while 
and said—the key to the desk 
is in the silver inkwell 
there is still some money 
in the second drawer on the left 

with this money—I say— 
we will buy you a gravestone 
a large one of black marble 

it isn’t necessary—says father— 
better give it to the poor 

       six men in black livery 
       walk nicely at our sides 
       they carry burning lanterns 

again he seemed to be thinking 
—take care of the flowers in the garden 
cover them for the winter 
I don’t want them to be wasted 

you are the oldest—he says— 
from a little felt bag behind the painting 
take out the cuff links with real pearls 
let them bring you luck 
my mother gave them to me 
when I finished high school 
then he didn’t say anything 
he must have entered a deeper sleep 

this is how our dead 
look after us 
they warn us through dreams 
bring back lost money 
hunt for jobs 
whisper the numbers of lottery tickets 
 or when they can’t do this 
knock with their fingers on the windows 

and out of gratitude 
we imagine immortality for them 
snug as the burrow of a mouse

title : Mercury in Retrograde

author : Sheryl Luna

text : 
The day ended badly with a broken ankle,
 a jinxed printer, and a dead car. The dry yellow grass
 against the sunset saved me. Roosters
  
 pranced across a lawn of shit, proudly plumed
 in black feathers, bobbing before the gray goats.
 It was the first day I saw god in the quiet,
  
 and found a mustard seed was very small.
 There I had been for years cursing “why?”
 and all the gold in the sun fell upon me.
  
 There was a white mare in the midst
 of brown smog, majestic in the refinery
 clouds. Even the radio wouldn’t work!
  
 My mother limps and her hair falls out.
 The faithful drive white Chevy trucks
 or yellow Camrys, and I’m here golden
  
 on the smoking shock-less bus.
 I lost language in this want, each poem
 dust, Spanish fluttered
  
 as music across the desert, even weeds
 tumbled unloved. The police sirens seared
 the coming night, dogs howled helplessly
 sad.
  
 Lo I walk the valley of death, love
 lingers in my hard eyes. Mañana never 
 comes just right. I mend myself in the folds
  
 of paper songs, ring my paper bells
 for empty success. Quiero Nada,
 if I sing long enough, I’ll grow dreamlike
 and find a flock of pigeons, white under
 wings lifting awkward bodies like doves
 across the silky blue-white sky.

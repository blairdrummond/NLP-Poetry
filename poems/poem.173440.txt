Couplet, Rhymed Stanza

from Amphitryon
Fair Iris I love and hourly I die, 
But not for a lip nor a languishing eye: 
She's fickle and false, and there I agree; 
For I am as false and as fickle as she: 
We neither believe what either can say; 
And, neither believing, we neither betray. 

'Tis civil to swear and say things, of course; 
We mean not the taking for better or worse. 
When present we love, when absent agree; 
I think not of Iris, nor Iris of me: 
The legend of love no couple can find 
So easy to part, or so equally join'd.

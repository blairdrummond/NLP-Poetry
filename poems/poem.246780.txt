My song has put off her adornments.
 She has no pride of dress and decoration. 
 Ornaments would mar our union;
 they would come between thee and me; 
 their jingling would drown thy whispers.
  
 My poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight. 
 O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. 
 Only let me make my life simple and straight, 
 like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.

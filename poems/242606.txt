title : Wave Trough

author : Robert Fernandez

text : 
Sets the folds in alignment; 
this a shallow, a constitution of drops 
that moves to displace itself 
and unconsciously reverts 
to image. 

In such a state, 
the wave has become a settingâ€” 
a table across which cups 
with propositions rolled inside them 
are passed. 

The passage of cups does not limit 
the range of potential outcomes, 
and yet at no point does the wave 
dissolve into abstraction. 

The shades 
are drawn and we are 
overwhelmed by flags 
crossing the black divan. 

An axis of rotation, 
gliding a fraction of an inch 
and yet unveiling its total mass. 

Advancing, the disc of its body 
shimmers. Alighting on the sand, 
it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses. 

Dilated, it lifts from the sea floor: 
fine spokes radiating on a wheel. 
It passes between bands of bright 
water, a kiss or a plow.

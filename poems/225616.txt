title : More Than Enough

author : Marge Piercy

text : 
The first lily of June opens its red mouth. 
All over the sand road where we walk 
multiflora rose climbs trees cascading 
white or pink blossoms, simple, intense 
the scene drifting like colored mist. 

The arrowhead is spreading its creamy 
clumps of flower and the blackberries 
are blooming in the thickets. Season of 
joy for the bee. The green will never 
again be so green, so purely and lushly 

new, grass lifting its wheaty seedheads 
into the wind. Rich fresh wine 
of June, we stagger into you smeared 
with pollen, overcome as the turtle 
laying her eggs in roadside sand.

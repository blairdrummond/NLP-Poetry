It is always the dispossessed— 
someone driving a huge rusted Dodge   
that’s burning oil, and must cost   
twenty-five dollars to fill. 

Today before seven I saw, through 
the morning fog, his car leave the road,   
turning into the field. It must be 
his day off, I thought, or he’s out 
of work and drinking, or getting stoned.   
Or maybe as much as anything 
he wanted to see 
where the lane through the hay goes. 

It goes to the bluff overlooking   
the lake, where we’ve cleared   
brush, swept the slippery oak 
leaves from the path, and tried to destroy   
the poison ivy that runs 
over the scrubby, sandy knolls. 

Sometimes in the evening I’ll hear   
gunshots or firecrackers. Later a car   
needing a new muffler backs out 
to the road, headlights withdrawing   
from the lowest branches of the pines. 

Next day I find beer cans, crushed;   
sometimes a few fish too small   
to bother cleaning and left 
on the moss to die; or the leaking   
latex trace of outdoor love.... 
Once I found the canvas sling chairs   
broken up and burned. 

Whoever laid the fire gathered stones   
to contain it, like a boy pursuing 
a merit badge, who has a dream of work,   
and proper reward for work.

text : 
Every day a wilderness—no   
shade in sight. Beulah 
patient among knicknacks,   
the solarium a rage 
of light, a grainstorm 
as her gray cloth brings 
dark wood to life. 

Under her hand scrolls 
and crests gleam 
darker still. What 
was his name, that 
silly boy at the fair with 
the rifle booth? And his kiss and   
the clear bowl with one bright   
fish, rippling 
wound! 

Not Michael— 
something finer. Each dust   
stroke a deep breath and   
the canary in bloom. 
Wavery memory: home   
from a dance, the front door   
blown open and the parlor   
in snow, she rushed 
the bowl to the stove, watched   
as the locket of ice 
dissolved and he 
swam free. 

That was years before 
Father gave her up 
with her name, years before   
her name grew to mean   
Promise, then   
Desert-in-Peace. 
Long before the shadow and   
sun’s accomplice, the tree. 

Maurice.

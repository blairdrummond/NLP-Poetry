title : The Beggars

author : Rainer Maria Rilke

text : 
You didn't know 
what was in the heap. A visitor found 
it to contain beggars. They sell the hollow 
of their hands. 

They show the sightseer 
their mouths full of filth, 
and let him (he can afford it) peer 
at the mange eating away at them. 

In their twisted vision 
his stranger's face is skewed; 
they are pleased with their accession, 
and when he speaks they spew.

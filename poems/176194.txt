When you swim in the surf off Seal Rocks, and your family 
Sits in the sand 
Eating potato salad, and the undertow   
Comes which takes you out away down 
To loss of breath loss of play and the power of play 
Holler, say 
Help, help, help. Hello, they will say,   
Come back here for some potato salad. 

It is then that a seventeen-year-old cub   
Cruising in a helicopter from Antigua, 
A jackstraw expert speaking only Swedish   
And remote from this area as a camel, says   
Look down there, there is somebody drowning. 
And it is you. You say, yes, yes,   
And he throws you a line. 
This is what is called the brotherhood of man.

text : 
Less the shadow 
than you a stag, sudden, through it.   
Less the stag breaking cover than 

the antlers, with which   
crowned. 
Less the antlers as trees leafless, 

to either side of the stag’s head, than— 
between them—the vision that must   
mean, surely, rescue. 

Less the rescue. 
More, always, the ache   
toward it. 

When I think of death, the gleam of 
the world darkening, dark, gathering me   
now in, it is lately 

as one more of many other nights   
figured with the inevitably   
black car, again the stranger’s 

strange room entered not for prayer   
but for striking 
prayer’s attitude, the body 

kneeling, bending, until it finds   
the muscled patterns that   
predictably, given strain and 

release, flesh assumes.   
When I think of desire, 
it is in the same way that I do 

God: as parable, any steep 
and blue water, things that are always   
there, they only wait 

to be sounded. 
And I a stone that, a little bit, perhaps   
should ask pardon. 

My fears—when I have fears— 
are of how long I shall be, falling,   
and in my at last resting how 

indistinguishable, inasmuch as they   
are countless, sire, 
all the unglittering other dropped stones.

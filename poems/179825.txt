title : How Smokes the Smolder

author : Todd Boss

text : 
at neck, at   
shoulder, that 

stokes a man 
as he grows 

older. Nothing 
rages, nothing 

fumes. No one 
races through 

the rooms,   
alarmed. How 

casually he's 
armed. How   

gradually arises   
what surprises   

in his mirrors. 
Unawares, as 

fall runs colder, 
pulls he only 

slightly tighter 
his good wool   

sweater, thinner   
than ever now 

at elbow,   
at shoulder.

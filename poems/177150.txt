text : 
Not your ordinary ice cream, though the glaze   
of these skeletal figures affects 
the disposition of those grinning candies 
one finds in Mexico, say, at the start of November,   
though here, each face is troublingly familiar,   
exhibits the style adopted just as one declines   
any further style—nectar one sips just as he   
draws his last, dispassionate breath, becomes   
citizen of a less earnest electorate. One learns   
in that city finally how to enjoy a confection,   
even if a genuine taste for this circumstance   
has yet to be acquired, even if it is oneself   
whose sugars and oils now avail a composure   
which promises never to end, nor to alter.

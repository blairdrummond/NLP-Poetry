title : A Sum of Destructions

author : Theodore Weiss

text : 
The amities of morning 
and the buxom habits of birds   
that swing a bell-bright city   
in their intelligent wings; 

last night’s squall has 
drawn off like anger’s tide, 
the remote and muffled waters   
beating solitudinous rocks 

and murmurous 
in the hidden parts, ebbing   
and beating, of the mind 
as some half-forgotten name . . . 

the rain has withdrawn 
like the tents and the Greeks,   
like the hard-to-believe- 
in days of our childhood. 

Light moves, the whole 
massed flotilla of morning, kin   
to the upward flight of birds   
returning; 
                and brutality, 
the hungers and the hatreds   
seem fabulous, seem members;   
the gouty rat and straggly 

root collaborate. Earth 
in wounds, deaths, decays— 
past hours its rutted crusts— 
with the billowy sky 

is the field- 
upon-field, and all one,   
of one master observing   
the various fruits: 
                              somewhere 
a child in a cage, inferior   
bodies making a passable   
road, a girl passionate 

with pain, an old man   
watching the earth escape   
like his once endless 
strengths, his poems head- 

long. And one fills 
with awe—as the town 
with morning, every cranny,   
the birds brimming fire- 

escapes and broken windows— 
that the earth like some wise   
breath never balked, a many- 
membered bird-flight, 

should include all, 
must be a terrible good.   
The eyes passing, 
contracted from night 

and war the stars 
undertook, finally emerge   
the topgallant of morning,   
and those eyes roam 

free as the Greeks: 
wherever a drop of water   
is, spindrift city of water   
gleaming, there is home.

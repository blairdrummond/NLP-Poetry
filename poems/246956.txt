title : In Memory of the Rock Band Breaking Circus

author : Stephen Burt

text : 
You were whiny and socially unacceptable even 
to loud young men whose first criterion 
for rock and roll was that it strike someone else 
as awful and repulsive and you told 
grim stories about such obscure affairs 
as a man-killing Zamboni and a grudge-
laden marathon runner from Zanzibar

who knifed a man after finishing sixteenth

Each tale sped from you at such anxious rate
sarcastic showtunes abject similes
feel like a piece of burnt black toast
for example threaded on a rusty wire followed
up by spitting too much time to think
by fusillades from rivetguns by cold
and awkward bronze reverberant church bells

percussive monotones 4/4 all for

the five or six consumers who enjoyed
both the impatience of youth
and the pissiness of middle age
as if you knew you had to get across
your warnings against all our lives as fast
as practicable before roommate or friend
could get up from a couch to turn them off

We barely remember you in Minnesota we love

our affable Replacements who modeled a more
acceptable form of rage who thought of girls
and cities boys and beds and homes and cars
as flawed but fixable with the right drink 
right mates and right guitar strings whereas you 
did not and nothing in your songs resolved 
except in a certain technical sense as a drill

resolves contests between drywall and screw

Your second bassist took the stage name Flour 
your second drummer copied a machine 
Somebody else in your hometown took credit 
for every sound you taught them how to use 
I write about you now since nobody else 
is likely to and since even appalled 
too-serious flat compliments like these

are better than nothing and because to annoy

perseverate and get under everyone's skin
beats the hell out of the real worst thing in the world
which is to fade into silence entirely which
will never happen to The Ice Machine
to "Driving the Dynamite Truck" to The Very Long Fuse
to Smoker's Paradise such hard sticks thrown
in the eyes of any audience that is

I should say not until it happens to me

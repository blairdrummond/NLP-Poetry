Mingled with the ordinary blueness would be waves of 
foreheads shaped like cups.

Dear Apollinaire: We drove 500 miles to attend the 
wedding of a relative. Our son was to be in the 
bridal party. The wedding was to take place at 4 p.m. 
on Saturday. On the Friday night before the wedding, 
the bride and groom got into a fight and the groom 
broke the bride’s nose so the wedding was canceled. 
          What do we do with the wedding gift we were 
going to take to the church? Who pays for the 
tuxedo our son rented for the occasion and never got 
to wear? And how about the motel bill?

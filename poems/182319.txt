title : Notes on Poverty

author : Hayden Carruth

text : 
Was I so poor 
      in those damned days 
that I went in the dark 
      in torn shoes 
and furtiveness 
      to steal fat ears 
of cattle corn 
      from the good cows 
and pound them 
      like hard maize 
on my worn Aztec 
      stone? I was.

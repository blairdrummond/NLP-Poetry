title : What the Ventriloquists Said

text : 
amid the growing craze for automatons
 The voice within the device that moves      is not
                                                               (as if nothing human
 could be quite that moving) My precious edgling: though
                                                                                           some
                                                                                           believe
 the answers be given by a man concealed,
                                         these are speaking machines.
  
                                         They were risking their lives.
 Usually a woman or a child, who woke up inside the oracle,
 who swallowed the burning oil, and who forces the idols to speak?
  
                                         Though when the bishop Theophilus
 broke open the statues at Alexandria, he found them hollow
  
                                         it does not necessarily follow that
  
 The penalty for trickery was death.
                                         Such is the wealth of belief.
                                         Behind a finely painted sheet of shell
 a voice unlatched surrounds the world.

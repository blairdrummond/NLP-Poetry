title : Red Parade

text : 
Depressed because my 
book wasn’t nominated 
for a gay award, 

I lie on my couch 
watching—not listening to— 
the O.J. trial. 

Byron, who senses 
something’s wrong, hides under the 
bed until Ira 

comes home, carrying 
a bouquet of beautifully 
wrapped tulips. I press 

the mute button. “This 
is your prize,” he says. “Guess what 
they’re called.” A smile in- 

voluntarily 
overcomes my frown. “What?” “Red 
Parade.” “That sounds like 

the name of an old 
Barbie outfit,” I say. “That’s 
exactly what I 

told the florist. And 
you know what she told me?” “What?” 
“When she was a girl, 

she turned her Barbie 
into Cleopatra: gave 
her an Egyptian 

haircut and painted 
her nipples blue.” “How cool.” “Yeah, 
but now she thinks that 

her doll would be worth 
eight hundred dollars if she 
hadn’t messed it up.” 

Once in water, the 
tulips begin to unclench— 
ten angry fists. Their 

colors are fierce, like 
Plath’s “great African cat,” her 
“bowl of red blooms.” Poor 

Sylvia, who so 
desperately wanted awards, 
and only won them 

after she was dead. 
Byron jumps up, Ira sits 
down and massages 

my feet. “You guys.” My 
spirits are lifted by their 
tulips, kisses, licks.

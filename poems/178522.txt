Washington, D.C. 
At least it helps me to think about my son   
a Leo/born to us   
(Aries and Cancer) some   
sixteen years ago   
in St. John’s Hospital next to the Long Island   
Railroad tracks   
Atlantic Avenue/Brooklyn   
New York   

at dawn 

which facts   
do not really prepare you   
(do they)   

for him 

angry   
serious   
and running through the darkness with his own   

becoming light

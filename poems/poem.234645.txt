Rhymed Stanza

Go, smiling souls, your new-built cages break, 
In heaven you'll learn to sing, ere here to speak, 
Nor let the milky fonts that bathe your thirst 
                                           Be your delay; 
The place that calls you hence is, at the worst, 
                                           Milk all the way.

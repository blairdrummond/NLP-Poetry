Mine -
the Right of the White Election! (411)
1830-1886

U.S., New, England

Poems for Weddings



Mine - by the Right of the White Election!
Mine - by the Royal Seal!
Mine - by the sign in the Scarlet prison - 
Bars - cannot conceal!

Mine - here - in Vision - and in Veto!
Mine - by the Grave's Repeal - 
Titled - Confirmed - 
Delirious Charter! 
Mine - long as Ages steal!

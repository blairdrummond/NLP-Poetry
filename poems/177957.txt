Small wonder 
he’s not been sighted all winter;   
this old brock’s 
been to Normandy and back 

through the tunnels and trenches   
of his subconscious. 
His father fell victim 
to mustard-gas at the Somme; 

one of his sons lost a paw   
to a gin-trap at Lisbellaw: 
another drills 
on the Antrim hills’ 

still-molten lava 
in a moth-eaten Balaclava. 
An elaborate 
system of foxholes and duckboards 

leads to the terminal moraine   
of an ex-linen baron’s 
croquet-lawn 
where he’s part-time groundsman. 

I would find it somewhat infra dig  
to dismiss him simply as a pig   
or heed Gerald of Wales’ 
tall tales 

of badgers keeping badger-slaves.   
For when he shuffles 
across the esker 
I glimpse my grandfather’s whiskers 

stained with tobacco-pollen. 
When he piddles against a bullaun   
I know he carries bovine TB 
but what I see 

is my father in his Sunday suit’s   
bespoke lime and lignite, 
patrolling his now-diminished estate   
and taking stock of this and that.

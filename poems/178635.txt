title : The Hand That Signed the Paper

author : Dylan Thomas

text : 
The hand that signed the paper felled a city;   
Five sovereign fingers taxed the breath,   
Doubled the globe of dead and halved a country;   
These five kings did a king to death. 

The mighty hand leads to a sloping shoulder,   
The finger joints are cramped with chalk;   
A goose’s quill has put an end to murder   
That put an end to talk. 

The hand that signed the treaty bred a fever,   
And famine grew, and locusts came; 
Great is the hand that holds dominion over   
Man by a scribbled name. 

The five kings count the dead but do not soften   
The crusted wound nor stroke the brow;   
A hand rules pity as a hand rules heaven;   
Hands have no tears to flow.

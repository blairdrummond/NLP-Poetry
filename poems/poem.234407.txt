Free Verse

I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea, 
His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, 
I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes, 
I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks. 

What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves? 
Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle-age? 

Steady and long he struggles, 
He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength holds out, 
The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, turn him, 
His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis'd on rocks, 
Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.

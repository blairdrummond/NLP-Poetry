title : The Triumph of Death

author : Rosanna Warren

To Mary Sidney

In your lace ruff you resemble a giant
               snowflake or a spider web
 pearled with dew. What poets you catch
  
 in your symmetries, at your long table at Wilton
               what wits (Spenser, Fulke-
 Greville, Drayton) pitch into the roasted
  
 piglet, stewed apples, carp.
               If you rowzed God up, He
 knocked you back on your heels, Lady—
  
 “O God, why hast thou thus
               Repulst, and scattred us?”—Through the high
 windows at Wilton seethe
  
 rumors of battle, Philip’s pussing thigh,
               death in the Lowlands. Mother Wrong,
 Daughter Strife stalk the cities; still
  
 you keep house with grammar, you salt the psalms
               for long preserving. “As smoke in wind,
 as wax at fire doth waste”
  
 the unjust dissolve. Your stanzas
               stay, still sting the tongue.
 Dawn finds you kneeling on stone, calling
  
 again the bleak God you believe
               will answer you.
 You mix medicines, you write
  
 in invisible ink. But Time
               trumps Fame which undoes Death
 which masters Chastity and Love—which leaves
  
 Eternity, your Master wrote, master of all.
               And like your lace, your lines
 shine, not pale, “but whitely,
  
 and more whitely pure
               than snow on windless hill that flaking falls,
 as one whom labour did to rest allure.”
  
 Translate us too, rough line by line,
               into your crystalline
 severe design.

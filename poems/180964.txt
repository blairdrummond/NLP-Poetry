title : What He Thought

We were supposed to do a job in Italy 
and, full of our feeling for 
ourselves (our sense of being 
Poets from America) we went 
from Rome to Fano, met 
the mayor, mulled 
a couple matters over (what's 
a cheap date, they asked us; what's 
flat drink). Among Italian literati 

we could recognize our counterparts: 
the academic, the apologist, 
the arrogant, the amorous, 
the brazen and the glib—and there was one 

administrator (the conservative), in suit 
of regulation gray, who like a good tour guide 
with measured pace and uninflected tone narrated 
sights and histories the hired van hauled us past. 
Of all, he was the most politic and least poetic, 
so it seemed. Our last few days in Rome 
(when all but three of the New World Bards had flown) 
I found a book of poems this 
unprepossessing one had written: it was there 
in the pensione room (a room he'd recommended) 
where it must have been abandoned by 
the German visitor (was there a bus of them?) 
to whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before. 
I couldn't read Italian, either, so I put the book 
back into the wardrobe's dark. We last Americans 

were due to leave tomorrow. For our parting evening then 
our host chose something in a family restaurant, and there 
we sat and chatted, sat and chewed, 
till, sensible it was our last 
big chance to be poetic, make 
our mark, one of us asked 
                                             "What's poetry?" 
Is it the fruits and vegetables and 
marketplace of Campo dei Fiori, or 
the statue there?" Because I was 

the glib one, I identified the answer 
instantly, I didn't have to think—"The truth 
is both, it's both," I blurted out. But that 
was easy. That was easiest to say. What followed 
taught me something about difficulty, 
for our underestimated host spoke out, 
all of a sudden, with a rising passion, and he said: 

The statue represents Giordano Bruno, 
brought to be burned in the public square 
because of his offense against 
authority, which is to say 
the Church. His crime was his belief 
the universe does not revolve around 
the human being: God is no 
fixed point or central government, but rather is 
poured in waves through all things. All things 
move. "If God is not the soul itself, He is 
the soul of the soul of the world." Such was 
his heresy. The day they brought him 
forth to die, they feared he might 
incite the crowd (the man was famous 
for his eloquence). And so his captors 
placed upon his face 
an iron mask, in which 

he could not speak. That's 
how they burned him. That is how 
he died: without a word, in front 
of everyone. 
                     And poetry— 
                                        (we'd all 
put down our forks by now, to listen to 
the man in gray; he went on 
softly)— 
                  poetry is what 

he thought, but did not say.

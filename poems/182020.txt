title : The Way

author : Rae Armantrout

text : 
Card in pew pocket 
announces, 
“I am here.” 

I made only one statement 
because of a bad winter. 

Grease is the word; grease 
is the way 

I am feeling. 
Real life emergencies or 

flubbing behind the scenes. 

As a child,   
I was abandoned 

in a story 
made of trees. 

Here’s the small 
gasp 

of this clearing 
come “upon” “again”

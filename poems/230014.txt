For Ana Menendez
It only takes one night with the wind on its knees 
to imagine Carl Sandburg unfolding 
a map of Chicago, puzzled, then walking the wrong way. 

The lines on his face are hard to read. I alternate 
between the tv, where a plastic surgeon is claiming 
that every facial expression causes wrinkles, and 

the newspaper. I picture the surgeon reading the lines 
on Sandburg’s face, lines that would’ve made more sense 
if the poet had been, say, a tree growing 

in a wind orchard. Maybe he simply smiled too much. 
I’m reading about the All-Star game, thinking 
that maybe Sandburg saw the White Sox of 1919. 

. . .

I love American newspapers, the way each section 
is folded independently and believes it owns 
the world. There’s this brief item in the inter- 

national pages: the Chinese government has posted 
signs in Tiananmen Square, forbidding laughter. 
I’m sure the plastic surgeon would approve, he’d say 

the Chinese will look young much longer, their faces 
unnaturally smooth, but what I see (although 
no photograph accompanies the story) is laughter 

bursting inside them. I go back to the sports section 
and a closeup of a rookie in mid-swing, his face 
keeping all the wrong emotions in check. 

. . .

When I read I bite my lower lip, a habit 
the plastic surgeon would probably call 
cosmetic heresy because it accelerates the aging 

process. I think of Carl Sandburg and the White Sox; 
I think of wind in Tiananmen Square, how a country 
deprived of laughter ages invisibly; I think 

of the Great Walls of North America, each of them 
a grip on some outfield like a rookie’s hands 
around a bat when the wind is against him; I bite 

my lower lip again; I want to learn 
to think in American, to believe that a headline 
is a fact and all stories are suspect.

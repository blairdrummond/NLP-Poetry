title : She Considers the Dimensions of Her Soul

author : She Considers the Dimensions of Her Soul Young Smith

text : 
The shape of her soul is a square. 
She knows this to be the case 
because she often feels its corners 
pressing sharp against the bone 
just under her shoulder blades 
and across the wings of her hips. 
At one time, when she was younger, 
she had hoped that it might be a cube, 
but the years have worked to dispel 
this illusion of space, so that now 
she understands: it is a simple plane, 
a shape with surface, but no volume— 
a window without a building, an eye 
without a mind. 
                        Of course, this square 
does not appear on x-rays, and often, 
weeks may pass when she forgets 
that it exists. When she does think 
to consider its purpose in her life, 
she can say only that it aches with 
a single mystery, for whose answer 
she has long ago given up the search— 
since its question is a word whose name 
can never quite be asked. This yearning, 
she has concluded, is the only function 
of the square, repeated again and again 
in each of its four matching angles, 
until, with time, she is persuaded 
anew that what it frames has no 
interest in ever making her happy.

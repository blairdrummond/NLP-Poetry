title : The Chaste Stranger

All the sexually active people in Westport 
look so clean and certain, I wonder 
if they’re dead. Their lives are tennis 
without end, the avocado-green Mercedes 
waiting calm as you please. Perhaps it is 
my brain that is unplugged, and these 
shadow-people don’t know how to drink 
martinis anymore. They are suddenly and 
mysteriously not in the least interested 
in fornicating with strangers. Well, 
there are a lot of unanswered questions 
here, and certainly no dinner invitations 
where a fella could probe Buffy‘s inner-
mush, a really complicated adventure, 
in a 1930ish train station, outlandish 
bouquets, a poisonous insect found 
burrowing its way through the walls 
of the special restaurant and into one 
of her perfect nostrilsshe was reading 
Meetings with Remarkable Men, needing 
succor, dreaming of a village near Bosnia, 
when a clattering of carts broke her thoughts
“Those billy goats and piglets, they are 
all so ephemeral ...” But now, in Westport 
Connecticut, a boy, a young man really, 
looking as if he had just come through 
a carwash, and dressed for the kind of success 
that made her girlfriends froth and lather, 
can be overheard speaking to no one 
in particular: “That Paris Review crowd, 
I couldn’t tell if they were bright 
or just overbred.” Whereupon Buffy swings 
into action, pinning him to the floor: 
“I will unglue your very being from this
planet, if ever ...” He could appreciate
her sincerity, not to mention her spiffy togs. 
Didymus the Blind has put three dollars
on Total Departure, and I am tired of pumping 
my own gas. I’m Lewis your aluminum man, 
and we are whirling in a spangled frenzy toward 
a riddle and a doomhere’s looking up

your old address.

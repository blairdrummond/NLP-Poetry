I wore a large brim hat 
like the women in the ads. 
How thin I was: such skin. 
Yes. It was Indianapolis; 
a taste of sin.

You had a natural Afro; 
no money for a haircut. 
We were in the seedy part; 
the buildings all run-down; 
the record shop, the jazz 
impeccable. We moved like
the blind, relying on our touch. 
At the corner coffee shop, 
after an hour’s play, with our 
serious game on paper, 
the waitress asked us
to move on. It wasn’t much.

Oh mortal love, your bones
were beautiful. I traced them 
with my fingers. Now the light 
grows less. You were so angular. 
The air darkens with steel
and smoke. The cracked world 
about to disintegrate,
in the arms of my total happiness.

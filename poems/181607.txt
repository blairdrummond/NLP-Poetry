title : Anything But the Case

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
Do me my elegy now, or I'll scrawl the thing 
I scrawl as you're going or screw in a ball when you're gone, 
Or you and I write unaware in each other's tongue 
That you or I ever set foot . . . Or do what our son 
And/or little daughter got done: got our brilliant names 
Pricily grooved in marble by one skilled 
In times of loss; dream iridescent dreams 
It's that first Saturday. Let this hour be filled 
With anything but the case, so that Time the clerk 
Goes panting in horror from gremlin to error to glitch 
And his screen is stripes and he knows he saved his work 
In one of a billion files but fuck knows which, 
And he lets us alone or, at worst, as we tiptoe by, 
Feels we're familiar, can't for the world say why.

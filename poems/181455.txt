title : Against Naturism

author : Roddy Lumsden

text : 
I realise it’s not all salad sandwiches 
at pinewood picnics, endless volleyball. 
I’ve heard the argument that talk of shame 
and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty; 
how we've all got one. Seen one, seen ’em all. 

But it’s not for me, beneath my double load 
of Calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies. 
For me, I have to see the clothes come off: 
the way a button’s thumbed through cotton cloth - 
a winning move in some exotic game 

with no set rules but countless permutations - 
or how a summer dress falls to the floor 
with momentary mass and with a plash 
that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion; 
a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip, 

three fingertips that follow down the spine 
to where a clasp is neatly spun undone 
amidkiss, by prime legerdemain 
and who cares that it happens once in four 
and never, never on the first undressing, 

it must be better than a foreskin snagged 
on gorse thorns or a cold, fat nipple jammed 
in the scissor drawer, the bounty and the blessing, 
the mystery of nakedness reduced 
till on a par with go-go palaces 

where goosebumped, grinding strippers strut their stuff 
in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses, 
down on a par with the oncologist 
who gropes for lumps, the night-morgue man who clips 
his nails amongst the naked, bin-bagged stiffs. 

So, stranger, what I want to say is this: 
if you’re to join me in a little sinning 
(and this is my place up here on the right), 
please understand I’d value some reluctance, 
a cold-feet shiver, as in the beginning 

when Eve discovered modesty and slipped 
in and out of something comfortable. 
For there are many ways to skin a cat, 
but ours is human nature - things come off 
so rarely. Come in. Let me take your coat.

title : Some Boys are Born to Wander

author : Walter McDonald

From Michigan our son writes, How many elk? 
How many big horn sheep? It's spring, 
and soon they'll be gone above timberline, 

climbing to tundra by summer. Some boys 
are born to wander, my wife says, but rocky slopes 
with spruce and Douglas fir are home. 

He tried the navy, the marines, but even the army 
wouldn't take him, not with a foot like that. 
Maybe it's in the genes. I think of wild-eyed years 

till I was twenty, and cringe. I loved motorcycles, 
too dumb to say no to our sonâ€”too many switchbacks 
in mountains, too many icy spots in spring. 

Doctors stitched back his scalp, hoisted him in traction 
like a twisted frame. I sold the motorbike to a junkyard, 
but half his foot was gone. Last month, he cashed 

his paycheck at the Harley house, roared off 
with nothing but a backpack, waving his headband, 
leaning into a downhill curve and gone.

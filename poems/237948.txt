title : For Ben Webster

author : Reuben Jackson

text : 
where do his eyes go 
when he plays ballads?

higher than smoke 
fogging the room,

cymbals which rustle god’s earlobes 
like kisses.

a friend swears there is a 
skylight in his hat 
where notes gather 
before plunging toward the bell 
of his tenor,

while ben gazes longingly 
up the skirts of stars.

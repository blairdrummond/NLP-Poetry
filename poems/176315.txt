title : Catch a Little Rhyme

author : Eve Merriam

text : 
Once upon a time 
I caught a little rhyme 

I set it on the floor 
but it ran right out the door 

I chased it on my bicycle 
but it melted to an icicle 

I scooped it up in my hat 
but it turned into a cat 

I caught it by the tail 
but it stretched into a whale 

I followed it in a boat 
but it changed into a goat 

When I fed it tin and paper 
it became a tall skyscraper 

Then it grew into a kite 
and flew far out of sight ...

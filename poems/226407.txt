title : Conches on Christmas

Diluvian, draggled and derelict posse, this 
barnacled pod so pales 
next to everything we hear of red tides and pilot whales 
that a word like “drama” makes me sound remiss 

except that there 
was a kind of littoral drama in the way the shells 
silently, sans the heraldry of bells, 
neatly, sans an astrological affair, 

and swiftly, sans a multitude of feet, flat-out arrived— 
an encrusted school of twenty-four 
Gabriellan trumpets at my beach house door 
and barely half-alive. 

Oh, you can bet 
I picked them up, waded right up to my ankles in 
there among ’em, hefted ’em up to my ears to hear the din 
of all things oceanwise and wet, 

but every of the ancient, bearded, anthracite, 
salt-water-logged spirals, 
every of the massive and unwieldy, magisterial 
mollusks shut tight— 

no din, no horns roaring reveille, no warning, no beat, no taps, 
no coral corpus, 
no porpoise purpose 
except it was a secret purpose kept strictly under wraps. 

A fine Christmas gift indeed, this 
obscure migration, 
this half-dead conch confederation 
which would have smelled yon tannenbaum like fish— 

a fine set of unwrappable presents 
and no receipt by which I could redeem them. 
I lifted one up by its stem 
and thought of how, by increments, 

all twenty-four 
must have lugged those preassembled bodies here 
sans Santa, sleigh, and eight little reindeer, 
to my drasty stretch of shore. 

And, no other explanation being offered for the situation, 
I thought that I might understand 
how one could argue that the impulse driving them to land 
was a sort of evolutionary one— 

misguided, yes, redundant, a million years too late, 
a needless, maybe rogue and almost campy 
demonstration of how history, 
even in the world of the invertebrate, 

repeats itself—breaker 
crashing down on breaker in the Gulf, Gulf War 
coming after Gulf War. 
O Maker, 

there is so much slug inside these shells, 
here, at the end of December, 
at the edge of a world I couldn’t blame if you did not remember. 
Miracles sell well, 

but Lord, it can be numbing 
to a people who cannot 
tell between a second nature and a second thought, 
a second chance, or a second coming.

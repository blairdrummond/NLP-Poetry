title : Man Dancing with a Baby

author : Susan Stewart

text : 
Before balance, before counting, before   
The record glistens and the needle slides,   
Grating, into the overture, there is the end   
Of weight, the leaning into nothing and then 

A caught breath, the record listens, the needle slides   
Over slowly, and all at once around us a woman’s voice   
Stretches weightless, leaning into nothing. 
Like a clothesline, the taut chorus: oh, hilarious 

Oh baby, all around us, over slowly, a woman’s voice   
Gathers above the pick me up, pick me up 
And the desperate put, put me down. First the tightrope,   
Then the light foot, and the taunting chorus 

Pick me up, pick me up. Oh, oh baby. 
The slippery floor shimmers and spins like a record while   
The light is swinging footloose on its rope 
Out of time. The shadows 

Slip, shimmering black, and spin across the floor, 
Then turn back and pick up again. Oh seedpod stuck for just   
One moment on the cattail, out of time, out of shadows,   
Downy cheek against a beard: oh scratches 

On the record, oh baby, oh measure   
Oh strange balance that grips us   
On this side of the world.

Common Measure

I haled me a woman from the street, 
   Shameless, but, oh, so fair! 
I bade her sit in the model's seat 
   And I painted her sitting there. 

I hid all trace of her heart unclean; 
   I painted a babe at her breast; 
I painted her as she might have been 
   If the Worst had been the Best. 

She laughed at my picture and went away. 
   Then came, with a knowing nod, 
A connoisseur, and I heard him say; 
   "'Tis Mary, the Mother of God." 

So I painted a halo round her hair, 
   And I sold her and took my fee, 
And she hangs in the church of Saint Hillaire, 
   Where you and all may see.

title : If Love Now Reigned As It Hath Been

author : Henry VIII, king of England

text : 
If love now reigned as it hath been 
And were rewarded as it hath sin, 

Noble men then would sure ensearch 
All ways whereby they might it reach, 

But envy reigneth with such disdain 
And causeth lovers outwardly to refrain, 

Which puts them to more and more 
Inwardly most grievous and sore. 

The fault in whom I cannot set, 
But let them tell which love doth getâ€” 

To lovers I put now sure this case: 
Which of their loves doth get them grace? 

And unto them which doth it know 
Better than do I, I think it so.

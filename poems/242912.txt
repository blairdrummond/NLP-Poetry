Listen. Put on morning.
 Waken into falling light.
 A man’s imagining
 Suddenly may inherit
 The handclapping centuries
 Of his one minute on earth. 
 And hear the virgin juries
 Talk with his own breath
 To the corner boys of his street.
 And hear the Black Maria
 Searching the town at night.
 And hear the playropes caa
 The sister Mary in.
 And hear Willie and Davie
 Among bracken of Narnain
 Sing in a mist heavy
 With myrtle and listeners.
 And hear the higher town
 Weep a petition of fears
 At the poorhouse close upon
 The public heartbeat.
 And hear the children tig
 And run with my own feet
 Into the netting drag
 Of a suiciding principle.
 Listen. Put on lightbreak.
 Waken into miracle.
 The audience lies awake
 Under the tenements
 Under the sugar docks
 Under the printed moments.
 The centuries turn their locks
 And open under the hill
 Their inherited books and doors
 All gathered to distil
 Like happy berry pickers
 One voice to talk to us. 
 Yes listen. It carries away
 The second and the years
 Till the heart’s in a jacket of snow
 And the head’s in a helmet white
 And the song sleeps to be wakened
 By the morning ear bright.
 Listen. Put on morning.
 Waken into falling light.

title : To Play Pianissimo

author : Lola Haskins

text : 
Does not mean silence. 
The absence of moon in the day sky 
for example. 

Does not mean barely to speak, 
the way a child's whisper 
makes only warm air 
on his mother's right ear. 

To play pianissimo 
is to carry sweet words 
to the old woman in the last dark row 
who cannot hear anything else, 
and to lay them across her lap like a shawl.

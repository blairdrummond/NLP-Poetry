title : Hotel

text : 
Time to recount the sparrows of the air. 
Seated alone on an elected stair, 
I stare as they appear and disappear.

Tonight the deck supports tremendous quiet,
although the twilight is itself a riot.
I’m glad I’m staying here, not at the Hyatt.

My pen, eye, notes, watch, whiskey glass and hell 
all hang together comfortably well. 
Pain is my favorite resort hotel.

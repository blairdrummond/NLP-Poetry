he picks a coin up 
from the ground 

it burns his hand 
like ashes it is red 

& marks him as it marks 
the others      hidden 

he is hidden in the forest 
in a world of nails 

his dibbik fills him

Each night another one would hang himself. Airless boxcars. 
Kaddish. "What will they do with us?" The brown & black 
spots on their bellies. So many clothes. The field was littered. 
Ten thousand corpses in one place. Arranged in layers. I am 
moving down the field from right to left—reversing myself at 
every step. The ground approaches. Money. And still his great- 
est fear was that he would lose his shoes.

earth, growing fat with 
the slime of corpses      green & pink 

that ooze like treacle, turn 
into a kind of tallow 

that are black 
at evening       that absorb 

all light

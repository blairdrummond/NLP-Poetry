title : Crossing the Days

author : James Scruton

text : 
My son's been learning time: big hand 
and little, powers of sixty 
and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore 
of days. He's brought home paper plates 
from kindergarten, arrows pointing 
at his favorite hours. So far 
the face of every clock has smiled. 

And before we read to sleep each night 
he crosses off another square 
on the calendar above his bed, 
counting down to Christmas or to nothing 
in particular, sometimes just a line 
he draws uphill or down, check marks 
like the ones his teacher leaves 

on sheets he's filled with capitals 
and lower cases, other times a pair 
of thick lines like the crossed bones 
on a pirate's flag, an X 
as if to mark the treasure buried 
in some ordinary week, 
no day yet a cross to bear.

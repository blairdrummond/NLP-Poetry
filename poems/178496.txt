text : 
The natives here enjoy a delicate   
      and tense society. 
   Their upper classes make an art   
         of conversation 

so refined that no Caucasian ever   
      participates without 
   making at least one outrageous   
         faux pas. 

Few Europeans, in fact, can manage   
      even the rudiments 
   of this language, which consists   
         of vowels only, 

and, although several grammars have been composed   
      by reputable scholars, 
   these disagree on every major 
         point of syntax. 

The chieftains are invariably stout: 
      a proverb says “Fat men must 
   be sure; doubt and misgivings need 
         agility.” 

The special term for this is rendered as   
      “complacency” in all 
   the lexicons, but is in no wise 
         derogatory.

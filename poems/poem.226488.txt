Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop

I met the Bishop on the road 
And much said he and I. 
`Those breasts are flat and fallen now 
Those veins must soon be dry; 
Live in a heavenly mansion, 
Not in some foul sty.' 

`Fair and foul are near of kin, 
And fair needs foul,' I cried. 
'My friends are gone, but that's a truth 
Nor grave nor bed denied, 
Learned in bodily lowliness 
And in the heart's pride. 

`A woman can be proud and stiff 
When on love intent; 
But Love has pitched his mansion in 
The place of excrement; 
For nothing can be sole or whole 
That has not been rent.'

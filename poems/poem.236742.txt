                         I
 
O come you pious youth! adore
    The wisdom of thy God,
In bringing thee from distant shore,
    To learn His holy word.
                                                 Eccles. xii.
 
                         II
 
Thou mightst been left behind
    Amidst a dark abode;
God's tender mercy still combin'd,
    Thou hast the holy word.
                                         Psal. cxxxv, 2, 3.
 
                         III
 
Fair wisdom's ways are paths of peace,
    And they that walk therein,
Shall reap the joys that never cease,
    And Christ shall be their king.
                                Psal. i, 1,2; Prov. iii, 7.
 
                         IV
 
God's tender mercy brought thee here;
    Tost o'er the raging main;
In Christian faith thou hast a share,
    Worth all the gold of Spain.
                                        Psal. cii, 1, 3, 4.
 
                         V

title : Myself and My Person

author : Anna Swir

text : 
There are moments 
when I feel more clearly than ever 
that I am in the company 
of my own person. 
This comforts and reassures me, 
this heartens me, 
just as my tridimensional body 
is heartened by my own authentic shadow. 

There are moments 
when I really feel more clearly than ever   
that I am in the company 
of my own person. 

I stop 
at a street corner to turn left 
and I wonder what would happen 
if my own person walked to the right. 

Until now that has not happened   
but it does not settle the question.

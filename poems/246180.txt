My daughter
                        wouldn’t hurt a spider 
That had nested 
Between her bicycle handles 
For two weeks 
She waited 
Until it left of its own accord

If you tear down the web I said 
It will simply know 
This isn’t a place to call home 
And you’d get to go biking

She said that’s how others 
Become refugees isn’t it?

                 Thunder outdoors
 He stacks shelves, though his children’s dishes file in as if by themselves:
                 A pair of plates just there,
                 Six gaudy tumblers directly under,
 So the baby daughter’s safety cup is crowded.
                  There’s something about it
                  — The household’s loose order — that generally reassures,
                  And the storm’s still far.
  
                  One’s life, dear clutter
 Assumed across the years. Me becomes Mine, Us become Ours.
                  Here is another, older
                 Girl’s bowl that she made in school,
 3rd grade. Pastiche of colors, a serpent
                  Turns a circuit,
                  Begins as gold, goes black around the border.
                  Her father considers
  
                  Beautiful miles,
 Their puzzling splendors: for instance how he and his two little brothers
                  Would kneel by that tall pile
                  Of swimming hole rocks, in one of whose clefts
 A snake always lisped, jetting its feces. They reeked.
                  A single peek,
                  And the younger boys thought, This is danger. But each a child,
                  Each smiled.
  
                  Stink and sweat.
 Rough nap of his towel. Minor quake of lightning down in his bowels
                  As he probed the crack with a stick.
                  Half-cruel, he smiled at the snake’s recoil

title : It Was All for Him

author : Ameen Rihani

text : 
I strolled upon the Brooklyn Bridge one day,
             Beneath the storm;
 None but a lad in rags upon the way
 I saw;—there on a bench he lay
             Heedless of form. 
  
 He seemingly was reading what the Shower
    Was publishing upon the Bridge and down the Bay;
 Yet he was writing, writing at this hour,—
    Writing in a careless sort of way. 
  
 Upon a pad he scribbled and as fast the rain
    Retouched, effaced, corrected and revised. 
 Was he recording Nature’s solemn strain,
    Or sketching choristers therein disguised? 
  
 Whatever it be, I found myself quite by his side: 
    My nod and smile he pocketed and wrote again;
 “Read me your drizzling stuff,” I said, and he replied:
    “I’ve written a check in payment for this shower of rain.”

title : Homage to H & the Speedway Diner

It’s alot like a cave full of pictures 
& black & white checked flags 
you may overdose on caffeine 
it’s the closest restaurant to our house 
maybe five miles, it’s very cheap 
you can go there when you have almost no money 
they let you use the telephone 
i can get steak tartare there for $2.25 
but i’ve never called it that 
just raw hamburger with an egg yolk, 
pickle relish & garlic powder plus 
the celtic salt i bring along 
the owner, h (after whom the h-burger is named) 
is loquacious, surprising, has a santa claus belly & wears suspenders 
there’s ashtrays everywhere & a great old pinball machine 
it’s like east nassau but it’s in west lebanon i think 
you can always talk about the weather & hunting 
the clientele is open-minded as are the waitress & waiter 
who kneels when he takes your order 
during hunting season it opens at 4:30 a.m. 
it’s for sale but that’s not quite serious 
h’s wife thinks he spends too much time there (which he does) 
so she started calling him by their dog’s name, peaches 
h is a big fan of northern exposure, oh & i 
forgot to mention the biscuits & sausage gravy 
which are genuine, greyish & great. recently 
h got a smoker & this year we’ll go to the new year’s 
eve party & eat stuffed shrimp and/or lobster

title : Tear

author : Linda Hogan

text : 
It was the time before
 I was born.
 I was thin.
 I was hungry. I was
 only a restlessness inside a woman’s body.
  
 Above us, lightning split open the sky.
 Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.
 Around us were the soldiers,
 young and afraid,
 who did not trust us
 with scissors or knives
 but with needles.
  
 Tear dresses they were called
 because settler cotton was torn
 in straight lines
 like the roads we had to follow
 to Oklahoma.
  
 But when the cloth was torn,
 it was like tears,
 impossible to hold back,
 and so they were called
 by this other name,
 for our weeping.
  
 I remember the women.
 Tonight they walk
 out from the shadows
 with black dogs,
 children, the dark heavy horses,
 and worn-out men.
  
 They walk inside me. This blood
 is a map of the road between us.
 I am why they survived.
 The world behind them did not close.
 The world before them is still open.
 All around me are my ancestors,
 my unborn children.
 I am the tear between them
 and both sides live.

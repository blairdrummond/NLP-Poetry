Sonnet 141: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes 
William Shakespeare 
1564-1616
Renaissance
England
Love, Classic Love, Unrequited Love



In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, 
For they in thee a thousand errors note; 
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise, 
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote; 
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted, 
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone, 
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited 
To any sensual feast with thee alone: 
But my five wits nor my five senses can 
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, 
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, 
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be. 
   Only my plague thus far I count my gain, 
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

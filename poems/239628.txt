title : Denial

He called it “his ranch,” 
yet each winter day found her beside him 
feeding hay to hungry cows.

In summer heat 
you would find her in the hayfield— 
cutting, raking, baling, stacking.

In between she kept the books, 
cooked, cleaned 
laundered, fed bum lambs.

Garden rows straight, 
canned jars of food 
lined cellar walls.

Then she died. 
I asked him how he would manage. 
“Just like I always have,” he said.

1. READING THE RESULTS

I don’t move,
but the inside corner
of my right eye turns glassy,
then shatters,

hands focus more sharply.

I don’t move,
but the pigeon shudders
on the sill.

The door opens to a maze
of wallpaper, family photos—
their bliss-frieze burns
the last unaffected corner of my sight,
like molten Karo.

My husband’s mouth collapses,
and the air about his shoulders
has crystallized.
We don’t say a word,
all the noise is around us,
the letter, half-folded, on the desk,
an albatross, a dove.


2. POSITIVE

Because in those days there were no words
for such things I took handfuls of vitamins and slept
with a trumpet flower under my pillow, I ate
at the Kiev on Second Avenue at four every morning:
enormous boiled potato pierogis shivering in pools
of butter, little sides of sautéed onions, paper cups of pure
sour cream, Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray, no ice, as chaser,

but now when the call comes I’m sitting in the kitchen
with two plastic funnels over my breasts and the pump
on the coutner with its hydraulic suck and the cast iron
sputtering of eggs, the kids already bickering at table,
milk flowing into baby bottles, even now the word
heroin makes me feel the lovely way
a body can go slack from inside out.


3. A SINGLE DROP

I’d never paid much mind
     to my implements, but now
          I paint “Fire Engine Red”

on the handle of my razor, a single drop
     on my nail clippers, one long
          stroke on my lethal toothbrush

to cordon off my blood,
     I tend and sop each splash or seep,
          soiled band-aids, love-smeared sheets—

every bleeding gum, torn hangnail,
     paper cut, scrape, gully  of cracked lip
          another hazard, each

infectious throb now
     forever watched as I patrol
          my body’s raging arroyo

in the family bathroom,
     to keep my children
          safe from me.


4. PAPER GOWNS

X-rays, lab coat, and me wearing
those delicate petals (gaping,
cold through the sleeves).
He asks me to extend my palms:
the motion is of pushing away.
Breathe with your mouth, he says, soft
tup, tup, tup, along my spine,
as if checking a cantaloupe.

There is a piece of gum
beneath the windowsill,
green imprint of a thumb.
We’re talking percentages, genotypes,
we’re talking bundled pharmaceuticals.
Studies, it seems, are inconclusive.

I try to look at the big picture:
a talc-free rubber glove at the edge of the trash,
neither in, nor out. On the insurance card,
raised numbers, black ink worn away.
There's a girl on the street with her head back,
the strap of her dress falling carelessly.

“The trouble with intellectuals,” Manny, my boss,   
once told me, “is that they don’t know nothing   
till they can explain it to themselves.  A guy like that,”   
he said, “he gets to middle age—and by the way,   
he gets there late; he’s trying to be a boy until   
he’s forty, forty-five, and then you give him five   
more years until that craziness peters out, and now   
he’s almost fifty—a guy like that at last explains   
to himself that life is made of time, that time   
is what it’s all about.  Aha! he says.  And then   
he either blows his brains out, gets religion,   
or settles down to some major-league depression.   
Make yourself useful.  Hand me that three-eights   
torque wrench—no, you moron, the other one.”

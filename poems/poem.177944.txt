Couplet

Alas, how pleasant are their days 
With whom the infant Love yet plays! 
Sorted by pairs, they still are seen 
By fountains cool, and shadows green. 
But soon these flames do lose their light, 
Like meteors of a summer's night: 
Nor can they to that region climb, 
To make impression upon time.

'Twas in a shipwreck, when the seas 
Ruled, and the winds did what they please, 
That my poor lover floating lay,
And, ere brought forth, was cast away: 
Till at the last the master-wave
Upon the rock his mother drave;
And there she split against the stone, 
In a Caesarean section.

The sea him lent those bitter tears
Which at his eyes he always wears;
And from the winds the sighs he bore, 
Which through his surging breast do roar. 
No day he saw but that which breaks 
Through frighted clouds in forked streaks, 
While round the rattling thunder hurled, 
As at the funeral of the world.

While Nature to his birth presents 
This masque of quarrelling elements,
A numerous fleet of cormorants black,
That sailed insulting o'er the wrack, 
Received into their cruel care 
Th' unfortunate and abject heir: 
Guardians most fit to entertain 
The orphan of the hurricane.

They fed him up with hopes and air, 
Which soon digested to despair, 
And as one cormorant fed him, still 
Another on his heart did bill,
Thus while they famish him, and feast, 
He both consumed, and increased: 
And languished with doubtful breath, 
The amphibium of life and death.

And now, when angry heaven would
Behold a spectacle of blood, 
Fortune and he are called to play 
At sharp before it all the day:
And tyrant Love his breast does ply
With all his winged artillery,
Whilst he, betwixt the flames and waves, 
Like Ajax, the mad tempest braves.

See how he nak'd and fierce does stand, 
Cuffing the thunder with one hand,
While with the other he does lock,
And grapple, with the stubborn rock: 
From which he with each wave rebounds, 
Torn into flames, and ragg'd with wounds, 
And all he 'says, a lover dressed
In his own blood does relish best.

This is the only banneret 
That ever Love created yet:
Who though, by the malignant stars,
Forced to live in storms and wars, 
Yet dying leaves a perfume here, 
And music within every ear: 
And he in story only rules, 
In a field sable a lover gules.

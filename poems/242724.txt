title : Second Life

author : James Longenbach

text : 
Accompanied
To the Campi Flegrei
By a shadow,
 
She listened to voices rise
From the darkness,
Then recede.
 
Instruments
Sustained them.
When one had finished
 
Others played.
False proportions
Sung boldly.
 
Rain on the roof tiles.
O selve, o campi.

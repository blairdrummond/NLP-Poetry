Common Measure

When fishes flew and forests walked   
   And figs grew upon thorn,   
Some moment when the moon was blood   
   Then surely I was born. 

With monstrous head and sickening cry 
   And ears like errant wings,   
The devil's walking parody   
   On all four-footed things. 

The tattered outlaw of the earth, 
   Of ancient crooked will; 
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,   
   I keep my secret still. 

Fools! For I also had my hour; 
   One far fierce hour and sweet:   
There was a shout about my ears, 
   And palms before my feet.

Rhymed Stanza

Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
         And the elves also,
         Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

No Will-o'-th'-Wisp mis-light thee,
Nor snake or slow-worm bite thee;
         But on, on thy way,
         Not making a stay,
Since ghost there's none to affright thee.

Let not the dark thee cumber;
What though the moon does slumber?
         The stars of the night
         Will lend thee their light,
Like tapers clear without number.

Then Julia let me woo thee,
Thus, thus to come unto me;
         And when I shall meet
         Thy silv'ry feet,
My soul I'll pour into thee.

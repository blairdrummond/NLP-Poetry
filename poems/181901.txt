The perfect mother lets the cat 
sleep on her head. The 
children laugh. 
Where is she? 
She is not carefully ironing the starched 
ruffles of a Sunday dress. 
What does she say? 
She does not speak. 
Her head is under the cat and 
like the cat, she sleeps.

But her children are in a marsh! 
Bogged, they have gone wild. 
Yet, no one should worry. 
See, they are there, in a sunny kitchen. 
They drink cups of soup and wipe 
their faces with yellow napkins. 
What does it matter if 
they are hatching plots, if 
in their waking dreams 
the poor cat is trapped 
its hair 
standing on end?

Where shall we go? We ask the perfect 
mother. What 
do you want of us? She is no 
where to be found. 
Not in the cookie jar 
we have broken to bits 
not under the shiny kitchen floor 
not on our lips. 
Here we are transfixed, 
mourning the perfect mother, and she 
is caught in the trapped cat 
of her children’s dreams.

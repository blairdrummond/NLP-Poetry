title : Mingus at the Showplace

author : William Matthews

text : 
I was miserable, of course, for I was seventeen, 
and so I swung into action and wrote a poem, 

and it was miserable, for that was how I thought 
poetry worked: you digested experience and shat 

literature. It was 1960 at The Showplace, long since 
defunct, on West 4th St., and I sat at the bar, 

casting beer money from a thin reel of ones, 
the kid in the city, big ears like a puppy. 

And I knew Mingus was a genius. I knew two 
other things, but they were wrong, as it happened. 

So I made him look at the poem. 
“There’s a lot of that going around,” he said, 

and Sweet Baby Jesus he was right. He laughed 
amiably. He didn’t look as if he thought 

bad poems were dangerous, the way some poets do. 
If they were baseball executives they’d plot 

to destroy sandlots everywhere so that the game 
could be saved from children.   Of course later 

that night he fired his pianist in mid-number 
and flurried him from the stand. 

“We’ve suffered a diminuendo in personnel,” 
he explained, and the band played on.

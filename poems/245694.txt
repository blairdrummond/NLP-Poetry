title : The Courtship of the Lizard Lover

author : Kate Buckley

text : 
He crawls through the cracks
 of my stone foundation,
  
 sly and sleek as
 I tempt him with food.
  
 He stays out of habit; I cook
 out of love for things that move.
  
 We grow accustomed to each other’s
 trails and smells, the skins we’ve shed
  
 along the long, long road
 of rubbing each other smooth.
  
 Till all the skins we’ve shed lie sparkling
 like so many stones in this desert land.
  
 I scoop him up in my hand
 and eat him.

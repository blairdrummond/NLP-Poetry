Couplet, Epigram

Walking the fields a wantcatcher I spied,
 To him I went, desirous of his game: 
 Sir, have you taken wants? Yes, he replied,
 Here are a dozen, which were lately ta'en. 
 Then you have left no more. No more? quoth he. 
 Sir I can show you more: the more the worse;
 And to his work he went, but 'twould not be,
 For all the wants were crept into my purse. 
      Farewell friend wantcatcher, since 'twill not be,
      Thou cannot catch the wants, but they catch me.

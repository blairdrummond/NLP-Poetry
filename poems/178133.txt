title : The Water Diviner

author : Dannie Abse

text : 
Late, I have come to a parched land   
doubting my gift, if gift I have,   
the inspiration of water 
spilt, swallowed in the sand. 

To hear once more water trickle,   
to stand in a stretch of silence 
the divining pen twisting in the hand:   
sign of depths alluvial. 

Water owns no permanent shape,   
sags, is most itself descending; 
now, under the shadow of the idol,   
dry mouth and dry landscape. 

No rain falls with a refreshing sound   
to settle tubular in a well, 
elliptical in a bowl. No grape 
lusciously moulds it round. 

Clouds have no constant resemblance   
to anything, blown by a hot wind,   
flying mirages; the blue background,   
light constructions of chance. 

To hold back chaos I transformed   
amorphous mass—and fire and cloud—   
so that the agèd gods might dance   
and golden structures form. 

I should have built, plain brick on brick,   
a water tower. The sun flies on 
arid wastes, barren hells too warm   
and me with a hazel stick! 

Rivulets vanished in the dust 
long ago, great compositions 
vaporized, salt on the tongue so thick   
that drinking, still I thirst. 

Repeated desert, recurring drought,   
sometimes hearing water trickle,   
sometimes not, I, by doubting first,   
believe; believing, doubt.

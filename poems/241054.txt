title : Canto LXXXI

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
Zeus lies in Ceres’ bosom
 Taishan is attended of loves
                         under Cythera, before sunrise
 And he said: “Hay aquí mucho catolicismo—(sounded
                                                             catolithismo
                       y muy poco reliHion.”
 and he said: “Yo creo que los reyes desparecen”
 (Kings will, I think, disappear)
 This was Padre José Elizondo
                                         in 1906 and in 1917
 or about 1917
                 and Dolores said: “Come pan, niño,”   eat bread, me lad
 Sargent had painted her
                                         before he descended
 (i.e. if he descended 
                 but in those days he did thumb sketches,
 impressions of the Velázquez in the Museo del Prado
 and books cost a peseta,
                          brass candlesticks in proportion, 
 hot wind came from the marshes
        and death-chill from the mountains. 
 And later Bowers wrote: “but such hatred,
        I have never conceived such”
 and the London reds wouldn’t show up his friends
                         (i.e. friends of Franco
 working in London) and in Alcázar
 forty years gone, they said: go back to the station to eat
 you can sleep here for a peseta”
                goat bells tinkled all night
                and the hostess grinned: Eso es luto, haw!
 mi marido es muerto
                  (it is mourning, my husband is dead)
 when she gave me a paper to write on
 with a black border half an inch or more deep,
        say 5/8ths, of the locanda
 “We call all foreigners frenchies”
 and the egg broke in Cabranez’ pocket, 
                 thus making history. Basil says
 they beat drums for three days
 till all the drumheads were busted
                  (simple village fiesta)
 and as for his life in the Canaries…
 Possum observed that the local portagoose folk dance
 was danced by the same dancers in divers localities
                 in political welcome…
 the technique of demonstration
                 Cole studied that (not G.D.H., Horace)
 “You will find” said old André Spire,
 that every man on that board (Crédit Agricole)
 has a brother-in-law
                         “You the one, I the few”
                         said John Adams
 speaking of fears in the abstract
          to his volatile friend Mr Jefferson. 
 (To break the pentameter, that was the first heave)
 or as Jo Bard says:   they never speak to each other,
 if it is baker and concierge visibly
                it is La Rouchefoucauld and de Maintenon audibly.
 “Te cavero le budella”
                               “La corata a te”
 In less than a geological epoch
                                       said Henry Mencken
 “Some cook, some do not cook
        some things cannot be altered”
 ’Iugx.  .  .  .  . ’emòn potí dwma aòn andra
 What counts is the cultural level,
         thank Benin for this table ex packing box
         “doan yu tell no one I made it”
                       from a mask fine as any in Frankfurt
 “It’ll get you offn th’ groun”
                       Light as the branch of Kuanon
 And at first disappointed with shoddy
 the bare ram-shackle quais, but then saw the 
 high buggy wheels 
                       and was reconciled,
 George Santayana arriving in the port of Boston
 and kept to the end of his life that faint thethear
 of the Spaniard
                         as grace quasi imperceptible
 as did Muss the v for u of Romagna
 and said the grief was a full act
               repeated for each new condoleress
 working up to a climax.
 and George Horace said he wd/ “get Beveridge” (Senator)
 Beveridge wouldn’t talk and he wouldn’t write for the papers
 but George got him by campin’ in his hotel
 and assailin’ him at lunch breakfast an’ dinner
                         three articles
 and my ole man went on hoein’ corn
        while George was a-tellin’ him,
 come across a vacant lot
                 where you’d occasionally see a wild rabbit
 or mebbe only a loose one
             AOI!
             a leaf in the current
                                            at my grates no Althea

 Yet
 Ere the season died a-cold
 Borne upon a zephyr’s shoulder
 I rose through the aureate sky
                                Lawes and Jenkyns guard thy rest
                                Dolmetsch ever be thy guest,
 Has he tempered the viol’s wood
 To enforce   both the grave   and the acute? 
 Has he curved us the bowl of the lute?
                                Lawes and Jenkyns guard thy rest
                                Dolmetsch ever be thy guest
 Hast ’ou fashioned so airy a mood
        To draw up leaf from the root?
 Hast ’ou found   a cloud   so light
         As seemed neither mist nor shade?
             
                                 Then resolve me, tell me aright
                                  If Waller sang or Dowland played
             
                    Your eyen two wol sleye me sodenly
                     I may the beauté of hem nat susteyne
  
 And for 180 years almost nothing. 
  
 Ed ascoltando al leggier mormorio
         there came new subtlety of eyes into my tent,
 whether of the spirit or hypostasis,
             but what the blindfold hides
 or at carneval
                                   nor any pair showed anger
             Saw but the eyes and stance between the eyes,
 colour, diastasis,
       careless or unaware it had not the
    whole tent’s room
 nor was place for the full EidwV
 interpass, penetrate
       casting but shade beyond the other lights
               sky’s clear
               night’s sea
               green of the mountain pool
               shone from the unmasked eyes in half-mask’s space. 
 What thou lovest well remains, 
                                                   the rest is dross
 What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
 What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage
 Whose world, or mine or theirs
                                             or is it of none? 
 First came the seen, then thus the palpable
         Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell,
 What thou lovest well is thy true heritage
 What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
  
 The ant’s a centaur in his dragon world.
 Pull down thy vanity, it is not man
 Made courage, or made order, or made grace,
          Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down.
 Learn of the green world what can be thy place
 In scaled invention or true artistry,
 Pull down thy vanity,
                                         Paquin pull down!
 The green casque has outdone your elegance.
  
 “Master thyself, then others shall thee beare”
        Pull down thy vanity
 Thou art a beaten dog beneath the hail,
 A swollen magpie in a fitful sun,
 Half black half white
 Nor knowst’ou wing from tail
 Pull down thy vanity
                         How mean thy hates
 Fostered in falsity,
                         Pull down thy vanity,
 Rathe to destroy, niggard in charity,
 Pull down thy vanity,
                        I say pull down. 
  
 But to have done instead of not doing
                      this is not vanity
 To have, with decency, knocked
 That a Blunt should open
                To have gathered from the air a live tradition
 or from a fine old eye the unconquered flame
 This is not vanity. 
          Here error is all in the not done,
 all in the diffidence that faltered  .  .  .

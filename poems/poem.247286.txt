I would not paint -- a picture -- (348) 
Emily Dickinson

I would not paint -- a picture -- 
I'd rather be the One
It's bright impossibility
To dwell -- delicious -- on --
And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rare -- celestial -- stir --
Evokes so sweet a torment -- 
Such sumptuous -- Despair --

I would not talk, like Cornets --
I'd rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings --
And out, and easy on --
Through Villages of Ether --
Myself endued Balloon
By but a lip of Metal --
The pier to my Pontoon --

Nor would I be a Poet --
It's finer -- Own the Ear --
Enamored -- impotent -- content --
The License to revere,
A privilege so awful 
What would the Dower be,
Had I the Art to stun myself
With Bolts -- of Melody!

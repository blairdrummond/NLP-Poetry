Play the one about the family of the ducks 
where the ducks go down to the river 
and one of them thinks the water will be cold 
but then they jump in anyway 
and like it and splash around. 

No, I must play the one 
about the nervous man from Palestine in row 14 
with a brown bag in his lap 
in which a gun is hidden in a sandwich. 

Play the one about the handsome man and woman 
standing on the steps of her apartment 
and how the darkness and her perfume and the beating of their hearts 
conjoin to make them feel 
like leaping from the edge of chance— 

No, I should play the one about 
the hard rectangle of the credit card 
hidden in the man’s back pocket 
and how the woman spent an hour 
plucking out her brows, and how her perfume 
was made from the destruction of a hundred flowers. 

Then play the one about the flower industry 
in which the migrant workers curse their own infected hands 
from tossing sheaves of roses and carnations 
into the back of the refrigerated trucks. 

No, I must play the one about the single yellow daffodil 
standing on my kitchen table 
whose cut stem draws the water upwards 
so the plant is flushed with the conviction 

that the water has been sent 
to find and raise it up 
from somewhere so deep inside the earth 
not even flowers can remember.

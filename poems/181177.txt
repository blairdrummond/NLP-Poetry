the deep male growl of the sea-lashed headland â€”Sophocles, Philoctetes
August long ago, the summer Lemnian 
(not like the deeds of those who killed their men), 
the self a glowing bead, like Hephaestus falling 
daylong out of heaven in the old story, 
the island's interior a forge, a glory hole, 
the odor of wild thyme borne offshore steadily, 
the Aegean Sea purple, wine-dark, without epithet; 
and as I walked on the beach, my mother not long dead, 
the perfect crystal of my self-regard 
so lately flawed, and landscape made to echo 
my own low cry in the island's empty places, 
I found a pure white bone that wind and salt 
had scoured of every grief and all self-pity: 
and so I came to the love of others.

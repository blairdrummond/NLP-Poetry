title : The Suicide

author : John Wieners

text : 
Yes I put her away.
       But now life flares up
    As safe as China in a cup
    You hear the droppings
              of her heart.
  
    Leaves rustle on the windowpane.
 Three o’clock turns round again.
 The man in the moon grows full
 Of her death while earth awaits
    beneath
 To receive her ashes on the wind.
  
        Yes, earth owns the wind
        As I her life
        Whom I have never seen
        Nor been with
 Still within our hearts there lies
           this communion
              of all that dies
    we held in common
    because without it
  
 we become more common than the dust.
  
  
                             2.
  
 Clay cannot create her features
 nor mirror reveal her mouth
  
 Photograph not show her form
 full with self, so put away
  
 her picture from the shelf
 And turn instead to living
  
 woman on the couch, decked with flowers
 as if it were she laid out,
  
 and not Sylvia, in the woods.

Address to the Woman
 
 Tell her that may not rise again
 she sings still in our breath.
  
 Tell her that may not breathe again
 she moves yet beneath the moon.
  
 Tell her that may not weave again
 her hands are dawns within our eyes.
  
 Tell her that may not speak again
 Her words are warnings in the wood.

title : Vase Poppies

Lavenderish dusk
 strapped for stays,
 pomegranates under the rubberband
 chucked for a glass Oz,
  
 letdown
 splayed by the pillar-shelves
 to page upon the Ottoman:
  
 his talk has wrought suit
 amid citrus gapes
 and pall dunked in the bowl
 and grated sage
 or cleaved clear paleo-pines.
  
 Postgeist, upcast
 California upon weed,
 what banker yields
 so fragrant a cant
 as this vagrant cant?

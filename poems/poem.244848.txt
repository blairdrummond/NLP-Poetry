He is gone, the strong base of the nation,
     The dove to his covet has fled;
 Ye heroes lament his privation,
     For Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone down, the sun of the Union,
     Like Phoebus, that sets in the west;
 The planet of peace and communion,
     Forever has gone to his rest.
  
 He is gone down from a world of commotion,
     No equal succeeds in his stead;
 His wonders extend with the ocean,
     Whose waves murmur, Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone and can ne'er be forgotten,
     Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom;
 When gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten,
     His deeds will break forth from the tomb.
  
 He is gone out of glory to glory,
     A smile with the tear may be shed,
 O, then let us tell the sweet story,
     Triumphantly, Lincoln is dead.

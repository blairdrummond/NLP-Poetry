title : Mr. Nobody

text : 
I know a funny little man, 
    As quiet as a mouse, 
Who does the mischief that is done 
    In everybody’s house! 
There’s no one ever sees his face, 
    And yet we all agree 
That every plate we break was cracked 
    By Mr. Nobody. 

’Tis he who always tears out books, 
    Who leaves the door ajar, 
He pulls the buttons from our shirts, 
    And scatters pins afar; 
That squeaking door will always squeak, 
    For prithee, don’t you see, 
We leave the oiling to be done 
    By Mr. Nobody. 

The finger marks upon the door 
    By none of us are made; 
We never leave the blinds unclosed, 
    To let the curtains fade. 
The ink we never spill;   the boots 
    That lying round you see 
Are not our boots,—they all belong 
    To Mr. Nobody.

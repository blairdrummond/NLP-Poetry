I tracked it through the one mind of  the woods. 
Its hoofprints pressed in snow were smallish hearts. 
Buck fawn: he let me come so near, take aim. 
Crouched against a fir, I was anything. 
Bush, stump, doe in estrus he could rut. 
Not his maimer, though, not his final thought. 
He stared me down until I shot him: low. 
Then the forest forgot he’d ever been. 
Nascent, there were signs: bonechip, spoor, frail hair. 
But no memory, wounded, wants to die. 
He hid in the dark timber, twice crossed the creek. 
Finally he lay heaving out last breaths. 
Dusk-cast shadow, he died where he was made. 
A bite of  heart sustains but is not him.

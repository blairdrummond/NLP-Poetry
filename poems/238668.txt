He was tall, lean, serious 
about his profession, 
said it disturbed him 
to see mismatched teeth. 
Squinting, he asked me 
to turn toward the light 
as he held an unglazed crown 
by my upper incisors. 
With a small brush he applied 
yellow, gray, pink, violet 
and green from a palette of glazes, 
then fired it at sixteen hundred  
degrees. We went outside 
to check the final color, 
and he was pleased. Today 
the dentist put it in my mouth, 
and no one could ever guess 
my secret: there’s no one quite 
like me, and I can prove it 
by the unique shade of 
the ivory sculptures attached 
to bony sockets in my jaw. 
A gallery opens when I smile. 
Even the forgery gleams.

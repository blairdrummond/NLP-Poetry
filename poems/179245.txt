title : I Love Your Crazy Bones

author : Barton Sutter

text : 
Even your odds and ends. 
I love your teeth, crazy bones, 
Madcap knees and elbows. 
Forearm and backhand 
Hair makes you animal. 
Rare among things. 
The small of your back could pool rain 
Into water a main might drink. Perfect, 
From the whirlpools your fingers print 
On everything you touch 
To the moons on the nails of all ten toes 
Rising and setting inside your shoes 
Wherever you go.

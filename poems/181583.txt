text : 
Did wind and wave design the albatross's wing, 
honed compliances: or is it effrontery to 
suggest that the wing designed the gales and 

seas: are we guests here, then, with all the 
gratitude and soft-walking of the guest: 
provisions and endurances of riverbeds, 

mountain shoulders, windings through of tulip 
poplar, grass, and sweet-frosted foxgrape: 
are we to come into these and leave them as 

they are: are the rivers in us, and the slopes, 
ours that the world's imitate, or are we 
mirrorments merely of a high designing aloof 

and generous as a host to us: what would 
become of us if we declined and staked out 
a level affirmation of our own: we wind 

the brook into our settlement and husband the 
wind to our sails and blades: what is to 
be grateful when let alone to itself, as for 

a holiday in naturalness: the albatross, ah, 
fishes the waves with a will beyond the 
waves' will, and we, to our own doings, put 

down the rising of sea or mountain slope: except 
we do not finally put it down: still, till 
the host appears, we'll make the masters here.

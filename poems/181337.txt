title : The Song of the Birds

text : 
At the sight of 
the great light dawning   
in that glad night, 
small birds come singing 
to celebrate him 
with their sweet voices. 

And even the imperial 
eagle, soaring on the wind, 
sings a melodious song, 
saying:   Jesus is born 
to lift us from sin 
and bring us joy.

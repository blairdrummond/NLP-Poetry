Refrain, Rhymed Stanza

Lords of the Nursery
    Wait in a row,
 Five on the high wall,
    And four on the low;
 Big Kings and Little Kings,
    Brown Bears and Black,
 All of them waiting
    Till John comes back.
  
 Some think that John boy
    Is lost in the wood,
 Some say he couldn't be,
    Some say he could.
 Some think that John boy
    Hides on the hill;
 Some say he won't come back,
    Some say he will.
  
                           High was the sun, when
                              John went away . . .
                           Here they've been waiting
                              All through the day;
                           Big Bears and Little Bears,
                              White Kings and Black,
                           All of them waiting
                              Till John comes back.
  
 Lords of the Nursery
    Looked down the hill,
 Some saw the sheep-fold,
    Some say the mill;
 Some saw the roofs
    Of the little grey town . . .
 And their shadows grew long
    As the sun slipt down.
  
 Gold between the poplars
    An old moon shows;
 Silver up the star-way
    The full moon rose;
 Silver down the star-way
    The old moon crept . . .
 And, one by another,
    The grey fields slept.
  
 Lords of the Nursery
    Their still watch keep . . .
 They hear from the sheep-fold
    The rustle of sheep.
 A young bird twitters
    And hides its head;
 A little wind suddenly
    Breathes, and is dead.
  
 Slowly and slowly
    Dawns the new day . . .
 What's become of John boy?
    No one can say.
 Some think that John boy
    Is lost on the hill;
 Some say he won't come back,
    Some say he will.
  
 What's become of John boy?
    Nothing at all,
 He played with his skipping rope,
    He played with his ball.
 He ran after butterflies,
    Blue ones and red;
 He did a hundred happy things--
    And then went to bed.

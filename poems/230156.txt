Shooting pleasures   
Ok’d by 
My being seen 
For 
Or as 
If. 

                   * 

Not just light 
at the end of the tunnel, 

but hearts, bows, rainbows— 

all the stickers 
teachers award if pleased. 

                   * 

Pigeons bathe in technicolor   
fluid “of a morning.” 

                   * 

If I was banging 
my head with a shoe, 
I was just exaggerating— 

like raising my voice   
or the ante. 

Curlicues 
on iron gratings: 

Can it be 
a flourish is a grimace, 
but a grimace isn’t a flourish? 

                   * 

On the inscribed surface 
of sleep. 

Almost constant   
bird soundings. 

“Aloha, Fruity Pebbles!” 

Music, useful 
for abstracting emphasis. 

Sweet nothing   
to do with me.

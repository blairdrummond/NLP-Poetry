To the States,

To Identify the 16th, 17th, or 18th Presidentiad.
Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing? 
What deepening twilight--scum floating atop of the waters, 
Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol? 
What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North, your arctic freezings!) 
Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that the President? 
Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for reasons; 
(With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly awake, 
South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)

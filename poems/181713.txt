title : Explaining It

author : William Johnson

text : 
In the woods off Ivory, just out of car-shot 
it’s not enough to say a mouse lies snug 

in a crib of roots, its fur sleek as babyskin, 
Lord the body warm. Too often a name 

subverts the pang it answers for, inwit of   
heart-light, the epiphanic clutch. I mean 

do you sense with more than a chill the tiny 
homely lumpliness of it there in the dirt 

as you orphan the dim of a cold October 
sun, no wound I can find anywhere 

on its, your, my small soft bodykins—yikes 
its left ear (the inner skin pink 

delicate svelte) twitches a little 
and I have this before thought tricks it 

whimsically lovely wink of the soul as 
mouse-force taking wing until the O-no 

letdown when a yellow jacket backs out, 
O sweetmeat funk and dandle of the brain 

asputter as it launches over frost-curled leaves 
and dollarweed seed strewn on the path 

like medallions glimpsed the second we— 
I mean all of us cold in the twilight—fly.

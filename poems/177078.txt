					In cities there are tangerine briefcases on the down-platform   and jet parkas on the up-platform; in the mother of cities   there is equal anxiety at all terminals.     West a business breast, North a morose jig, East a false       escape, South steam in milk.  The centres of cities move westwards; the centre of the   mother of cities has disappeared.     North the great cat, East the great water, South the great       fire, West the great arrow.  In cities the sons of women become fathers; in the mother of   cities the daughters of men have failed to become mothers.     East the uneager fingers, South the damp cave, West the     chained ankle, North the rehearsed cry.  Cities are built for trade, where women and men may freely   through knowing each other become more like themselves;   the mother of cities is built for government, where women   and men through fearing each other become more like each   other than they care to be.     South the short, West the soap, North the sheets, East the       shivers.  In cities the church fund is forever stuck below blood heat; in   the mother of cities the church is a community arts centre.     West the Why-not, North the Now-then, East the End-     product, South the Same-again.  In cities nobody can afford the price; in the mother of cities   nobody dares to ask the price.     North the telephone smile, East the early appointment,       South the second reminder, West the hanging button.  In cities the jealous man is jealous because he is himself in his   imagination unfaithful; in the mother of cities the jealous man   is jealous because he reads the magazines.     East the endless arrival, South the astounding statistic,       West the wasted words, North the night of nights.  In cities we dream about our desires; in the mother of cities   we dream about our dreams.

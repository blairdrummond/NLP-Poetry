 They learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium
 and we all rose into the air,
 the same room where they demonstrated
 pow-wows and prestidigitation.
  
 But not everyone believed it.
 That was the most important lesson
 I learned—that a truck driven by a dog
 could roll down a hill at dusk
 and roll right off a dock into a lake
 and sink, and if no one believes you
 then what is the point
 of telling them wonderful things?
  
 I walked home from the pow-wow
 on an early winter night in amazement:
 they let me buy the toy tomahawk!
 As soon as I got home I was going
 to hit my sister with it, but I didn’t know this.

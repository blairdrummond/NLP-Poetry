Past 
fences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processions 
of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing 
point like fretboards carrying barbed melodies, windharp 
narratives, songs of place, I’m thinking of the long cowboy 
ballads Ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught   
me the ends if he could have remembered them. 
                                                                        But remembering 
was years ago when Ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day 
and found, and played guitar in a Saturday night band, and now 
he is dead and I’m remembering near the end when he just needed 
a drink before he could tie his shoes. 
                                                      We’d stay up all night 
playing the beginnings of songs like Falling Leaf, about a 
girl who died of grief, and Zebra Dun, about a horse that 
pawed the light out of the moon. 
                                              Sometimes Ray would break 
through and recall a few more verses before he’d drop a line 
or scramble a rhyme or just go blank, and his workfat hands 
would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief. 
                                                                        Between 
songs he’d pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that 
sounded like nails in a paper bag. 
                                                 Done, he’d straighten and 
say, My cough’s not just right, I need another cigarette, and 
light the Parliament he bit at an upward angle like Roosevelt 
and play the start of another song. 
                                                   Then, played out and 
drunk enough to go home, he’d pick up his hat and case and 
make it, usually on the second try, through the front gate 
and gently list out into the early morning dark, beginning 
again some song without end, yodeling his vote under spangles.

Rhymed Stanza

Dark as the clouds of even,
 Ranked in the western heaven,
 Waiting the breath that lifts
 All the dread mass, and drifts
 Tempest and falling brand
 Over a ruined land;--
 So still and orderly,
 Arm to arm, knee to knee,
 Waiting the great event,
 Stands the Black Regiment.
  
 Down the long dusky line
 Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;
 And the bright bayonet,
 Bristling and firmly set,
 Flashed with a purpose grand,
 Long ere the sharp command
 Of the fierce rolling drum
 Told them their time had come,
 Told them what work was sent
 For the Black Regiment.
  
 "Now," the flag-sergeant cried,
 "Though death and hell betide,
 Let the whole nation see
 If we are fit to be
 Free in this land; or bound
 Down, like the whining hound,--
 Bound with red stripes of pain
 In our old chains again!"
 Oh, what a shout there went
 From the Black Regiment!
  
 "Charge!" Trump and drum awoke,
 Onward the bondmen broke;
 Bayonet and sabre-stroke
 Vainly opposed their rush.
 Through the wild battle's crush,
 With but one thought aflush,
 Driving their lords like chaff,
 In the guns' mouths they laugh;
 Or at the slippery brands
 Leaping with open hands,
 Down they tear man and horse,
 Down in their awful course;
 Tramping with bloody heel
 Over the crashing steel,
 All their eyes forward bent,
 Rushed the Black Regiment.
  
 "Freedom!" their battle-cry--
 "Freedom! or leave to die!"
 Ah! And they meant the word,
 Not as with us 'tis heard,
 Not a mere party shout:
 They gave their spirits out;
 Trusted the end to God,
 And on the gory sod
 Rolled in triumphant blood.
  
 Glad to strike one free blow,
 Whether for weal or woe;
 Glad to breathe one free breath,
 Though on the lips of death.
 Praying--alas! in vain!--
 That they might fall again,
 So they could once more see
 That burst to liberty!
 This was what "freedom" lent
 To this Black Regiment.
  
 Hundreds on hundreds fell;
 But they are resting well;
 Scourges and shackles strong
 Never shall do them wrong.
  
 Oh, to the living few,
 Soldiers, be just and true!
 Hail them as comrades tried;
 Fight with them side by side;
 Never, in field or tent,
 Scorn the Black Regiment.

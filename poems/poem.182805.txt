Before I got my eye put out - 
I liked as well to see 
As other creatures, that have eyes - 
And know no other way - 

But were it told to me, Today, 
That I might have the Sky 
For mine, I tell you that my Heart 
Would split, for size of me - 

The Meadows - mine - 
The Mountains - mine - 
All Forests - Stintless stars - 
As much of noon, as I could take - 
Between my finite eyes - 

The Motions of the Dipping Birds - 
The Morning's Amber Road - 
For mine - to look at when I liked, 
The news would strike me dead - 

So safer - guess - with just my soul 
Opon the window pane 
Where other creatures put their eyes - 
Incautious - of the Sun -

The lightning struck him and left a scar. 
The wind stopped blowing and the wheat stood up. 
Self-tensed self, who is this I that says I ? 
I had a scar in the shape of  lightning 
That split in half when I opened my mouth. 
The sun  just a circle of  heat in the sky 
Throwing absence in the shape of clouds 
Down on the field. Another life placed 
In the middle of  the life I called my own. 
A lesser god commanded the front: return. 
A little god knocked about in the germ. 
The third person put me outside my own sphere. 
A small god chanting lightning in the synapse. 
Wind blows the wheat down. He calls it prayer.

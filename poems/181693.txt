title : Blue Springs

author : C. Dale Young

text : 
As if the sky during its emergence 
—when it bubbled its way up out of the sand, 
cooled and then sublimed into vapor 
that blued the dank grey of the atmosphere— 
left a residue of cobalt behind to remind 

from where it had sprung into existence, 
the water rising from this spring 
appears unearthly, as only things 
close to earth, born of earth, can:   
its blue deeper than the heart of a sapphire. 

Today, when faced with such a spectacle, 
we have, as usual, only two choices:   
the paralysis of awe, or the quick nonchalance 
of acceptance. But what about the Spaniards   
who came upon this spring before there was 

a platform lined with inner tubes, before 
there were wooden walkways elevated to slow 
their impending rot, before their was a faux beach, 
its sand stolen from the spring’s center? 
Did they run in with their clothes on 

convinced that this was  the fountain of youth? 
Did they laugh believing themselves 
drunk, mad, asleep—dead, maybe? 
That afternoon, late summer, we did not swim, 
chose instead to wander out to the edge 

of the walkway, not a word between the two of us, 
only the wind. Unlike us mere mortals, the trees 
had long since been impressed, 
preferring, instead, to maintain postures 
incompatible with the work of sycophants.

title : A Good Fish

Jerk that bitch, urges my guide,   
and I give my shuddering pole 
a jerk, hooking the throat 
of the first steelhead of my life. 
Reel 'em, he mutters and revs the motor. 
I horse my pole and reel and horse. 
The boat's mascot whines, her claws 
clicking. Let it take some line. 
My father, uncle, and cousin 
are reeling. First fish! they shout, 
and I shout, What a fighter! 
A silver spine touches the air.   
There, he points, a hen. And guess what? 
She's gonna join the club, 
somehow spotting in that glimpse 
the smooth place along her back   
where a fin had been snipped.   
He leans over the gunwale, dips a net, 
and scoops her into the boat.   
She is thick with a wide band   
of fiery scales, slap- 
slapping the aluminum bottom. 
Welcome to the club, he says, 
and clobbers her once, and again, 
and once more before she goes still. 
A bleeder, he says, shaking his head 
and handing her to me. I curl 
a finger through a gill the way 
you're supposed to, determined 
not to let her slip and flop 
back to the river, a blunder 
I'd never live down. A good fist. 
Fish, I mean. A good fish.

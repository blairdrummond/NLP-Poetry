title : Bait Goat

author : Kay Ryan

text : 
There is a 
distance where 
magnets pull, 
we feel, having 
held them   
back. Likewise 
there is a 
distance where 
words attract. 
Set one out 
like a bait goat   
and wait and   
seven others 
will approach. 
But watch out: 
roving packs can 
pull your word 
away. You   
find your stake   
yanked and some   
rough bunch 
to thank.

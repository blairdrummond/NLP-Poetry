"F. . . the oven is an F"  Samantha Foggle, age 3
Oh, to hear the world with such clarity. 
Such surety. To know the note 
of your breakfast chat is B-flat minor. 
That the ’57 Chevy stalled outside the 
garage is a D. To recognize the Apricot 
kitchen paint for what it is: F-sharp. 
To understand the way you feel for him is G, 
definitely a G. And as you watch him 
descend the scale of the front steps to his car 
for work, the house quiets to an A. 
The arpeggio of last night’s Every 
Good Boy Deserves Favor 
still ringing in your ears.

Rhymed Stanza

A child's a plaything for an hour;
      Its pretty tricks we try
For that or for a longer space;
      Then tire, and lay it by.

But I knew one, that to itself
      All seasons could controul;
That would have mock'd the sense of pain
      Out of a grieved soul.

Thou, straggler into loving arms,
      Young climber up of knees,
When I forget thy thousand ways,
      Then life and all shall cease.

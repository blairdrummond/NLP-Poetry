“It seems to me,” said Booker T., 
“It shows a mighty lot of cheek 
To study chemistry and Greek 
When Mister Charlie needs a hand 
To hoe the cotton on his land, 
And when Miss Ann looks for a cook, 
Why stick your nose inside a book?” 

“I don’t agree,” said W.E.B., 
“If I should have the drive to seek 
Knowledge of chemistry or Greek, 
I’ll do it. Charles and Miss can look 
Another place for hand or cook. 
Some men rejoice in skill of hand, 
And some in cultivating land, 
But there are others who maintain 
The right to cultivate the brain.” 

“It seems to me,” said Booker T., 
“That all you folks have missed the boat 
Who shout about the right to vote, 
And spend vain days and sleepless nights 
In uproar over civil rights. 
Just keep your mouths shut, do not grouse, 
But work, and save, and buy a house.” 

“I don’t agree,” said W.E.B., 
“For what can property avail 
If dignity and justice fail. 
Unless you help to make the laws, 
They’ll steal your house with trumped-up clause. 
A rope’s as tight, a fire as hot, 
No matter how much cash you’ve got. 
Speak soft, and try your little plan, 
But as for me, I’ll be a man.” 

“It seems to me,” said Booker T.— 
“I don’t agree,” 
Said W.E.B.

I asked my father, 
“would you rather die 
of cancer or a heart attack? 
Would you rather be executed   
or put in jail for life? 
Which would you rather be— 
a spy or a sentinel?” 
And he tried to answer 
honestly, combing his thinning hair 
with his fingers, thinking of something else.   
At last he fell silent. I ran out 
to savor the dregs of dusk 
playing with my friends 
in the road that led to the highway.   
The ball flew up toward day 
and landed in night. 
We chanted. Every other minute 
a truck, summoned by our warnings,   
brushed past in a gust of light,   
the driver’s curses muffled 
by distance: the oncoming wheels   
were the point of the game, 
like the scores in chalk 
or the blood from scuffed knees   
that we smeared across our faces:   
so when my mother called, 
her voice was quaint and stymied   
and I took all the time in the world   
trotting home past tarped barbecue pits,   
past names of lovers filling with sap,   
past tentative wind from sprinklers: 
then I was stunned to see my golden window   
where all faces, hanging plants, dangling pots   
were framed by night and dwarfed   
by a ravenous inward-turning light.

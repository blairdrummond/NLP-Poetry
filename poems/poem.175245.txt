I Love all Beauteous Things 
Robert Bridges 
1844-1930

England


Rhymed Stanza

I love all beauteous things,
      I seek and adore them;
God hath no better praise,
And man in his hasty days
      Is honoured for them.

I too will something make
      And joy in the making;
Altho' to-morrow it seem
Like the empty words of a dream
      Remembered on waking.

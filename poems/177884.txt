We boys, the neighborhood’s barefoot 
We boys, the neighborhood’s naked 
We boys of stomachs bloated from eating mud 
We boys of teeth porous from eating dates and pumpkin rind 

We boys will line up from Hassan al-Basri’s mausoleum to the Ashar River’s source 
to meet you in the morning waving green palm fronds 

We will cry out: Long Live 
We will cry out: Live to Eternity 
And we will hear the music of Scottish bagpipes, gladly 
Sometimes we will laugh at an Indian soldier’s beard 
but fear will merge with our laughs, and dispute them 

We cry out: Long Live 
We cry out: Live to Eternity 
and reach our hands toward you: Give us bread 
We the hungry, starving since our birth in this village 
Give us meat, chewing gum, cans, and fish 
Give us, so no mother expels her child 
so that we do not eat mud and sleep 

We boys, the neighborhood’s barefoot 
do not know from where you had come 
or why you had come 
or why we cry out: Long Live 
............................... 

And now we ask: will you stay long? 
And will we go on reaching our hands toward you?

title : Winter Journal: The Sky Is the Lost Orpheum

The shelter of it carved, caved 
Across the river, the park and the little Ferris wheel 
       closed down 
The great oaks emptying, russet, gusseted 
the hovering slant light leaking from the outer edge 
       of cloud bed 
leads and shawls pulled forth 
Thy synchrony of the lost elements recovered 
the shivering water surfaces, planar unmeldings, remeldings, 
       riverine alchemies, unlocketed selves 
now the reemergence, the sun pouring global gold 
       uptilted, gobleted, incanted 
Am I not as God made me but stranger? 
Made stranger still by what I have seen 
at this hour of earth untended, unministered— 
light caught up in the river’s grooved tread 
That sun more like a mass grope out of emptiness 
       and the black river weeds before it, torn and trained, 
       rocketed and stark and stuck-to 
The tall shadow of the willow grows forth 
And the spare stems of the grasses and the rods of the mullein 
And these are the stations of this river 
The houses and the boats and the parked cars 
The growing wedge the ducks make moving forward, the shape 
       of the element there among the weeds that jut forward, 
the mass of the willows growing deeper in green and sundering 
The backfall of sun going downward 
The surface of the river coming clear of its own admixture 
The ducks moving over like slow planes in formation, 
       barely seen needles hauling white threads, 
       secretly heeding 
The fish in my skin relinquishes 
Will I know then what I have become? 
The river darkens from its end of trees closing in 
There is the sun and this deep depression 
Exiting as viewed in this river

title : Prayer for My Father

author : Robert Bly

text : 
Your head is still 
restless, rolling 
east and west. 
That body in you 
insisting on living 
is the old hawk 
for whom the world 
darkens. 
If I am not 
with you when you die, 
that is just. 

It is all right. 
That part of you cleaned 
my bones more 
than once. But I 
will meet you 
in the young hawk 
whom I see 
inside both 
you and me; he 
will guide 
you to the Lord of Night, 
who will give you 
the tenderness 
you wanted here.

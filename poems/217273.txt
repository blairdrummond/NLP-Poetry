title : Song of the Sea to the Shore

author : Robert Fanning

text : 
Unraveling velvet, wave after wave, driven   
by wind, unwinding by storm, by gravity thrown—   
however, heaving to reach you, to find you, I've striven   
undulant, erosive, blown—   

or lying flat as glass for your falling clear   
down: I can't swallow you. So why   
have I felt I've reached you—as two reflected stars,   
surfaced, lie near—as if the sky's   

close element is one in me, where starfish   
cleave to stones—if you're so far?   
I've touched you, I know, but my rush         
subsides; our meetings only leave desire's   

fleeting trace. Every place I touch you   
changes shape. Shore, lie down—   
undo. I'll fill your thirsty bones with blue.   
I'll flood your every cave and we'll be one.

Not knowing in what season this again 
Not knowing when again the arms outyearning   
Nor the flung smile in eyes not knowing when

Not sure of time now nor the film’s reversal   
This all done opposite, the waif regathered 

Like our lost parents in the blinded song 
We bag in hand with wandering steps and slow   
Through suburbs take our solitary way 

Not that all clouds are garrisoned and stung   
Not that horizons loom with coppered legions   
Not that the year is dark with weird condition 

All who parted in all days looked back 
Saw the white face, the waving. And saw the sea   
Not knowing in what season this again 

For well they knew, the parters in all evenings   
Druid and Roman and the rocked Phoenician:   
The blood flows one imposed way, and no other

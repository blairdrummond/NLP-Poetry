title : In the Meantime

What seemed a mystery was 
in fact a choice. Insert bird for sorrow.   

What seemed a memory was in fact 
a dividing line. Insert bird for wind.   

Insert wind for departure when everyone is 
standing still. Insert three mountains 

burning and in three valleys a signal seer 
seeing a distant light and a signal bearer 

sprinting to a far-off bell. What seemed 
a promise was in fact a sigh.   

What seemed a hot wind, a not quite enough,   
a forgive me, it has flown away, is in fact.   

In the meantime we paint the floors 
red. We stroke the sound of certain names 

into a fine floss that drifts across our teeth. 
We stay in the room we share and listen 

all night to what drifts through the window— 
dog growl, owl call, a fleet of mosquitoes 

setting sail, and down the road,   
the swish of tomorrow’s donkey-threshed grain.

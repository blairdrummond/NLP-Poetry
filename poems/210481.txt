The social instincts ... naturally lead to the golden rule.  —CHARLES DARWIN, The Descent of Man
1 
Holding her steady, into the pitch and roll,   
in raw Midwestern hands ten thousand tons   
of winter wheat for the fall of Rome, 
still swallowing the hunger of the war:   
the binnacle glows like an open fire, 
east-southeast and steady, 
Anderssen, the Viking mate, 
belaboring me for contraband, 
my little book of Einstein, that 
“Commie Jew.” (So much for the social instincts,   
pacifism, humanism, the frail 
and noble causes.) I speak my piece 
for western civ: light bends ... 
stars warp ... mass converts ... 
“Pipe dreams,” says the Dane, “pipe dreams.” 
“Well, mate, remember, 
those Jewish dreams made nightmares   
out of Hiroshima, and 
blew us out of uniform, alive.” 
He stomps down off the bridge; some day   
he’ll fire me off his rusty 
liberty: I read too much. 
The ocean tugs and wrestles with 
ten thousand deadweight tons 
of charity, trembling on 
degrees and minutes. Anderssen 
steams back in with coffee, to 
contest the stars with Einstein, full ahead.   
We haven’t come to Darwin. 

       2 
Freezing on the flying bridge, 
staring at the night for nothing,   
running lights of freighters lost 
in a blur of blowing snow, 
we hold on through the midnight watch,   
waiting out the bells. 
With Einstein in our wake, the tricks   
are easier: liberty 
churns on, ten knots an hour, 
toward Rome. One starry night 
we ride at last with Darwin on 
the Beagle: endless ocean, sea 
sickness, revelations 
of Toxodon and Megalonyx—a voyage   
old as the Eocene, the watery death   
of Genesis. The going 
gets rough again, the threat of all those bones   
churning the heavy swells: Anderssen,   
a true believer, skeptical, 
and Darwin trapped in a savage earthquake,   
the heave of coastal strata conjuring   
the wreck of England, lofty houses gone,   
government in chaos, 
violence and pillage through the land,   
and afterward, 
fossils gleaming white along 
the raw ridges. 
“Limeys.” Anderssen puts his benediction   
to empire: “Stupid Limeys.” After that 
we breathe a bit and watch the stars and tell   
sad stories of the death of tribes, the bones,   
the countless bones: we talk about   
the war, we talk about 
extinction. 

       3 
Okinawa, Iwo Jima: 
slouching toward Tokyo, the only good Jap   
is a dead Jap. 
We must get the bomb, Einstein writes   
to F.D.R., waking from 
the dreams of peace, the noble causes:   
get it first, before 
the Nazis do. (The only good Nazi   
is an extinct Nazi.) 
At the death of Hiroshima, all day long   
we celebrate extinction, chugalugging   
free beer down at the px, teen- 
age kids in khaki puking pints 
of three-point-two in honor 
of the fire: no more island-hopping now   
to the murderous heart of empire.   
Later, in the luxury of peace, 
the bad dreams come. “Certainly,”   
Darwin broods, “no fact 
in the long history of the world 
is so startling as the wide and repeated   
extermination 
of its inhabitants.” 

       4 
Off somewhere to starboard, the Canaries,   
Palma, Tenerife: sunrise 
backlights the rugged peaks, as Darwin,   
twenty-two years old, gazes at   
the clouds along the foothills.   
Longitudes ease westward; it’s   
my birthday: twenty-two years old   
as Tenerife falls into the sunset,   
I’m as greedy for the old world 
as Darwin for the new, Bahia, Desire,   
the palms and crimson flowers   
of the Mediterranean, clear water   
dancing with mines. Ahead of us   
a tanker burns; the war 
will never end.

“You talk a lot,” says the melancholy Dane. 
“You sure you’re not Jewish yourself? 
You got a funny name.” 
“Well, mate, I’m pure Celtic on one side, 
pure Orphan on the other: therefore half 
of anything at all—Jewish, Danish, 
what you will: a problem, isn’t it,   
for Hitler, say, or the Klan, 
or even Gregor Mendel, sweating out the summer   
in his pea patch?” 
The fact is, I know those ancestors 
floating through my sleep: 
an animal that breathed water,   
had a great swimming tail, 
an imperfect skull, undoubtedly   
hermaphrodite ... I slide 
through all the oceans with these kin,   
salt water pulsing in my veins,   
and aeons follow me into the trees: 
a hairy, tailed quadruped, 
arboreal in its habits, scales 
slipping off my flanks, the angle of my spine   
thrust upward, brain 
bulging the skull until 
I ride the Beagle 
down the eastern trades to earthquake,   
to naked cannibals munching red meat 
and Spanish grandees with seven names 
crushing the fingers of slaves. 
Who are my fathers? mothers? who 
will I ever father? 
I will sire the one in my rubber sea-boots, who   
has sailed the seas and come 
to the bones of Megatherium. 
From the war of nature, from famine and death,   
we stand at last creators 
of ourselves: “The greatest 
human satisfaction,” Darwin muses, “is derived   
from following the social instincts.” Well,   
the thing I want to father 
is the rarest, most difficult thing 
in any nature: I want to be, 
knee-deep in these rivers of innocent blood,   
a decent animal. 

       6 
Landfall: Yankee liberty discharges   
calories on the docks, where kids   
with fingers formed by hairy   
quadrupeds cross 
mumbo jumbo on their chests   
and rub small signs for hope   
and charity. 
Liberty, sucked empty of its 
social instincts, follows the Beagle  
down the empty avenues of water   
to amber waves of grain, to feed   
the children of our fathers’ wars,   
new generations of orphans, lives   
our quaint old-fashioned bombs   
had not quite ended. 

       7 
Alone 
on the fantail 
I hear the grind of rigging, and 
Darwin is beside me, leaning on the rail,   
watching the wake go phosphorescent.   
We’ve been out five years, have seen   
the coral islands, the dark skins 
of Tahiti; I have questions. 
“Darwin,” I whisper, “tell me now, 
have you entered into the springs of the sea,   
or have you walked in search of the depth?   
Did you give the gorgeous wings to peacocks,   
or feathers to the ostrich? 
Have you given the horse his strength   
and clothed his neck with thunder? 
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts,   
and given understanding to the heart?   
Answer me.” 
The breeze is making eddies in the mist, 
and out of those small whirlwinds come the words:   
“I have walked along the bottom of the sea   
wrenched into the clouds at Valparaiso;   
I have seen the birth of islands and 
the build of continents; I 
know the rise and fall of mountain ranges,   
I understand the wings of pigeons, 
peacock feathers, finches; my mind creates   
general laws out of large 
collections of facts.” 
The rigging sighs a little: God 
is slipping away without 
saying goodbye, goodbye to Jewish dreams.   
“But the activities of the mind,” 
Darwin murmurs, “are one of the bases of conscience.” 
Astern the pious Spaniards go on praying 
and crushing the fingers of slaves; somewhere   
the Mylodon wanders away, 
out of the animal kingdom and 
into the empire of death. 
For five billion years 
we have seen the past, and 
it works. 

       8 
So this is the final convoy 
of the social instincts: the next   
time missiles fly to Rome, 
they will carry Einstein’s dream of fire,   
and afterward there will be no need   
for liberties, hope, or charity.   
Now we ride the oceans of   
imagination, all horizon 
and no port. Darwin 
will soon be home, his five-year   
voyage on this little brig 
all over; but when will I 
be home, when will I arrive 
at that special creation: a decent animal? 
The land is failing the horizons, and   
we only know to take the wheel 
and test the ancient strength of human struggle,   
remembering that we ourselves, the wonder 
and glory of the universe, bear 
in our lordly bones the indelible stamp   
of our lowly 
origin.

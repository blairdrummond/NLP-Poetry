Under the trellised arbor, and our supper’s over   
in the memory I’ve found myself inside. 

L not speaking, and beside us the river   
sliding softly by. Now the light will fade 

to moonlit water. And in memory I work   
to make this lingering accurate and sweet. 

White ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes,   
first to her lips, then to mine. I may as well speak 

to moonlight as to her. And the walls of Bruges   
light up again, a costume jewelry pearl string. 

Her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze   
in memory’s flammable celluloid—flaring 

and gone, replaced by bread and grapes, a checkered   
tablecloth. The two chairs stare each other down, 

empty now, upon which moonlight flickered 
all night. The bread and grapes drip mist as dawn 

carves the morning with a chilly wind, 
slicing away both moon and fog. Now someone 

without a name appears—first the fevered hands,   
Dustdevil quick, that grope for the food in vain. 

Then the pale light shows the open mouth   
and rippling throat, white face on black water, 

sparrow-flock fast, its spiraling path. 
But the bread and grapes stay where they were, 

their smell tormenting that famished ghost, helpless   
to even lick away the dew that gathers 

on the grapes, blue fluted sides of the wineglasses.   
Dawnlight, everything dripping wet, and the chairs 

stare at each other, alone. Sometimes on the riverbank   
you can sense an odor—of grapes, or sex, or memory. 

It swirls through the moonlit grass. And now wakes   
someone always mute, someone without a body 

weaving also through the half-lit grass. 
The hoarse wail of someone who cannot speak, 

who reaches out but cannot touch the grass, 
and only the nostrils flare. Now the dawn will break, 

late autumn cold. To crave so endlessly the warmth— 
the blood-pulsing fingertip, the body to embrace, 

the pungent smells commingling. To rise like breath   
and slither through the trees and tangle every branch 

in this unappeasable longing, this endless lust   
for touch and smell which afflicts the dead. 

The souls in the trees face the gathering light.   
Other times, in the ground, the rain torments them.

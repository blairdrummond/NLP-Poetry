text : 
Scarred hemlock roots, 
Oaks in mail, and willow-shoots 
    Spring’s first-knighted; 
Clinging aspens grouped between, 
Slender, misty-green, 
    Faintly affrighted: 

Far hills behind, 
Somber growth, with sunlight lined, 
    On their edges; 
Banks hemmed in with maiden-hair, 
And the straight and fair 
    Phalanx of sedges: 

Wee wings and eyes, 
Wild blue gemmy dragon-flies, 
    Fearless rangers; 
Drowsy turtles in a tribe 
Diving, with a gibe 
    Muttered at strangers; 

Wren, bobolink, 
Robin, at the grassy brink; 
    Great frogs jesting; 
And the beetle, for no grief 
Half-across his leaf 
    Sighing and resting; 

In the keel’s way, 
Unwithdrawing bream at play, 
    Till from branches 
Chestnut-blossoms, loosed aloft, 
Graze them with their soft 
    Full avalanches! 

This is very odd! 
Boldly sings the river-god: 
    ‘Pilgrim rowing! 
From the Hyperborean air 
Wherefore, and O where 
    Should man be going?’ 

Slave to a dream, 
Me no urgings and no theme 
    Can embolden; 
Now no more the oars swing back, 
Drip, dip, till black 
    Waters froth golden. 

Musketaquid! 
I have loved thee, all unbid, 
    Earliest, longest; 
Thou hast taught me thine own thrift: 
Here I sit, and drift 
    Where the wind’s strongest. 

If, furthermore, 
There be any pact ashore, 
    I forget it! 
If, upon a busy day 
Beauty make delay, 
    Once over, let it! 

Only, — despite 
Thee, who wouldst unnerve me quite 
    Like a craven,— 
Best the current be not so, 
Heart and I must row 
    Into our haven!

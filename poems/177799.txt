title : The Other Side of This World

author : Calvin Forbes

text : 
Put my glad rags in a cardboard box— 
This old jiggerboo never grew mature. 
Is everthing in its place except me? 
Don’t be surprised; I called all day 

And the only person I could reach was 
The operator; and it’s a sorry day when 
Nothing is coming down but your foot. 
And how deep is your stomach cause 

That’s how far your heart will fall! 
When I’m gone I might come back cause 
I’m always forgetting something special. 
A crease in my overalls, my collar stiff, 

I cried as many tears as I have teeth. 
And I only got two in my mouth. Son of the 
Sun look out: as you get black you burn.
Is everything in its place except me?

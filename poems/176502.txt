Am I the only one 
                           watching   
my neighbour’s 
                      frolicksome goat, 
Ginger, 
            tied to a pecan tree?   
All morning 
                  it has been examining 
an empty bushel basket 
                                  and has lifted 
one leg delicately 
                            like a circus horse 
as if to roll it, 
                           but whether to do that 
or to butt it 
                     with its small horns, 
that is the question. 
                                 Not of great moment, 
no signing of the Charter, 
                                        but like air music,   
quickest of the elements. 
                                       Towards which I leaped! 

In form 
            its own grace,   
appearing, 
                as it passed   
in retrospect, classical. 

The real goat stayed, 
                                 imperturbable,   
the body solid 
                      as a four-square loom   
and delivered me 
                         from abstraction.   
His coloring, 
                     greyish-soft shades, 
their dark and light 
                        passing into each other   
as in an antique rubbing. 

I now found myself 
                            sitting so near, 
my shade, 
               as in the Inferno, 
sensed his, 
                  but he gave no sign 
of my presence, 
                        even when I stroked him   
and my heart leaped 
                              at the gentle fleece,   
too fine for a hard life. 
He continued nibbling 
                                 on a dry bush. 

I would not have believed 
                                       unconcern 
could bolster the man in me 
                                          and be so enduring.   
Sic transit, not caring 
                                    whether it is recognized,   
The Divine 
                (from another age). 

He was poking 
                     into the underbush now 
and reached across my head 
                                        for the small spiny twigs. 

At that the phase 
                           changed 
and a sensuous trembling 
                                     hung in the air,   
as when a bee is about 
                                  to descend 
on blossoming clover, 
                                 and I 
felt myself being pulled 
                                     as by a line   
from the invisible 
                            other side 
to enter goathood, 
                            deeper than sight.

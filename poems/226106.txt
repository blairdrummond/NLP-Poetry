title : Unholy Sonnet 13

author : Mark Jarman

text : 
Drunk on the Umbrian hills at dusk and drunk   
On one pink cloud that stood beside the moon,   
Drunk on the moon, a marble smile, and drunk,   
Two young Americans, on one another,   
Far from home and wanting this forever— 
Who needed God? We had our bodies, bread,   
And glasses of a raw, green, local wine, 
And watched our Godless perfect darkness breed   
Enormous softly burning ancient stars. 
Who needed God? And why do I ask now?   
Because I’m older and I think God stirs 
In details that keep bringing back that time,   
Details that are just as vivid now— 
Our bodies, bread, a sharp Umbrian wine.

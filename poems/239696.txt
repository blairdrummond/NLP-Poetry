title : Rain

text : 
Toward evening, as the light failed 
and the pear tree at my window darkened, 
I put down my book and stood at the open door, 
the first raindrops gusting in the eaves, 
a smell of wet clay in the wind. 
Sixty years ago, lying beside my father, 
half asleep, on a bed of pine boughs as rain 
drummed against our tent, I heard 
for the first time a loon’s sudden wail 
drifting across that remote lake— 
a loneliness like no other, 
though what I heard as inconsolable 
may have been only the sound of something 
untamed and nameless 
singing itself to the wilderness around it 
and to us until we slept. And thinking of my father 
and of good companions gone 
into oblivion, I heard the steady sound of rain 
and the soft lapping of water, and did not know 
whether it was grief or joy or something other 
that surged against my heart 
and held me listening there so long and late.

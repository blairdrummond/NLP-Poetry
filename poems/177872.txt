text : 
Out of a high meadow where flowers   
bloom above cloud, come down; 
pursue me with reasons for smiling without malice. 

Bring mimic pride like that of the seedling fir,   
surprise in the perfect leg-stems 
and queries unstirred by recognition or fear   
pooled in the deep eyes. 

Come down by regions where rocks   
lift through the hot haze of pain;   
down landscapes darkened, crossed   
by the rift of death-shock; place print   
of a neat hoof on trampled ground   
where not one leaf or root 
remains unbitten; but come down   
always, accompany me to the morass   
of the decaying mind. There 
we’ll share one rotted stump between us.

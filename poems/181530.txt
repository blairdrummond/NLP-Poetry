title : The Hills in Half Light

text : 
Or will we be lost forever? 

In the silence of the last breath 
Not taken 

The blue sweep of your arm like a dancer 
Clowning, in wrinkled pajamas, 

Across the sky the abrupt 
Brief zigzag of a jay... 

All night the whiteness 
And all day. 

Once we have been lifted up 
Into empty morning like ice 

In the darkness of these white fields 

Neither the ghost tracks of skis 
Nor steel skates will wake us 

Where are we looking for each other, separated 

On the opposite hillside I see you 
Miles away from me, a dot 

Of faint color reddening, small bruised warmth 
Opening its cranberry mouth and saying, 

What are you saying? 

                                        * 

Under a cold blanket 

An immense loneliness stretches 
In every direction with no fences. 

A few sticks tweak the crusted snow: 

Thin remnants of an army 
Of lost soldiers. 

I see footsteps ahead of me but whose 

And where will they lead me, parallel 
Or converging? Is it not possible there will be one jet trail 

That will not vanish, 

Two phantom ribbons unfolding 
That will not feather themselves away? 

                                       * 

Wrapped in our white parkas 

In what shifting laminations, snowflakes 
That mean nothing, transparent eyes spitting, 

What glacier will we choose to lie on, 
In what igloo rest 

Barely breathing, in an air pocket 
Just below the surface 

Rustling beneath blizzards 

Where is your foot, most beautiful 
With blue toenails 

I will be looking for it always 

Wherever it is, next to me 
In the darkness 

Of rumpled white sheets, 
Pale siftings, clouds 

Sudden scarves of ourselves gusting 
Loose, sandpapery as snow lifting 

In what chill citadel of ice crystals 
Will I find you?

title : How to Enter a Big City

I 

Swing by starwhite bones and 
Lights tick in the middle. 
Blue and white steel 
Black and white 
People hurrying along the wall.   
”Here you are, bury my dead bones.“ 

Curve behind the sun again   
Towers full of ice. Rich   
Glass houses, “Here, 
Have a little of my blood,”   
Rich people!” 

Wheat in towers. Meat on ice. 
Cattlecars. Miles of wide-open walls.   
Baseball between these sudden tracks.   
Yell past the red street— 
Have you any water to drink, City?   
Rich glass buildings, give us milk!   
Give us coffee! Give us rum! 

There are huge clouds all over the sky. 
River smells of gasoline. 
Cars after cars after cars, and then 
A little yellow street goes by without a murmur. 

There came a man 
(”Those are radios, that were his eyes“)   
Who offered to sell us his bones. 

Swing by starwhite buildings and   
Lights come to life with a sound   
Of bugs under the dead rib. 

Miles of it. Still the same city.   


II 

Do you know where you are going?   
Do you know whom you must meet? 

Fortune, perhaps, or good news   
Or the doctor, or the ladies   
In the long bookstore, 
The angry man in the milkbar   
The drunkard under the clock.   
Fortune, perhaps, or wonder   
Or, perhaps, death. 

In any case, our tracks 
Are aimed at a working horizon. 
The buildings, turning twice about the sun,   
Settle in their respective positions. 
Centered in its own incurable discontent, the City   
Consents to be recognized. 


III 

Then people come out into the light of afternoon,   
Covered all over with black powder, 
And begin to attack one another with statements   
Or to ignore one another with horror. 
Customs have not changed. 
Young men full of coffee and 
Old women with medicine under their skin 
Are all approaching death at twenty miles an hour. 

Everywhere there is optimism without love 
And pessimism without understanding, 
They who have new clothes, and smell of haircuts   
Cannot agree to be at peace 
With their own images, shadowing them in windows   
From store to store. 


IV 

Until the lights come on with a swagger of frauds   
And savage ferns, 
The brown-eyed daughters of ravens, 
Sing in the lucky doors 
While night comes down the street like the millennium   
Wrapping the houses in dark feathers 
Soothing the town with a sign 
Healing the strong wings of sunstroke. 
Then the wind of an easy river wipes the flies 
Off my Kentucky collarbone. 

The claws of the treacherous stars   
Renegade drums of wood 
Endure the heavenward protest.   
Their music heaves and hides.   
Rain and foam and oil 
Make sabbaths for our wounds.   
(Come, come, let all come home!) 
The summer sighs, and runs. 
My broken bird is under the whole town,   
My cross is for the gypsies I am leaving   
And there are real fountains under the floor. 


V 

Branches baptize our faces with silver 
Where the sweet silent avenue escapes into the hills.   
Winds at last possess our empty country 
There, there under the moon   
In parabolas of milk and iron   
The ghosts of historical men   
(Figures of sorrow and dust) 
Weep along the hills like turpentine.   
And seas of flowering tobacco 
Surround the drowning sons of Daniel Boone.

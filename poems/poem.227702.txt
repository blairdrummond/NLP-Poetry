Sonnet

As a dare-gale skylark scanted in a dull cage, 
    Man's mounting spirit in his bone-house, mean house, dwells -- 
    That bird beyond the remembering his free fells; 
This in drudgery, day-labouring-out life's age. 
Though aloft on turf or perch or poor low stage 
    Both sing sometimes the sweetest, sweetest spells, 
    Yet both droop deadly sometimes in their cells 
Or wring their barriers in bursts of fear or rage. 

Not that the sweet-fowl, song-fowl, needs no rest -- 
Why, hear him, hear him babble & drop down to his nest, 
    But his own nest, wild nest, no prison. 

Man's spirit will be flesh-bound, when found at best, 
But uncumbered: meadow-down is not distressed 
    For a rainbow footing it nor he for his bones risen.

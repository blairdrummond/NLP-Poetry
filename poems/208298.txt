title : A Posthumous Poetics

author : Michael Ryan

text : 
From embarrassment, I made statements. 
My icons—tight caves and mouths—stuck together   
briefly like dry lips, like a lover’s insults. 
The fact is they were ugly to all of us. 
I said, How painstakingly personal! 
Here are the words for this, 
Relentless as insects! I was hysterical. 

Every tone became artful, 
the worst urges nuzzling like housepets 
for someone to feel them, each real subject   
demanding more real context for remarks.   
Then abstractions insinuating their sharp edges,   
asking to pry open privacies 
alone in the bathroom at bedtime 
then with strangers in elevators, at stop signs.   
Even then, I knew you’d shun them, 
because who would choose such intrusions? 

I learned to love this isolation 
as a woman who appears to listen.   
All night I’d talk about my life   
anticipating her dramatic relief, 
believing her affectionate gestures filled in   
what wasn’t spoken. At those times   
she seemed so genuine and friendly,   
a voice from inside my own body   
describing my shameless surrender   
as our first kiss, perfect as gravity.

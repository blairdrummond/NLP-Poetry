title : For My Daughter

author : Weldon Kees

text : 
Looking into my daughter’s eyes I read   
Beneath the innocence of morning flesh   
Concealed, hintings of death she does not heed. 
Coldest of winds have blown this hair, and mesh 
Of seaweed snarled these miniatures of hands; 
The night’s slow poison, tolerant and bland, 
Has moved her blood. Parched years that I have seen   
That may be hers appear: foul, lingering   
Death in certain war, the slim legs green.   
Or, fed on hate, she relishes the sting   
Of others’ agony; perhaps the cruel   
Bride of a syphilitic or a fool.   
These speculations sour in the sun.   
I have no daughter. I desire none.

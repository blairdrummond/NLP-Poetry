text : 
Lady, take care; for in the diamond eyes   
Of old old men is figured your undoing;   
Love is turned in behind the wrinkled lids 
To nurse their fear and scorn at their near going.   
Flesh hangs like the curtains in a house   
Long unused, damp as cellars without wine;   
They are the future of us all, when we   
Will be dried-leaf-thin, the sour whine   
Of a siren’s diminuendo. They have no past   
But egg husks shattered to a rubbish heap   
By memory’s looting. Do not follow them   
To their camp pitched in a cranny, do not keep   
To the road for them, a weary weary yard   
Will bring you in; that beckoning host ahead,   
Inn-keeper Death, has but to lift his hat   
To topple the oldster in the dust. Read,   
Poor old man, the sensual moral; sleep   
Narrow in your bed, wear no 
More so bright a rose in your lapel; 
The spell of the world is loosed, it is time to go.

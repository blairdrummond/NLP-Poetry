Someone has left us now 
before we have even touched hands. 

Getting lost in the pity of it 
sweeps you into an unknown stretch 
of canyon where oars thud 
against rock and rip free, you clutch 
at help, and even though   
you save yourself, the river   
funnels through the gorge   
and roars, roars, roars. 
Regret, a backwash of pain,   
one lost life swirls down rapids,   
rushes away, out of reach. 

It’s not forgetting that you want —   
it would be easy to drop 
one shoulder and dive, to come up   
gasping in a car on the way to work   
or blue in the face over the dishpan   
staring for who knows how long 
at a cup scoured clean under the suds.   
And not remembering. 

But the absence that is born 
must live as long as a man or a woman.   
There: it comes invisible headfirst, 
a bloodstreaked nothing, and is flushed away.   
While in the white room the dry light   
is cold; and waiting to be taken home   
mute ghosts lie in a row of empty cribs.

title : Walking the Dunes

text : 
In movies when the hero is about to die,   
He scatters a few phrases in a place like this,   
Hoping the words will come up again 
Immortal, or the grasses will reach out for him   
As now they do for us. 

Someone has planted a row of little trees   
To stop the wind. Instead they’ve learned   
To bend like the elect 
In one direction only; they know 
The sea will shatter them. 

Isn’t it always like this? 
Something uncontrollable becomes the hero,   
Taking off its dress, the ice plants 
Sunburn from the center out 
So we can see that their deaths 

Of splendid rust and yellow are not ours, 
We are allowed again the glare 
Of the sand, the druid hills, 
The grasses brushing the legs, though 
Just to have felt it once would have been enough.

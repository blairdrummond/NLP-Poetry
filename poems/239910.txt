title : Magnitudes

author : Howard Nemerov

text : 
Earth’s Wrath at our assaults is slow to come
 But relentless when it does. It has to do
 With catastrophic change, and with the limit
 At which one order more of Magnitude
 Will bring us to a qualitative change
 And disasters drastically different
 From those we daily have to know about. 
  
 As with the speed of light, where speed itself
 Becomes a limit and an absolute;
 As with the splitting of the atom
 And a little later of the nucleus;
 As with the millions rising into billions—
 The piker’s kind in terms of money, yes,
 But a million2 in terms of time and space
 As the universe grew vast while the earth
 Our habitat diminished to the size
 Of a billiard ball, both relative
 To the cosmos and to the numbers of ourselves,
 The doubling numbers, the earth could accommodate.
  
 We stand now in the place and limit of time
 Where hardest knowledge is turning into dream,
 And nightmares still contained in sleeping dark
 Seem on the point of bringing into day
 The sweating panic that starts the sleeper up.
 One or another nightmare may come true,
 And what to do then? What in the world to do?

   might have been.
 Certainly these ashes might have been pleasures.
 Pilgrims on their way to the Holy Places remark
 this place. Isn’t it plain to all
 that these mounds were palaces? This was once
 a city among men, a gathering together of spirit.
 It was measured by the Lord and found wanting.
  
 It was measured by the Lord and found wanting,
 destroyd by the angels that inhabit longing.
 Surely this is Great Sodom where such cries
 as if men were birds flying up from the swamp
 ring in our ears, where such fears that were once
 desires walk, almost spectacular,
 stalking the desolate circles, red eyed.
  
 This place rumord to have been a City surely was,
 separated from us by the hand of the Lord.
 The devout have laid out gardens in the desert,
 drawn water from springs where the light was blighted.
 How tenderly they must attend these friendships
 or all is lost. All is lost.
 Only the faithful hold this place green.
  
 Only the faithful hold this place green
 where the crown of fiery thorns descends.
 Men that once lusted grow listless. A spirit
 wrappd in a cloud, ashes more than ashes,
 fire more than fire, ascends.
 Only these new friends gather joyous here,
 where the world like Great Sodom lies under fear.
  
 The world like Great Sodom lies under Love
 and knows not the hand of the Lord that moves.
 This the friends teach where such cries
 as if men were birds fly up from the crowds
 gatherd and howling in the heat of the sun.
 In the Lord Whom the friends have named at last Love
 the images and loves of the friends never die.
 This place rumord to have been Sodom is blessd
 in the Lord’s eyes.

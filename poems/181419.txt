title : A Negative of Snow

Ice on the puddles, 
in the cups of fallen leaves. 
I’d walk with Dad and a handful 
of other men, the setters working 
the fields, the underbrush. 
It was my job to carry the birds. 
I’d have them all plucked 
by the time we got back to the car. 
On the walk out I’d look 
for puddles I’d missed 
and break them. 

Though many moonless nights 
have fallen on the grave 
like a negative of snow, 
Dad’s wheelchair sometimes 
flashes in my mind, and I hear 
the bleating down the hall, 
a voice berating its god, 
his worthless anodynes, 
and the doctors who were 
at that very moment 
increasing his morphine, 
having failed to note 
the word alcoholic on his chart, 
meaning that his damaged liver 
routed the opiates straight 
to his brain, his beautiful fragile brain, 
which I had not yet finished loving. 
My father, who still had manners, 
who was a hardwood, a tough tree. 
That was his first death.

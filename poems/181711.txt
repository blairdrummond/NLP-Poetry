title : A Duet

author : Kevin McFadden

text : 
Art was long. 
Paul was short. 
Art sang the song. 
Paul was the sort 

who made one up 
as if from air. 
Paul had more gift. 
Art had more hair— 

which isn’t to take 
away from Arts. 
Many sing well 
if someone starts, 

and it robs no Simon 
to get paid like Paul. 
Along was Art’s way 
to be singing at all. 

If Paul robbed some, 
it’s harder revealing. 
What stuck in his mind, 
he stuck to concealing 

so koo-koo-ka-choo 
would stick in our heads. 
It wasn’t Garfunkel, 
someone said Simon said 

when they parted acts. 
Debts one forgets. 
Acoustic is fraught 
with strings over frets, 

taken together, 
taken apart. 
Paul lifting from life.   
Life lifting from Art.

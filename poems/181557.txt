title : In These Soft Trinities

Whenever I see two women 
       crowned, constellated friends 

it is as if three birch trees wept together 
       in a field by a constant spring. 

               The third woman isn’t there 

exactly, but just before them a flame 
       bursts out, then disappears 

in a blurred, electric shining 
       that lifts my hair like an animal’s. 

In an aura of charged air I remember 
         my poor mother turned into royalty, 
               my sister and me in bobby socks 

endlessly, all summer long 
       calling each other Margaret Rose 

and Lillibet, Lillibet, Lillibet, 
       pretending to be princesses... 

Now, swollen into these tall blooms 
       like paper cutouts in water, 

in each new neighborhood garden 
         always, two women talking 

nod their three curly heads together: 
       with bits of dirt on their foreheads, speckled 
               iris, flaming poppy 

in the backyard dynasties of the multiflora 
         it is the famous funeral photograph 
               of the Dowager Queen, Queen Mother, stunned Young Queen, 

three stepping stones in marble 
         that haunt me forever, clear 
                and mysterious as well water, the weight of it 

in a bronze bucket swinging 
                  powerfully from my hand. 

As the plumcolored shadow rises, 
          full as a first child in the orchard, 

the lost gardening glove on the path, 
                   the single earring tucked 

       in an odd corner of the purse and then found 

here double themselves, then triple: 
         in these soft trinities 
                  the lives that begin in us 

are born and born again like wings. 
       Secret as doves scuffling 

in the wide envelope of wombs 
                like loose, comfortable aprons flung 

over the heads of friends leaning together 
       in the hum of earth’s plainsong 

like a three part round, 
       like a single voice murmuring 
                      the dream never leaves us, of the self 

like a three masted vessel still voyaging: 
            out of the long matrix of memory, 
                     the royal bulbs in the hold, 

the ballast that keeps us upright, loyal 
                to the dark, deep-bedded throne 
       of the old country each new soul claims as its own.

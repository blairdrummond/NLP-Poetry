Couplet

I would my soul were like the bird   
That dares the vastness undeterred.   
Look, where the bluebird on the bough   
Breaks into rapture even now!   
He sings, tip-top, the tossing elm   
As tho he would a world o'erwhelm.   
Indifferent to the void he rides   
Upon the wind's eternal tides. 

He tosses gladly on the gale, 
For well he knows he can not fail-- 
Knows if the bough breaks, still his wings   
Will bear him upward while he sings!

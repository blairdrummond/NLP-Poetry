Blank Verse, Epic

DEscend from Heav'n Urania, by that name 
If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine 
Following, above th' Olympian Hill I soare, 
Above the flight of Pegasean wing. 
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou 
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top 
Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne, 
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd, 
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, 
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play 
In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd 
With thy Celestial Song.   Up led by thee 
Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd, 
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, 
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down 
Return me to my Native Element: 
Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once 
Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) 
Dismounted, on th' Aleian Field I fall 
Erroneous there to wander and forlorne. 
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound 
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; 
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, 
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd 
To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes, 
On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues; 
In darkness, and with dangers compast round, 
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou 
Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn 
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, 
Urania, and fit audience find, though few. 
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance 
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race 
Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard 
In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares 
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround 
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend 
Her Son.   So fail not thou, who thee implores: 
For thou are Heav'nlie, shee an emptie dreame. 

Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael, 
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn'd 
Adam by dire example to beware 
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven 
To those Apostates, least the like befall 
In Paradise to Adam or his Race, 
Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree, 
If they transgress, and slight that sole command, 
So easily obeyd amid the choice 
Of all tastes else to please thir appetite, 
Though wandring.   He with his consorted Eve 
The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd 
With admiration, and deep Muse to hear 
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought 
So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n, 
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss 
With such confusion: but the evil soon 
Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those 
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix 
With Blessedness.   Whence Adam soon repeal'd 
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now 
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know 
What neerer might concern him, how this World 
Of Heav'n and Earth conspicious first began, 
When, and whereof created, for what cause, 
What within Eden or without was done 
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth 
Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, 
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, 
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. 

Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, 
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd 
Divine interpreter, by favour sent 
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne 
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, 
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: 
For which to the infinitly Good we owe 
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment 
Receave with solemne purpose to observe 
Immutably his sovran will, the end 
Of what we are.   But since thou hast voutsaf't 
Gently for our instruction to impart 
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd 
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, 
Deign to descend now lower, and relate 
What may no less perhaps availe us known, 
How first began this Heav'n which we behold 
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd 
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills 
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd 
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause 
Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest 
Through all Eternitie so late to build 
In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon 
Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould 
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske 
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more 
To magnifie his works, the more we know. 
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run 
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n 
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, 
And longer will delay to heare thee tell 
His Generation, and the rising Birth 
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: 
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon 
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring 
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, 
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song 
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. 

Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: 

And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. 
This also thy request with caution askt 
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works 
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, 
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? 
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve 
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr 
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld 
Thy hearing, such Commission from above 
I have receav'd, to answer thy desire 
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain 
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope 
Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, 
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, 
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: 
Anough is left besides to search and know. 
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less 
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know 
In measure what the mind may well contain, 
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns 
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. 

Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n 
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host 
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) 
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep 
Into his place, and the great Son returnd 
Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent 
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld 
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. 

At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought 
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid 
This inaccessible high strength, the seat 
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, 
He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud 
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; 
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, 
Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines 
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes 
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent 
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: 
But least his heart exalt him in the harme 
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n 
My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire 
That detriment, if such it be to lose 
Self-lost, and in a moment will create 
Another World, out of one man a Race 
Of men innumerable, there to dwell, 
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd 
They open to themselves at length the way 
Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, 
And Earth be chang'd to Heav'n, & Heav'n to Earth, 
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. 
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, 
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee 
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: 
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee 
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep 
Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, 
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill 
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. 
Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, 
And put not forth my goodness, which is free 
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance 
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. 

So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake 
His Word, the filial Godhead, gave effect. 
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift 
Then time or motion, but to human ears 
Cannot without process of speech be told, 
So told as earthly notion can receave. 
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n 
When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; 
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will 
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: 
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire 
Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight 
And th' habitations of the just; to him 
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd 
Good out of evil to create, in stead 
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring 
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse 
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. 
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son 
On his great Expedition now appeer'd, 
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd 
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love 
Immense, and all his Father in him shon. 
About his Chariot numberless were pour'd 
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, 
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, 
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old 
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd 
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, 
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth 
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, 
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide 
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound 
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth 
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word 
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. 
On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore 
They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss 
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, 
Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes 
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault 
Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. 

Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, 
Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: 
Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim 
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode 
Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; 
For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine 
Follow'd in bright procession to behold 
Creation, and the wonders of his might. 
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand 
He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd 
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe 
This Universe, and all created things: 
One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd 
Round through the vast profunditie obscure, 
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, 
This be thy just Circumference, O World. 
Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, 
Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound 
Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme 
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, 
And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth 
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd 
The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs 
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd 
Like things to like, the rest to several place 
Disparted, and between spun out the Air, 
And Earth self ballanc't on her Center hung. 

Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light 
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure 
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East 
To journie through the airie gloom began, 
Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun 
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle 
Sojourn'd the while.   God saw the Light was good; 
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere 
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night 
He nam'd.   Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: 
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung 
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light 
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; 
Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout 
The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, 
And touch't thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais'd 
God and his works, Creatour him they sung, 
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. 

Again, God said, let ther be Firmament 
Amid the Waters, and let it divide 
The Waters from the Waters: and God made 
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, 
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd 
In circuit to the uttermost convex 
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, 
The Waters underneath from those above 
Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World 
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide 
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule 
Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames 
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: 
And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n 
And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. 

The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet 
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, 
Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth 
Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme 
Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, 
Fermented the great Mother to conceave, 
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said 
Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n 
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. 
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer 
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave 
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: 
So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low 
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, 
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they 
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld 
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; 
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, 
For haste; such flight the great command impress'd 
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call 
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) 
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, 
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, 
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, 
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, 
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide 
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, 
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; 
Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, 
All but within those banks, where Rivers now 
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. 
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle 
Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: 
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth 
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed, 
And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind; 
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. 
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then 
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, 
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad 
Her Universal Face with pleasant green, 
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd 
Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay 
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, 
Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept 
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed 
Embattell'd in her field: and the humble Shrub, 
And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last 
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred 
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd 
Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, 
With tufts the vallies and each fountain side, 
With borders long the Rivers.   That Earth now 
Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, 
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt 
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd 
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground 
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist 
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each 
Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth 
God made, and every Herb, before it grew 
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good. 
So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. 

Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights 
High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide 
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, 
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, 
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine 
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n 
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. 
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use 
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, 
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, 
And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n 
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day 
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, 
And Light from Darkness to divide.   God saw, 
Surveying his great Work, that it was good: 
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun 
A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, 
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon 
Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs, 
And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: 
Of Light by farr the greater part he took, 
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd 
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive 
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine 
Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. 
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs 
Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, 
And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns; 
By tincture or reflection they augment 
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight 
So farr remote, with diminution seen. 
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, 
Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round 
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run 
His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray 
Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd 
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, 
But opposite in leveld West was set 
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light 
From him, for other light she needed none 
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes 
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, 
Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign 
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, 
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd 
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd 
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, 
Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. 

And God said, let the Waters generate 
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: 
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings 
Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. 
And God created the great Whales, and each 
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously 
The waters generated by thir kindes, 
And every Bird of wing after his kinde; 
And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, 
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas 
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; 
And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. 
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay 
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales 
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales 
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft 
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate 
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves 
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance 
Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, 
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend 
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food 
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, 
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk 
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate 
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan 
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep 
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, 
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles 
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. 
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares 
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon 
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd 
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge 
They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime 
With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud 
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork 
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: 
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise 
In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, 
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth 
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's 
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing 
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane 
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire 
Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: 
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song 
So1ac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings 
Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal 
Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: 
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd 
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck 
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes 
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit 
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre 
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground 
Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds 
The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine 
Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue 
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.   The Waters thus 
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, 
Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. 

The Sixt, and of Creation last arose 
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, 
Let th' Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde, 
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, 
Each in their kinde.   The Earth obey'd, and strait 
Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth 
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, 
Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose 
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns 
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; 
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: 
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: 
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks 
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung. 
The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd 
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free 
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, 
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, 
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale 
Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw 
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground 
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould 
Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd 
His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, 
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land 
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. 
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, 
Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans 
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact 
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride 
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: 
These as a line thir long dimension drew, 
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all 
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde 
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd 
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.   First crept 
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident 
Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, 
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps 
Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes 
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd 
The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone 
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells 
With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, 
And thou thir Natures know'st, & gav'st them Names, 
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown 
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, 
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes 
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee 
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. 
Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld 
Her motions, as the great first Movers hand 
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire 
Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, 
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt 
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; 
There wanted yet the Master work, the end 
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone 
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd 
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect 
His Stature, and upright with Front serene 
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence 
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, 
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good 
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes 
Directed in Devotion, to adore 
And worship God Supream, who made him chief 
Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent 
Eternal Father (For where is not hee 
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. 

Let us make now Man in our image, Man 
In our similitude, and let them rule 
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, 
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, 
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. 
This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man 
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd 
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee 
Created thee, in the Image of God 
Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. 
Male he created thee, but thy consort 
Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, 
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, 
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold 
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, 
And every living thing that moves on the Earth. 
Wherever thus created, for no place 
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows't 
He brought thee into this delicious Grove, 
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, 
Delectable both to behold and taste; 
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food 
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yields, 
Varietie without end; but of the Tree 
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, 
Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; 
Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, 
And govern well thy appetite, least sin 
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. 
Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made 
View'd, and behold all was entirely good; 
So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: 
Yet not till the Creator from his work 
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd 
Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, 
Thence to behold this new created World 
Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd 
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, 
Answering his great Idea.   Up he rode 
Followd with acclamation and the sound 
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd 
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire 
Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) 
The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, 
The Planets in thir station list'ning stood, 
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. 
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, 
Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in 
The great Creator from his work returnd 
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; 
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne 
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men 
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse 
Thither will send his winged Messengers 
On errands of supernal Grace.   So sung 
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, 
That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led 
To Gods Eternal house direct the way, 
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold 
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, 
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way 
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest 
Pouderd with Starrs.   And now on Earth the Seventh 
Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun 
Was set, and twilight from the East came on, 
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount 
Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne 
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, 
The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down 
With his great Father (for he also went 
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge 
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, 
Author and end of all things, and from work 
Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, 
As resting on that day from all his work, 
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp 
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, 
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, 
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire 
Temper'd sort Tunings, intermixt with Voice 
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds 
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. 
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, 
Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite 
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue 
Relate thee; greater now in thy return 
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day 
Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create 
Is greater then created to destroy. 
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound 
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt 
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine 
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought 
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw 
The number of thy worshippers.   Who seekes 
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves 
To manifest the more thy might: his evil 
Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. 
Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n 
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view 
On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; 
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's 
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World 
Of destind habitation; but thou know'st 
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, 
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, 
Thir pleasant dwelling place.   Thrice happie men, 
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, 
Created in his Image, there to dwell 
And worship him, and in reward to rule 
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, 
And multiply a Race of Worshippers 
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know 
Thir happiness, and persevere upright. 
So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, 
With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. 
And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd 
How first this World and face of things began, 
And what before thy memorie was don 
From the beginning, that posteritie 
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst 
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

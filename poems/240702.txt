title : Developing the Land

For six nights now the cries have sounded in the pasture: 
coyote voices fluting across the greening rise to the east 
where the deer have almost ceased to pass 
now that the developers have carved up yet another section, 
filled another space with spars and studs, concrete, runoff.

Five years ago you saw two spotted fawns rise 
for the first time from brome where brick mailboxes will stand; 
only three years past came great horned owls 
who raised two squeaking, downy owlets 
that perished in the traffic, skimming too low across the road 
behind some swift, more fortunate cottontail.

It was on an August afternoon that you drove in, 
curling down our long gravel drive past pasture and creek, 
that you saw, flickering at the edge of your sight, 
three mounted Indians, motionless in the paused breeze, 
who vanished when you turned your head.

We have felt the presence on this land of others, 
of some who paused here, some who passed, who have left 
in the thick clay shards and splinters of themselves that we dig up, 
turn up with spade and tine when we garden or bury our animals; 
their voices whisper on moonless nights in the back pasture hollow 
where the horses snort and nicker, wary with alarm.

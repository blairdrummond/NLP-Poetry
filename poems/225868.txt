title : The Brief Journey West

By the dry road the fathers cough and spit, 
This is their room. They are the ones who hung   
That bloody sun upon the southern wall   
And crushed the armored beetle to the floor. 

The father’s skin is seamed and dry, the map 
Of that wild region where they drained the swamp   
And set provision out that they might sit, 
Of history the cracked precipitate, 

Until the glass be shattered and the sun   
Descend to burn the prosperous flesh away   
Of the filthy world, so vilely fathered on   
The fathers, such black cinders, sitting there. 

Old pioneers, what lecheries remain? 
When schoolgirls pass, what whispers of their skirts,   
Cold gleams of flesh, solicit in your veined 
And gemlike eyes the custom of desire? 

None now. Their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh,   
And the sarcastic triumph of the mind 
They now enjoy, letting their lust alone   
Who may have kin but have no longer kind. 

Neither tomorrow’s monstrous tumor nor   
The reformation of the past they wish,   
Who hold in silent colloquy the world   
A shrivelled apple in the hand of God. 

They hang at night their somber flags aloft, 
And through the amorous dark pursue their theme   
Of common images, that sleep may show   
Them done with all disasters but the one.

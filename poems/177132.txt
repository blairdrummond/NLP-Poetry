title : The Infirmament

An end is always punishment for a beginning.   
If you’re Catholic, sadness is punishment 
for happiness, you become the bug you squash   
if you’re Hindu, a flinty space opens 
in your head after a long night of laughter   
and wine. For waking there are dreams,   
from French poetry, English poetry, 
for light fire although sometimes 
fire must be punished by light 
which is why psychotherapy had to be invented.   
A father may say nothing to a son for years.   
A wife may keep something small folded deep   
in her underwear drawer. Clouds come in   
resembling the terrible things we believe   
about ourselves, a rock comes loose 
from a ledge, the baby just cries 
and cries. Doll in a chair, 
windshield wipers, staring off 
into the city lights. For years 
you may be unable to hear the word monkey 
without a stab in the heart because 
she called you that the summer she thought   
she loved you and you thought you loved   
someone else and everyone loved 
your salad dressing. And the daffodils   
come up in the spring and the snow covers   
the road in winter and the water covers 
the deep trenches in the sea where all the time   
the inner stuff of this earth surges up 
which is how the continents are made   
and broken.

title : Book 6, Epigram 30

author : Thomas Bastard

text : 
Upon the plain as I rode all alone,
 Assaulted by two sturdy lads I was;
 I am a poor man Sires, let me be gone. 
 Nay, but ye shall be poor before ye pass. 
      And so I was: yet lost nothing thereby. 
      Would they had robbed me of my poverty.

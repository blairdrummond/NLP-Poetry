title : Alone with the Goddess

author : Linda Gregg

text : 
The young men ride their horses fast 
on the wet sand of Parangtritis. 
Back and forth, with the water sliding 
up to them and away. 
This is the sea where the goddess lives, 
angry, her lover taken away. 
Don’t wear red, don’t wear green here, 
the people say. Do not swim in the sea. 
Give her an offering. 
I give a coconut to protect 
the man I love. The water pushes it back. 
I wade out and throw it farther. 
“The goddess does not accept your gift,” 
an old woman says. 
I say perhaps she likes me 
and we are playing a game. 
The old woman is silent, 
the horses wear blinders of cloth, 
the young men exalt in their bodies, 
not seeing right or left, pretending 
to be brave. Sliding on and off 
their beautiful horses 
on the wet beach at Parangtritis.

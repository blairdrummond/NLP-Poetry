title : Citrus Freeze

author : Forrest Gander

text : 
To the north, along Orange Blossom Trail,   
thick breath of sludge fires.   
Smoke rises all night, a spilled genie 
who loves the freezing trees   
but cannot save them. 
Snow fine as blown spiders.   
The news: nothing. 
Large rats breed on the beach   
driving smaller ones here.   
Today both traps sit sprung.

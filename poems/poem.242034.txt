Free Verse

A gust roused the waves,
leaves blew into the water,
the waves were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn.

It was good for my heart:
there my feelings were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn. 

The breath of wind brought cooler air,
the waves of mourning brought separation:
autumn and autumn
befriend each other.

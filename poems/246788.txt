title : Step Father

author : Emanuel Xavier

text : 
He forgets that he used to call me mariconcito-
 that I harbored years of hatred toward him
 while hoping to find my real father. My
 childhood memories of him reminding me
 I was my mother's son, not his. I tried
 to poison him once and scattered sharp nails
 inside the shoes in his closet. By the time one
 of his sons died of AIDS I was already lost
 in contempt for the man I blamed for everything.
 There was the time I was in love and he met my
 boyfriend. Now he forgets to go to the bathroom
  
 or where he is but he still remembers Michael
 and asks about him. I help him walk slowly
 outdoors to step outside the prison cell that is
 the tiny apartment with no windows in which
 I grew up abused by both of them. He barely
 understands. His fate has been torture. I know
 that I cannot be his savior. I used to pray for
 him to die but here he is slowly fading. In his
 eyes I see that he learned to love me and wishes
 he could take it all back. He is unable to recall
 those drunken nights and hateful words. I should
  
 do the same. I left a long time ago but he still
 remains haunted by the little boy who wanted
 to belong. Like him, I want to forget that we
 made mistakes and caused so much pain. I need
 for both of us to remember how he taught me
 how to ride a bike and how to swim and told
 me, better late than never, that he loved me and
 was proud of all I had done. I have to help him
 settle into his favorite chair and let him know that
 I forgive him. There is a place somewhere where
 he will call me hijo and I will know him as my dad.

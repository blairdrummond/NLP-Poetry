title : Crows in a Strong Wind

author : Cornelius Eady

text : 
Off go the crows from the roof.   
The crows can’t hold on. 
They might as well 
Be perched on an oil slick. 

Such an awkward dance,   
These gentlemen 
In their spottled-black coats.   
Such a tipsy dance, 

As if they didn’t know where they were.   
Such a humorous dance, 
As they try to set things right, 
As the wind reduces them. 

Such a sorrowful dance.   
How embarrassing is love 
When it goes wrong 

In front of everyone.

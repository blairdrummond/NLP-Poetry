					                                                      II           Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.         In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. Bind me close to you with nothing.         I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence. I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.         Make my life glad with nothing.         The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. The cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.

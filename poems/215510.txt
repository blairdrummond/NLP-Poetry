How long will our bewildered heirs
marooned in possessions not theirs
puzzle at disposing of these three
cunning feignings of hard candy in glass—
the striped little pillowlike mock-sweets,
the flared end-twists as of transparent paper?

No clue will be attached, no trace 
of the sunny day of their purchase, 
at a glittering shop a few doors
up from Harry’s Bar, a disappointing place 
for all its testaments from Hemingway. 
The Grand Canal was also aglitter 
while the lesser canals lay in the shade 
like snakes, flicking wet tongues 
and gliding to green rendezvous.

The immaculate salesgirl, in her aloof 
Italian succulence, sized us up,
a middle-aged American couple,
as unserious shoppers who,
still half jet-lagged, would cling to their lire 
in the face of any enchanted vase
or ethereal wineglass that might shatter 
in the luggage going home.

Yet we wanted something, something small .... 
This? No ... How much is ten thousand? Dizzy, 
at last we decided. She wrapped
the three glass candies, the cheapest
items in the shop, with a showy care
worthy of crown jewels—tissue,
tape, and tissue again sprang up
beneath her blood-red fingernails,
plus a jack-in-the-box-shaped paper bag
adorned with harlequin lozenges, sad
though she surely was, on her feet waiting
all day for a wild rich Arab, a compulsive Japanese.
Grazie, signor ... grazie, signora ... ciao. 

Nor will our thing-weary heirs decipher 
the little repair, the reattached triangle
of glass from the paper-imitating end-twist, 
its mending a labor of love in the cellar, 
by winter light, by the man of the house, 
mixing transparent epoxy and rigging 
a clever small clamp as if to keep
intact the time that we, alive,
had spent in the feathery bed
at the Europa e Regina.

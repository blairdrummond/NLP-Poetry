Thine Own 
Josephine Delphine Henderson Heard 
1861-1921

U.S., Southern
Living



To live and not be Thine Own,
Like Springtime is when birds are flown; 
Or liberty in prison bars, 
Or evening skies without the stars; 
Like diamonds that are lusterless, 
Or rest when there's no weariness; 
Like lovely flower that have no scent, 
Or music when the sound is spent.

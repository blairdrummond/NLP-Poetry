title : Last August Hours Before the Year 2000

Spun silk of mercy, 
long-limbed afternoon, 
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems.   
What better blessing than to move without hurry   
under trees? 
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining   
house by now, roof and walls of vine— 
you could live inside this rose. 
Pouring a slow stream around the 
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit,   
I thought we would feel old 
by the year 2000. 
Walt Disney thought cars would fly. 

What a drama to keep thinking the last summer   
the last birthday 
before the calendar turns to zeroes. 
My neighbor says anything we plant 
in September takes hold. 
She’s lining pots of little grasses by her walk. 

I want to know the root goes deep   
on all that came before, 
you could lay a soaker hose across   
your whole life and know 
there was something 
under layers of packed summer earth   
and dry blown grass 
to moisten.

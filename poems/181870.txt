text : 
(or a self / sung eulogy)
Now, when I / die, dont you bury me 
On no lone prairie; 
And dont put me in no plain pine box 
(cause I left plenty cold cash!); 
And throw my cold butt in the deep blue see. 
Whatever you do, dont plant me / in no six feet of dirt; 
Just mash me, mash me, except for my dick, 
Which I want wrapped in a white / woman’s skirt. 

I dont want no preacher / man a-preaching 
Over me—cause I know where I am going. 
I dont want no tears, no flowers, 
No standing around and waiting / up / all hours. 
Just get a golden trumpet, and have Dizzy blow it. 
Cause I / wuz / Slick—and you damn well know it. 

No piano playing, no blues please; 
No moaning and groaning; 
Just lay me on the table, mash me 
Into my two-hundred-dollar suit, 
Red socks, black patent leather shoes, 
Polka-dot tie (make damn sure it’s silk— 
And dont forget it!) 

Take me out to my pink cadillac 
Prop me up / under the steering wheel, 
Tow me out to real high hill, 
Dig a hole—twenty feet long and twenty feet wide, 
Place a giant joint of reefer / weed by my side; 
Then leave me alone— 
And let me drive to hell in style!

title : The Boys at Twilight

author : Glyn Maxwell

text : 
Alive to the lilac, dead to the blue,
Bees in the act till the lilac’s through,
There’s a boy with you and a boy with you.

And the boy with you as the sun goes red
And the lamps go rose and the old to bed
Has remembered words you forgot you said.

If the time comes up when the mind is ruled
Then the nastiest face you have ever pulled
Can’t winch you clear of his lost new world,

Can’t free him or loose him or let him forget
He’s the luckiest boy you have ever met
If the time comes up when the heart is set.

You can pass him lies like so much slack.
You can mouth to his bearers behind his back.
You can fake with a passion and love with a knack.

It’s hopeless. But hopelessness full of hope
Is the serious man on the end of the rope,
Is the ring and the race and the telescope,

Is the gibbering soul at the outhouse door,
Is the flapping aloft and the crawling ashore,
Is the meaning and matching and marching to war

All hopefulness. In the looks of the shy 
Look clear through the fog and be certain why 
When the galaxy lunges across the sky

The boys flare up with a hapless glow,
And follow it out to a woods they know 
Green-smelling and smothered as years ago.

They sleep in the cold unswayable sight
Of all they envisage, the giant delight
That itself feels nothing but a scratching, slight

But not giving up. Oh, wipe them away.
There’s a boy tomorrow and a boy today,
Words they are going to remember to say,

Hopes they are going to remember from when
They have no idea but they feel them again,
Who are going to be boys, who have had to be men.

title : Slide

A playground, in a park. One lady 
raises to the top of the slide a ball 
of newspaper, gives it a kiss: 
"Ready . . . set . . . go!" Another holds 
a lampshade in her hands, smoothing 
its chenille bangs. "My daughter, 
you should see her dance— 
she's already won two prizes." 
"Did I tell you mine—he's three—can already write?" 

A girl, in line behind them with her son, 
is listening. She tightens her grip on his hand, 
hoping no one 
will notice he's real, and alive.

text : 
Naked before the glass she said,   
“I see my body as no man has,   
Nor any shall unless I wed 
And naked in a stranger’s house   
Stand timid beside his bed. 
There is no pity in the flesh.” 

“Or else I shall grow old,” she said,   
“Alone, and change my likeliness   
For a vile, slack shape, a head 
Shriveled with thinking wickedness   
Against the day I must be dead   
And eaten by my crabbed wish.” 

“One or the other way,” she said,   
“How shall I know the difference, 
When wrinkles come, to spinster or bride?   
Whether to marry or burn is bless- 
ed best, O stranger to my bed,   
There is no pity in the flesh.”

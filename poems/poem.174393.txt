Living, Sorrow & Grieving

Rhymed Stanza

   O world! O life! O time!
On whose last steps I climb,
      Trembling at that where I had stood before;
When will return the glory of your prime?
         No more?Oh, never more!

   Out of the day and night
A joy has taken flight;
      Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar,
Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight
         No more?Oh, never more!

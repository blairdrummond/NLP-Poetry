In those days I thought their endless thrum 
   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights. 
      In the throats of hibiscus and oleander 

I’d see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells 
   enameled hard as the sky before the rain. 
      All that summer, my second, from city 

to city my young father drove the black coupe 
   through humid mornings I’d wake to like fever 
      parceled between luggage and sample goods. 

Afternoons, showers drummed the roof, 
   my parents silent for hours. Even then I knew 
      something of love was cruel, was distant. 

Mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid 
   Father’d pinned in her hair shriveled 
      to a purple fist. A necklace of shells 

coiled her throat, moving a little as she 
   murmured of alligators that float the rivers 
      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes 

whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years. 
   And always the trance of blacktop shimmering 
      through swamps with names like incantations— 

Okeefenokee, where Father held my hand 
   and pointed to an egret’s flight unfolding 
      white above swamp reeds that sang with insects 

until I was lost, until I was part 
   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze 
      on my body, tattooing my skin. 

Father rocked me later by the water, 
   the motel balcony, singing calypso 
      with the Jamaican radio. The lyrics 

a net over the sea, its lesson 
   of desire and repetition. Lizards flashed 
      over his shoes, over the rail 

where the citronella burned merging our 
   shadows—Father’s face floating over mine 
      in the black changing sound 

of night, the enormous Florida night, 
   metallic with cicadas, musical 
      and dangerous as the human heart.

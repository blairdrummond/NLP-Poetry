title : Willie’s Wart

author : Kenn Nesbitt

text : 
Willie had a stubborn wart 
upon his middle toe. 
Regardless, though, of what he tried 
the wart refused to go. 

So Willie went and visited 
his family foot physician, 
who instantly agreed 
it was a stubborn wart condition. 

The doctor tried to squeeze the wart. 
He tried to twist and turn it. 
He tried to scrape and shave the wart. 
He tried to boil and burn it. 

He poked it with a pair of tongs. 
He pulled it with his tweezers. 
He held it under heat lamps, 
and he crammed it into freezers. 

Regrettably these treatments 
were of very little use. 
He looked at it and sputtered, 
“Ach! I cannot get it loose!” 

“I’ll have to get some bigger tools 
to help me to dissect it. 
I’ll need to pound and pummel it, 
bombard it and inject it.” 

He whacked it with a hammer, 
and he yanked it with a wrench. 
He seared it with a welding torch 
despite the nasty stench. 

He drilled it with a power drill. 
He wrestled it with pliers. 
He zapped it with a million volts 
from large electric wires. 

He blasted it with gamma rays, 
besieged it with corrosives, 
assaulted it with dynamite 
and nuclear explosives. 

He hit the wart with everything, 
but when the smoke had cleared, 
poor Willie’s stubborn wart remained, 
and Willie’d disappeared.

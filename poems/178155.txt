title : To Help the Monkey Cross the River

author : Thomas Lux

text : 
which he must 
cross, by swimming, for fruits and nuts, 
to help him 
I sit with my rifle on a platform   
high in a tree, same side of the river 
as the hungry monkey. How does this assist 
him? When he swims for it 
I look first upriver: predators move faster with 
the current than against it. 
If a crocodile is aimed from upriver to eat the monkey 
and an anaconda from downriver burns 
with the same ambition, I do 
the math, algebra, angles, rate-of-monkey, 
croc- and snake-speed, and if, if 
it looks as though the anaconda or the croc 
will reach the monkey 
before he attains the river’s far bank, 
I raise my rifle and fire 
one, two, three, even four times into the river 
just behind the monkey 
to hurry him up a little. 
Shoot the snake, the crocodile?   
They’re just doing their jobs,   
but the monkey, the monkey   
has little hands like a child’s, 
and the smart ones, in a cage, can be taught to smile.

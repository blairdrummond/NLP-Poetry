To an army wife, in Sardis:
  
 Some say a cavalry corps,
 some infantry, some, again,
 will maintain that the swift oars
  
 of our fleet are the finest
 sight on dark earth; but I say
 that whatever one loves, is.
  
 This is easily proved: did
 not Helen—she who had scanned
 the flower of the world’s manhood—
  
 choose as first among men one
 who laid Troy’s honor in ruin?
 warped to his will, forgetting
  
 love due her own blood, her own
 child, she wandered far with him.
 So Anactoria, although you
  
 being far away forget us,
 the dear sound of your footstep
 and light glancing in your eyes
  
 would move me more than glitter
 of Lydian horse or armored
 tread of mainland infantry

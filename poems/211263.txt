title : The Trickle-Down Theory of Happiness

author : Philip Appleman

text : 
Out of heaven, to bless the high places,   
it falls on the penthouses, drizzling   
at first, then a pelting allegro, 
and Dick and Jane skip to the terrace   
and go boogieing through the azaleas,   
while mommy and daddy come running   
with pots and pans, glasses, and basins   
and try to hold all of it up there, 
but no use, it’s too much, it keeps coming,   
and pours off the edges, down limestone 
to the pitchers and pails on the ground, where   
delirious residents catch it, 
and bucket brigades get it moving   
inside, until bathtubs are brimful,   
but still it keeps coming, that shower   
of silver in alleys and gutters, 
all pouring downhill to the sleazy   
red brick, and the barefoot people   
who romp in it, laughing, but never   
take thought for tomorrow, all spinning   
in a pleasure they catch for a moment;   
so when Providence turns off the spigot   
and the sky goes as dry as a prairie, 
then daddy looks down from the penthouse,   
down to the streets, to the gutters,   
and his heart goes out to his neighbors,   
to the little folk thirsty for laughter,   
and he prays in his boundless compassion:   
on behalf of the world and its people   
he demands of his God, give me more.

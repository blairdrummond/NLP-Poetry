title : Death Is Not As Natural As You Fags Seem to Think

author : Amiri Baraka

text : 
I hunt 
the black puritan. 
                            (Half-screamer 

in dull tones 
of another forest. 

Respecter of power. That it transform, and enlarge   
Hierarchy crawls over earth (change exalting space   

Dried mud to mountain, cape and whip, swirled   
Walkers, and riders and flyers. 
Language spread into darkness. Be Vowel 
                                                            and value   
                                              Consonant 
                                                            and direction.   
Rather the lust of the thing 
than across to droop at its energies. In melted snows   
the leather cracks, and pure men claw at their bodies.   
Women laugh delicately, delicately rubbing their thighs. 

And the dead king laughs, looking out the hole   
in his tomb. Seeing the poor   
singing his evil songs.

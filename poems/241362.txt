title : Delia Rexroth

author : Kenneth Rexroth

text : 
died June 1916
Under your illkempt yellow roses,
 Delia, today you are younger
 Than your son. Two and a half decades –
 The family monument sagged askew,
 And he overtook you for half-a-life.
 On the other side of the country,
 Near the willows by the slow river,
 Deep in the earth, the white ribs retain
 The curve of your fervent, careful breast;
 The fine skull, the ardor of your brain.
 And in the fingers the memory
 Of Chopin études, and in the feet
 Slow waltzes and champagne twosteps sleep.
 And the white full moon of midsummer,
 That you watched awake all that last night,
 Watches history fill the deserts 
 And oceans with corpses once again;
 And looks in the east window at me,
 As I move past you to middle age
 And knowledge past your agony and waste.

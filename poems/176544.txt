title : My Violin

author : Bruce Lansky

text : 
My mom brought home a violin 
so I could learn to play. 
She told me if I practiced hard 
I’d play it well someday. 

Without a single lesson, 
I tried to play a song. 
My fiddle squeaked, my fiddle squawked. 
The notes came out all wrong. 

My little brother fled the room. 
Mom covered up her ears. 
My puppy dog began to howl. 
My sister was in tears. 

My dad pulled out his wallet. 
He handed me a ten. 
He made me swear I’d never play 
that violin again.

Amant in bed,   
      dreaming. 
      There are no   
      borders to this   
      miniature. 

B moves Bateau across the night.   
It is all the loops can do 
to let their gilding 
bulge with what is there. 
One light on the wide sea. 
The bones of stars. 

      No other country is so 
      curiously watered. 
      From the estuaries to the very 
      sources of its inwardtending channels,   
      it rises in fogs which are themselves   
      arterial. For its earth 
      has more than once been seen 
      quite early in the morning 
      to lighten and give way. 

At the gate to the garden,   
Fair Welcome.   
She raises her hand. 
Salutare: 
to greet and to save. 

      Leisures of tendrils are on all sides,   
      winding with the snails 
      through white acanthus and discarded   
      badges of pilgrims. 
      You may assign to the nineteen 
      portholes in these borders 
      whatever you like. 

The sand is of such fineness 
and the flow so singly clear 
that nothing seems to pass through,   
golden, and with all its lights. 

      Water makes very much the best 
      portable horizon. 
      While its reflections are 
      fainter than those in the speculum,   
      their angles may be measured 
      accurately 
      and the differences from a true meridian   
      reckoned by the clock. 
      These sightings should be taken at least   
      three hours 
      before and after noon. 

Two liveried falconers, 
the jesses and bells, the gloves.   
Amant with the dove’s neck-ring,   
The lady in her chamber. 
Winter trees, rooks in the white   
branches, hounds, the dying boar. 
On the top of a mountain   
a lion waving his tail. 

      The general course of the river   
      straightens, and is moderately timbered.   
      Scattered islands covered w/willow. 
      Across from a single, long bluff of open rock,   
      the plain to the S. is higher, extending   
      quite to the mountains which contain still   
      great quantities of snow. 
      A small creek falls in from this side.   
      Pursued its bottom for perhaps 4 m.   
      Cottonwood. Much evidence of beaver. 

Now all of this is to be understood   
in a spiritual manner. 
Let us cover 
the nakedness of our fathers   
with the cloak of a 
favorable interpretation. 

      Under a dry stalk of burdock, iron-brown   
      latches and fittings, a few nails. 
      The bulls are eating apples. 
      Thick grasses sweat through the whole pasture. 

Dame Reason with her 
chaplet of apothegms. 
He should put his heart 
in a single place only. 
The truest things about bodies   
are their shadows. 

      Pleas put me back   
      in the water I am 
      Paddle-to-the-Sea 

She has done this before.   
She wades into the current 
to the one point where the current 
lounges at her hips. 
She stands there. 
With all the time in the world,   
steadily, she kneels steadily 
deeper, to her shoulders, smiling, her hair 
cupped in both hands behind her neck. 

      The Familiar gives Its first   
      lesson to the lover. 
      A new order 
      is one that is renewed 
      hourly. 

A drove of geese in its tall, while file   
plucks home through the wet fallow.   
Hedges darken between the fields.   
Along the wolds for miles in level tracts,   
haze from the lime-kilns. 
All quarters of the sky are wintry, huge. 

      We could no longer be sure 
      that we had passed the Préveranges.   
      Freshets from the little stream   
      poured onto the lane, filling 
      ruts and drainages. In the dusk,   
      and with our shoes soaked, we set   
      off through a meadow, and another,   
      and found soon an abandoned   
      cottage of some old forester. 
      We determined that I should 
      stay and secure it as an outpost.   
      Meaulnes went on alone. 

At an earlier hour, 
the ground at the wood’s edge   
illumines to some thousand   
footcandles, fades under the   
canopies, the layers 
of trees, of shrubs and herbs,   
under the dark itself, 
brighter by as many 
eyes as are buried there. 

      Tied to a washboard,   
      submerged, 
      the panes of glass 
      chime like clean ice. 

they are dangers harebells and   
just where the fall goes over   
they lean into the spray so   
far and bob so on their stems   
they thrill and a hammer rings   
carillon down the cows spine   
feel it there it goes again 

      Death hath its seat 
      close to the entrance of delight.   
                         —Gudique 

Sifting over porches and limp hibiscus,   
rust from the canvas awnings, 
its red spores dull in a moon that shows   
everything, houses and driveways,   
fishponds, all of them 
hiding from their insides, forgetting,   
looking around. 

      there is no way to lie down   
      and not lie in the same way   
      that someone has had to lie   
      thinking of how far it is 
      to the places no one goes   
      or to any place this far 
      from the beds where the dying   
      cry into the night this far 

Deacons and presbyters. 
The Laying On of Hands.   
In a vial, 
juice from the wild cucumber,   
powdered glass, 
the divine Endura.

Couplet

Out of the wood of thoughts that grows by night
 To be cut down by the sharp axe of light,--
 Out of the night, two cocks together crow,
 Cleaving the darkness with a silver blow:
 And bright before my eyes twin trumpeters stand,
 Heralds of splendour, one at either hand,
 Each facing each as in a coat of arms:
 The milkers lace their boots up at the farms.

herds of buffalo
gone now
                       you search the undulating
         sea of grass
near campo and wildhorse
                       for the great hairy horned whales
but none surface

instead
if you look carefully

                        you see the shallow swimming
          hahe issi
the pronghorn
antelope
                     you identify with
          this striped sailfish
skimming the surface
                       a harpoon’s throw away
        from hungry nesters

diving
                     for the cereal great plains
         plankton seed
visible
but fast

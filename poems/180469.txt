text : 
Raymond Radiguet
Like seven birds sleeping on the plateau 
Overlooking the shipwreck of love, mystery 
Of the drunken visitors wandering off 
With your wife, men who talk with a bad accent, 
The condemned the abandoned, one day of silence, 
Two days of silence, dreams shattered and protected, 
The more the blossoms the more you suffer.

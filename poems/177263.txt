title : My Erotic Double

author : John Ashbery

He says he doesn’t feel like working today. 
It’s just as well. Here in the shade 
Behind the house, protected from street noises,    
One can go over all kinds of old feeling, 
Throw some away, keep others. 
                                             The wordplay 
Between us gets very intense when there are   
Fewer feelings around to confuse things. 
Another go-round? No, but the last things 
You always find to say are charming, and rescue me   
Before the night does. We are afloat 
On our dreams as on a barge made of ice, 
Shot through with questions and fissures of starlight   
That keep us awake, thinking about the dreams 
As they are happening. Some occurrence. You said it. 

I said it but I can hide it. But I choose not to.   
Thank you. You are a very pleasant person.   
Thank you. You are too.

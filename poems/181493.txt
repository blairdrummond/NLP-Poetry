Gram of mania, animated pepper, 
shadow-monger dressed in panic, 
monitor of  ghostly footfalls, 
it concentrates in its essential tic 
the frog leg dropped into oil 
and the human shock at the verge. 
If  it would stop and let me look, 
I might imagine the tropic 
where it hangs in a hammock 
between two popsicle sticks 
admiring the iguana’s stealth, 
but it does not stop. Hawk- 
dodger, crow-pretzel, gallows’ 
twitch. Spider-shark. Porter 
of  readiness, miller of  the 
steady shudder, peripatetic 
rectitude, run by the power 
of   the sunlit rock, it fortifies 
Darwin and the idea of   being late 
and the missed appointment. 
With its blue tail, it reminds us: 
it will go on. It will not stop.

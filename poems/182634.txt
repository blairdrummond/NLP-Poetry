title : Feather in Bas-Relief

author : Allen Edwin Butt

text : 
Words without much use 
now. Unable to remake 
the thing. And I thought 

what should I think— 
followed by: spring light looks 
like feathers. (Birds 

seemed conveniently 
decorous.) What then 
does this leave I asked 

& was surprised to know 
so quickly—that my understanding 
of what the light & birds 

could not be made to mean 
would not detract 
from them as they 

were. Bound by feathers 
(a thought, I will admit, 
born of artifice alone) 

they bore themselves aloft. 
What could I counter with? 
I, who held my heart 

in offering as much for 
show as for a fear so deep 
I found I couldn't name it.

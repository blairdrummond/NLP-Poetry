I’ve expanded like the swollen door in summer 
            to fit my own dimension. Your loneliness 

is a letter I read and put away, a daily reminder 
            in the cry of the magpie that I am 

still capable of inflicting pain 
            at this distance. 

Like a painting, our talk is dense with description, 
            half-truths, landscapes, phrases layered 

with a patina over time. When she came into my life 
            I didn’t hesitate. 

Or is that only how it seems now, looking back? 
            Or is that only how you accuse me, looking back? 

Long ago, this desert was an inland sea. In the mountains 
            you can still find shells. 

It’s these strange divagations I’ve come to love: midday sun 
            on pink escarpments; dusk on gray sandstone; 

toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot 
            climb to Acoma Pueblo, where the spirit 

of the dead hovers about its earthly home 
            four days, before the prayer sticks drive it away. 

Today all good Jews collect their crimes like old clothes 
            to be washed and given to the poor. 

I remember how my father held his father around the shoulders 
            as they walked to the old synagogue in Philadelphia.

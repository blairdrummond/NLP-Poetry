title : Poem in October

author : Dylan Thomas

text : 
It was my thirtieth year to heaven 
Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood   
      And the mussel pooled and the heron 
                  Priested shore 
            The morning beckon 
With water praying and call of seagull and rook 
And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall   
            Myself to set foot 
                  That second 
      In the still sleeping town and set forth. 

      My birthday began with the water- 
Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name   
      Above the farms and the white horses 
                  And I rose   
            In rainy autumn 
And walked abroad in a shower of all my days. 
High tide and the heron dived when I took the road 
            Over the border 
                  And the gates 
      Of the town closed as the town awoke. 

      A springful of larks in a rolling 
Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling   
      Blackbirds and the sun of October 
                  Summery 
            On the hill’s shoulder, 
Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly   
Come in the morning where I wandered and listened   
            To the rain wringing 
                  Wind blow cold 
      In the wood faraway under me. 

      Pale rain over the dwindling harbour 
And over the sea wet church the size of a snail   
      With its horns through mist and the castle   
                  Brown as owls 
            But all the gardens 
Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales   
Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.   
            There could I marvel 
                  My birthday 
      Away but the weather turned around. 

      It turned away from the blithe country 
And down the other air and the blue altered sky   
      Streamed again a wonder of summer 
                  With apples 
            Pears and red currants 
And I saw in the turning so clearly a child’s 
Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother   
            Through the parables 
                  Of sun light 
      And the legends of the green chapels 

      And the twice told fields of infancy 
That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.   
      These were the woods the river and sea 
                  Where a boy 
            In the listening 
Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy   
To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide. 
            And the mystery 
                  Sang alive 
      Still in the water and singingbirds. 

      And there could I marvel my birthday 
Away but the weather turned around. And the true   
      Joy of the long dead child sang burning 
                  In the sun. 
            It was my thirtieth 
Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon   
Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.   
            O may my heart’s truth 
                  Still be sung 
      On this high hill in a year’s turning.

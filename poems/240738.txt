one box falls out of another box, ashy covenant of separation
 two birds, one clamp, no reaction just hanging there as the arrow moved
 notes put the map back into the water
 they don’t notice what they’re learning
 name all the days, parts of them painted to look out of control then crashed into a tree
 letters in the boxes in the light old lady opportunity
 the mirror ceases to be right here, pressure on the hand sends a biscuit to the mouth
 a circuit connected by eyes stopping watching
 quantity of information in the type, nation in the line or lines
 legs broken and maladroit preview a long corridor filing against
 walls engaging hands going without end in the corridor
 back to front to quay, cracking of wood, a miner’s ladder five meters high
 notices filled with objects
 later, however, a gelatin lit up, Chinese cryptesthesia, American music
 mural fold or fist, magnetic moment measures behavior, thinking penetrates slowly
 start over a sensible solution, a compact rower’s body zippered
 into an orange flight suit, all the confidence of the Chinese navy exposing a big area extinct of life forms

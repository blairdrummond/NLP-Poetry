title : In Prison

author : Jean Valentine

text : 
In prison 
without being accused 

or reach your family 
or have a family            You have 

conscience 
heart trouble 

asthma 
manic-depressive 

(we lost the baby) 
no meds 

no one 
no window 

black water 
nail-scratched walls 

your pure face turned away 
embarrassed 

you 
who the earth was for.

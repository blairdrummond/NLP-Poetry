title : Vanishing Interior

Little patches of grass disappear
 In the jaws of lusty squirrels
  
 Who slip into the spruce.
 Cars collapse into parts.
  
 Spring dissolves into summer,
 The kitten into the cat.
  
 A tray of drinks departs from the buffet
 And voilà! the party’s over.
  
 All that’s left are some pickles
 And a sprig of wilting parsley on the rug.
  
 When I think of all those 
 Gong-tormented Mesozoic seas
  
 I feel a ripple of extinction
 And blow a smoke ring through the trees.
  
 Soon there will be nothing left here but sky.
 When I think about the fact
  
 I am not thinking about you
 It is a new way of thinking about you.

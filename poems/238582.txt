Once again, I've missed Lamb Chop's Play-Along
Which, as it is, isn't
broadcast in Papiamento, myself being the Centurion
of the English where I am

Aha! The Brook, Cherith running by here meaning
the while I can “compare notes” with Elijah
(Without a Jezebel to spook him!)
Although admittedly
in the movie Betty Davis is a winnter, ever quite
without a struggle
           Especially in the Waltz sequence

Which continues to reverberate in my head. So that I ask

“Is it, I, then, that am “The Revenant”?

This McTalk
with its “scrolling windows”
can never answer. But just now, could use

A bit of that compote of “stewed pears

          With cinnamon”

The discalced
                    Carmelite Sisters
fed San Juan De La Cruz
thus, nursing and resusciating him back 
                                           to “health”
Which is, in itself, at best
         —a provisional state!

Other than that,
          “IT's the most
Wonderful Time Of The Year! “So goes
the theme song Andy Williams 'Seasons' Greetings
TV Special, which makes me exceedingly
nostalgic for I know not what

Not too “christmasy” for the
Chechnians at the moment. I know

“People” are looking
for the excitement of the Moulin Rouge
                     Or a “Go-at”
         the Slopes!

**-But   just a sighting

                      Of your red
hair would
          be “enough” for me       —If, that is

There ever could be enough in that.

                     “golden lamps hanging in
a Green Night”

Juba this and that     in your lithe thighs

On this occasion
         Scattered automatic weaponry—
fire in the distance: “Welcome to
                     Redwood City”, etc.


                                                                     1997
                                                Redwood City, Calif.

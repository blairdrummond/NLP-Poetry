born in babylonbabylon Once a great city in Biblical times, see Psalms 137; also used as a dismissive term in western Black cultures for “anything to which the Black consciousness represents the degenerate or oppressive state of white culture” (OED) 
both nonwhite and woman 
what did i see to be except myself? 
i made it up

starshine and clay,between / starshine and clay Compare to John Keats’s “betwixt damnation and impassion’d clay” in “On Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again.”  
my one hand holding tight 
my other hand; come celebrate

something has tried to kill me 
and has failed.

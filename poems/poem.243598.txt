Implausible fish bloom in the depths,
mercurial flowers light up the coast;
I know red and yellow, the other colors,--

but the sea, det granna granna havet, that's most dangerous
                                                                            to look at.
What name is there for the color that arouses
this thirst, which says,
the saga can happen, even to you--

Translated from the Swedish by Averill Curdy

It’s mostly the same here 
slow as melonvines in an arctic sun 
where the great ball of the plane 
went down in nineteen thirty-five & an eskimo 
with a camera took a picture that stayed 
in his camera twenty-one years 
& by some chance he told 
an explorer who bought the film 
& found the crash 
& the bodies under tarp looking like 
two seals on the ice, 
the crumpled plane with oversized pontoons, 
the propeller as though 
it could turn again— 
the men, Wiley Post & Will Rogers, 
still twelve miles southwest of Barrow, Alaska.

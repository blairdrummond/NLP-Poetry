         I 
In the moonlight, 
in the heavy snow, 
I was hunting along 
the sunken road 
and heard behind me 
the quiet step 
and smothered whimper 
of something following . . .

Ah, tree of panic 
I climbed 
to escape the night, 
as the furry body glided 
beneath, lynx with   
steady gaze, and began 
the slow ascent. 

         II 
And dark blue foxes 
climbed beside me with 
famished eyes that   
glowed in the shadows; 

I stabbed with 
a sharpened stick until 
one lay across 
the path with entrails 
spilled, and 
the others melted away. 

The dead fox 
moved again, his jaws 
released the 
sound of speech. 

         III 
Slowly I toiled 
up the rotting stairs 
to the cemetery 
where my mother lay buried, 

to find the open grave 
with the coffin 
tilted beside it, 
and something spilled 
from the bottom— 

a whiteness that flowed 
on the ground 
and froze into mist that 
enveloped the world.

But I have been familiar with ruins too long to dislike desolation.       (Lord Byron, November 1816) ﻿
what happens in any
  
 sovereign body is created
  
 on the evidence of the last
  
 head on its last lap
  
 those of us watching
  
 then, during the programme
  
 see the die seem to be cast
  
 to draw the teeth
  
 of our first question
  
 affecting essential interests
  
 they and only they had
  
 she was dealing with
  
 an unworthy family
  
 gathered for death
  
 inconvenient location
  
 gruesome tired mannerisms
  
 a bit thick coming from her
  
 losing the thread of argument
  
 in a sinuous cartwheel
  
 drained of what life
  
 hurried out with a pushchair
  
 unsparing he takes us
  
 to the cabaret
  
 into patterns and groups
  
 contrived for distraction
  
 more likely
  
 to deepen withdrawal
  
 such a decrease
  
 in which women
  
 had views diametrically opposed
  
 soon changes his tune
  
 howling
  
 face to face
  
 cruel for people
  
 recoiling in horror
  
 plastered indeed
  
 by any form of social
  
 charges and interest
  
 it may be healthy
  
 to change the tone
  
 of administration
  
 in growth dynamics
  
 use of perspective
  
 attachment to things
  
 entail perpetual disruption
  
 of what space is for
  
 built up
  
 in absence
  
 transactions typically occur
  
 under conditions of heightened
  
 variations in taste
  
 spaces, isolated thoughts
  
 which his concept of beauty
  
 distorts to represent
  
 thinking and feeling life
  
 he considers in particular
  
 superimposed spatial images
  
 accelerating production
  
 of different times
  
 to control the future
  
 this book has been edited 

to detect the note
  
 of such preoccupations
  
 blue evening light
  
 desire out of stasis
  
 for jobs
  
 investment itself
  
 ruthless traders
  
 organising forces
  
 unable to stop the drift
  
 of imagination over materiality
  
 form an autobiography
  
 in fires of competition
  
 only to emerge stronger
  
 within this system of production
  
 brought into our homes
  
 which in turn form the basis
  
 of generating and acquiring 
  
 aesthetic pleasure
  
 conventional these days
  
 cluttered with illusion
  
 based on writing
  
 remixed
  
 to demolish any narrative
  
 of the world within
  
 no image concealed
  
 from the realm of material
  
 accumulation and circulation
  
 in part as would be true
  
 enduring time
  
 by herself he touches her
  
 surrounded by models
  
 able to pass unrecognised
  
 in the stream of money
  
 implied by a photograph
  
 where the sun never seen
  
 can be constructed
  
 crashing through layer after layer
  
 on a depthless screen
  
 with the requisite speed
  
 somewhere behind us
  
 thrown into the street
  
 patiently to see 
  
 rotting pieces of car
  
 buttons working backwards
  
 against nerve junctions
  
 tilt her head
  
 towards her ankles
  
 in the underground light
  
 black fur gleamed
  
 off the oil drum
  
 searchers found
  
 a delicate bubble of oil
  
 sweeping through it
  
 pure oxygen
  
 dawn touched
  
 at the corners
  
 rose in flame
  
 lengths of thin steel
  
 drawn across dust
  
 shifting in thick
  
 time on
  
 motions playing out
  
 across from me
  
 not in sequence
  
 cut into the sides 
  
 of an extension run
  
 below his eyes
  
 were tombstones
  
 ringed with razor-wire
  
 he threaded 
  
 bright slashes of colour
  
 through open
  
 jolts of fear
  
 measuring, calculating
  
 shaking so hard
  
 a lump of shadow
  
 watching
  
 turned from side to side
  
 shielding us from the sun
  
 pale green glass
  
 frames disintegrating tarmac
  
 down to the tunnel
  
 of the corner of his eye
  
 moving on
  
 to some other
  
 man for the moment
  
 horizon of empty water
  
 locking him away
  
 inside and he wore
  
 two pictograms
  
 set in strange lines
  
 invisible in air
  
 energetically above them
  
 heels and silk
  
 scatter snow
  
 in the middle of a room
  
 swirling out of the mist
  
 bright with arrangements
  
 tainted too historically
  
 he had forgotten
  
 quite violent fights
  
 listening
  
 to the continuous pounding
  
 of some other thought
  
 looking at the surface
  
 far away down
  
 in a cloud of dust
  
 tattered lace about her
  
 she watched him calmly
  
 bits of it he tore off
  
 at the end of each meeting
  
 seemed colour-coded
  
 sparkling violently
  
 tingling on his skin
  
 holes turned round slowly
  
 in brown earth
  
 lined with age
  
 he smelled burning
  
 trees in darkness
  
 a voice came
  
 from an imaginary telephone
  
 on the dashboard
  
 shrink-wrapped packages
  
 soft underfoot
  
 glowed in the dark
  
 blinds slanted to make
  
 the match flame
  
 blast across his face
  
 snap shut
  
 in the jungle
  
 after the ones still alive
  
 start confessing
  
 flashbulbs go off
  
 her hand flicked back and forth
  
 over a section of floor
  
 he had heard more
  
 than every single word
  
 from the once proud
  
 ruins of arches
  
 in one outstretched hand
  
 an odd sensation
  
 included balance
  
 working to repair the damage
  
 of triumph on his face
  
 folded against the edge
  
 of exhaust fumes
  
 closing his lids
  
 properly needed great care
  
 she heard a rustle
  
 little numbers
  
 flew around trees
  
 tumbled across a moonlit field
  
 trying to reassemble
  
 his head again
  
 she blinked
  
 some sort of code
  
 subtle variations
  
 in the colour of her eyes
  
 a reliable testing ground
  
 gardens inside shelters
  
 shades patterning
  
 an idealised culture
  
 in one landscaped clump
  
 stuffed full of shells
  
 a version or remnant of something
  
 under a different name
  
 some crisis of identity
  
 spanned the world
  
 thought was the only thing
  
 to come back to acting
  
 beyond acoustics
  
 even when dramatic
  
 she always wore fancy dress
  
 simply cut and held low
  
 objects grouped together
  
 confidently into fine jewellery
  
 after the storm new scents
  
 touched by salt spray
  
 hardly dimmed the harsh light
  
 he sometimes pulled at his hair
  
 obsessed with finding the beautiful
  
 curtain allowing him entry
  
 never able to follow
  
 the middle of night
  
 downwards to find a runway
  
 with deep sides
  
 writhing under his fingers
  
 personalities full of energy
  
 order a series
  
 of the same programme
  
 cool for film
  
 using this knowledge
  
 machines talk to themselves
  
 maintain a very persistent
  
 buzzing as the signal
  
 ends in a dramatic freeze
  
 close to the border
  
 on a street with a few orange trees

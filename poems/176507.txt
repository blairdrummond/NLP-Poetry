title : Night Thoughts

author : Carl Rakosi

text : 
After the jostling on canal streets 
and the orchids blowing in the window   
I work in cut glass and majolica 
and hear the plectrum of the angels. 

My thoughts keep dwelling on the littoral   
where china clocks tick in the cold shells   
and the weeds slide in the equinox. 

The night is cold for love,   
a chamber for the chorus 
and the antistrophe of the sealight.

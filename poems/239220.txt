title : Vain and Careless

author : Robert Graves

text : 
Lady, lovely lady,
    Careless and gay!
 Once when a beggar called
    She gave her child away.
  
 The beggar took the baby,
    Wrapped it in a shawl,
 “Bring her back,” the lady said,
    “Next time you call.”
  
 Hard by lived a vain man,
    So vain and so proud,
 He walked on stilts
    To be seen by the crowd.
  
 Up above the chimney pots,
    Tall as a mast,
 And all the people ran about
    Shouting till he passed.
  
 “A splendid match surely,”
    Neighbours saw it plain,
 “Although she is so careless,
    Although he is so vain.”
  
 But the lady played bobcherry,
    Did not see or care,
 As the vain man went by her
    Aloft in the air.
  
 This gentle-born couple
    Lived and died apart.
 Water will not mix with oil,
    Nor vain with careless heart.

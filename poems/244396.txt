title : Red Beans

author : Victor Hernández Cruz

text : 
Next  to white rice
 it looks like coral
 sitting next to snow
  
 Hills of starch
 border
 The burnt sienna
 of irony
  
 Azusenas being chased by
 the terra cotta feathers
 of a rooster
  
 There is a lava flow
 through the smoking
 white mounds
  
 India red
 spills on ivory
  
 Ochre cannon balls
 falling
 next to blanc pebbles
  
 Red beans and milk
 make burgundy wine
  
 Violet pouring
 from the eggshell
 tinge of the plate.

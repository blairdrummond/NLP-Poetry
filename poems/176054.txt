title : Man in Space

author : Billy Collins

text : 
All you have to do is listen to the way a man 
sometimes talks to his wife at a table of people 
and notice how intent he is on making his point 
even though her lower lip is beginning to quiver,

and you will know why the women in science 
fiction movies who inhabit a planet of their own
are not pictured making a salad or reading a magazine 
when the men from earth arrive in their rocket,

why they are always standing in a semicircle 
with their arms folded, their bare legs set apart, 
their breasts protected by hard metal disks.

title : Sole Blessing

author : J. Allyn Rosser

text : 
To say screw them, to be screw-them 
bent on one thing all but lost, 
one music or mystery, 
beyond all the necessary 
incidental snaggings of the heart; 

to train the whole soul’s beam 
on a solitary hill, or on it 
a special kind of rock or creeper; 
to be sated just by saxophone; 
to want nothing but your eyes 

lifelong to study Scottish otters: 
the snub, slippery-whiskered snout; 
the way they intertwine in threes 
at play, indistinguishably bound, 
long sleek backs submerging away... 

To make of this your being’s aim, 
its joy, and know by pulse and viscus 
the word joy. No gifts but thine 
to thyself: thou canst, if thou list, 
single out, make good, one wish. 

This from the dumb lips of an old god 
who with one endless, misty hand 
holds out to us too much to love, 
and with the other—crooked-fingered, 
crazed with veins—some nights and days.

The man vending needles at our door   
Was lucky to greet you. 
He looked poor but you acted needle-poor   
Where I’d have said, I don’t need ... 

He sells needles to prick your heart   
And they’ll take small bites 
Out of my finger in a layer of skin   
Where my feelings are thin. 

The old thread knitting together his many wools   
Might last another trudge 
To our porch: he came last year but I 
Refused and barely looked him in the eye. 

I’ve lost how many needles since then?   
Besides he is mute 
And would see how dumb we are to buy   
Three hundred needles for relief. 

But he supplied us to the end of life. 
I’ll give away some. 
And you might never use these points 
That push through cloth, cut to be made one.

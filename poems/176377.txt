I’ve caught fish everwhichaway they can be.
On the Chattahoochee River I’ve used nets, gigs, 
trot lines, and bare hands. Even electricity. 
One day Braleigh and me caught so many 
that two-ended punt boat nearly went under. 
We were boys and didn’t know any better. 
Catfish were plentiful as water for all 
we could figure. That was back then. 
We’d wrap the copper pipe and drop it in,
then use the telephone battery to make a wet cell 
of that whole muddy dogleg of the river. 
The small channel cats would rise, then 
recover, but big whites and blues would float, 
belly up, and we’d haul ’em in, fill the boat 
to the oarlocks with fresh fish to eat or sell. 
Their backs shined so bright it was a wonder. 
But let me tell you this: it was also a danger. 
If you caught the coil wrong or touched iron 
binding on that old craft with a live wire, 
it was enough to knock you on your ass. 
A man could get killed just trying to catch fish. 
Of course, such a method was a sin against Jesus 
and man, fish and fresh water, but we didn’t savvy. 
We were just free as gnats for the summer, 
a little enterprising and a little hungry. 
Besides, we hadn’t heard of sport or mercy. 
That was a cooter’s age ago. That was then.

title : Eschatology

author : Sandra McPherson

text : 
I accompany this life’s events like a personal journalist:   
“Little did she know when she got in the car that afternoon ...”; 
or “Despite inauspicious beginnings, 
this was to be their happiest year.” 

Little did I expect that our horoscopes would prove true.   
And how could we foresee an answer to 
that frankly secular prayer, we with so little faith   
as to be false prophets to our most fortunate gifts. 

I am glad when doom fails. Inept apocalypse 
is a specialty of the times: the suffering of the rich 
at the hand of riches; the second and third comings of wars. 

Shouldn’t we refuse prediction 
that the untried today is guilty, that immeasurable   
as this child’s hope is, it will break tomorrow?

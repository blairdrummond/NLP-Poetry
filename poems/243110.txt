title : Mirrors at 4 a.m.

author : Charles Simic

text : 
You must come to them sideways
 In rooms webbed in shadow, 
 Sneak a view of their emptiness
 Without them catching
 A glimpse of you in return.
  
 The secret is, 
 Even the empty bed is a burden to them,
 A pretense. 
 They are more themselves keeping
 The company of a blank wall,
 The company of time and eternity
  
 Which, begging your pardon,
 Cast no image
 As they admire themselves in the mirror,
 While you stand to the side
 Pulling a hanky out
 To wipe your brow surreptitiously.

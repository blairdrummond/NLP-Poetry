Come To Sunny Prestatyn 
Laughed the girl on the poster, 
Kneeling up on the sand   
In tautened white satin.   
Behind her, a hunk of coast, a 
Hotel with palms 
Seemed to expand from her thighs and   
Spread breast-lifting arms. 

She was slapped up one day in March.   
A couple of weeks, and her face 
Was snaggle-toothed and boss-eyed;   
Huge tits and a fissured crotch 
Were scored well in, and the space   
Between her legs held scrawls 
That set her fairly astride 
A tuberous cock and balls 

Autographed Titch Thomas, while   
Someone had used a knife 
Or something to stab right through   
The moustached lips of her smile.   
She was too good for this life.   
Very soon, a great transverse tear   
Left only a hand and some blue.   
Now Fight Cancer is there.

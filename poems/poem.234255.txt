All trembling in my arms Aminta lay, 
Defending of the bliss I strove to take; 
Raising my rapture by her kind delay, 
Her force so charming was and weak. 
The soft resistance did betray the grant, 
While I pressed on the heaven of my desires; 
Her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant; 
Her dying eyes assume new fires. 
Now to the height of languishment she grows, 
And still her looks new charms put on; 
Now the last mystery of Love she knows, 
We sigh, and kiss: I waked, and all was done. 

'Twas but a dream, yet by my heart I knew, 
Which still was panting, part of it was true: 
Oh how I strove the rest to have believed; 
Ashamed and angry to be undeceived!

text : 
“Take me with you” 
my mother says 
standing in her nightgown 
as, home from college, 
I prepare to leave 
before dawn. 
The desolation 
she must face 
was once my concern 
but like a bobber 
pulled beneath  
the surface 
by an inedible fish 
she vanished 
into the life 
he offered her. 
It stopped occurring 
to me she might return. 
“I’ll be back” I say 
and then I go.

title : Oh God

text : 
spilling water from my back,
 you call and i come.
 that exhausted walk to reach you
 breathless and no i didn’t run
 to see you, i’ve been smoking
 too much, same thing.
  
 another awkward hug in the car
 as my face smashes your cheek
 that i can feel it leaving now
 is the saddest, a beautiful eruption
 you could have picked it off the tree
 and chowed
  
 but you weren’t hungry.
 feeling it dying away all day
 much worse than the straining
 against the leash, another gorgeous
 thing that should not have happened,
 gone again.

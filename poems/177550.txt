title : A Pathological Case in Pliny

author : John Logan

text : 
Hirto corde gigni quosdam homines proditur, neque alios fortioris esse industriae, sicut Aristomenen Messenium qui trecentos occidit Lacedaemonios ... —Plinii, Naturalis Historia XI. Ixx.
The guards sleep they breathe uneven   
Conversation with the 
Trees the sharp cicadas 
And knots of pine the flames 
Have stirred to talk: their light 

Shows him rolling in his bonds   
As if he dragged his bones   
Again beyond a tall 
And ghosted mist of blood;   
He took three hundred lives 

And will not give his own for capture   
Even. The smell of searing 
Hemp and flesh startles 
As the scream of birds— 
Should wake the guards of men 

Or dead. The fire flares and frames   
A running giant his wrists 
Caught between his thighs; 
A burned and awkward god. 
Once he tried the foxes’ 

Paths out of the shattered quarry.   
No way now. One may 
Kill his hundreds; still 
No way. How can he live 
Without his heart. Throw him 

To the ground and prepare knives! 
Do they by their hate 
Or wonder break the breast   
He shut to fear? Mock 
Or pray as they cut flesh 

Crush ribs and lay all open 
To the alien chill of air? 
No scream tears 
From him; the tiny veins 
Along his eyelid swell 

And pools of sweat gather at its corners. 
But they do not see his 
Slowly swinging eyes. 
They watch his heart; its brown 
Hair is whorled and dry.

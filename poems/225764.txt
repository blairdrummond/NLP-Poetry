title : Song of the Two Crows

author : Hayden Carruth

text : 
I sing of Morrisville   
(if you call this cry 
      a song). I 
(if you call this painful 

voice by that great name)   
sing the poverty of my 
      region and of 
the wrong end of Morrisville. 

You summer people will say   
that all its ends are wrong,   
      but there, right there, 
the very end of the wrong end— 

a house with windows sagging,   
leaning roadward as in defense   
      or maybe defiance 
next to the granite ledge, 

our cliff of broken stone 
that shoulders our dilapidated 
        one-lane iron bridge.   
Who lives here? I don’t know. 

But they (Hermes reward them)   
made this extraordinary garden,   
        geraniums, 
petunias and nasturtiums 

planted in every crevice and all   
the footholds of the cliff. 
        And then 
they painted the cliff-face, 

painted the old stone; no design,   
just swatches of color, bold 
        rough splashes   
irregularly, garish orange 

and livid blue. Is it 
fluorescent, do these stones   
        glow in the dark? 
Maybe. I only know 

they glow in the day, so   
vivid I stopped my car, 
        whereupon two others   
came inquiring also, two 

crows in the broken spars 
of the white pine tree, cawing   
        above the house. 
Why had those who inhabited 

this corner of poverty 
painted the stones? Was it   
        that the flowers 
in living bravery nevertheless 

made too meager a show 
for the ruined cliff? Or did they   
        think to bring art 
to nature, somehow to improve 

this corner of ugliness? 
For my part I thought how   
        these colors 
were beautiful and yet strange 

in their beauty, ugly colors,   
garish orange, livid blue;   
        they reminded me 
of those Spanish cemeteries 

I saw in New Mexico, tin   
mirrors and plastic flowers   
        in the desert. Then 
I knew why the stones 

had been painted: to make   
reparation, such as the poor 
      might make, whose sorrow   
had been done here, this 

desecration. Is not this 
the burden of all poor lands   
        everywhere, 
the basis of poverty? 

A spoiled land makes spoiled   
people. The poor know this.   
        I guess 
the crows know too, because off 

they flew, cawing above 
the bridge and the slashed hills   
        surrounding Morrisville.   
I started my car and drove 

out on the iron bridge   
which rumbled its sullen   
        affirmation. 
And I sang as I sing now 

(if you care to call it song)   
my people of Morrisville   
        who live 
where all the ends are wrong.

text : 
If you're one of seven 
Downfalls, up in your kingdom 
Of mulberry leaves, there are men 
Betting you aren't worth a bullet, 


That your skin won't tan into a good 
Wallet. As if drugged in the womb 
& limboed in a honeyed languor, 
By the time you open your eyes 


A thousand species have lived 
& died. Born on a Sunday 
Morning, with old-world algae 
In your long hair, a goodness 


Disguised your two-toed claws 
Bright as flensing knives. In this 
Upside-down haven, you're reincarnated 
As a fallen angel trying to go home.

title : Brief reflection on an old woman with a barrow

author : Miroslav Holub

Given an old woman and given a barrow. 
I.e. the system old woman O and barrow B. 

The system is moving from the paved yard Y to the corner C, 
    from the corner C to the Stone S, from the stone S 
    to the forest F, from the forest F to the horizon H. 

The horizon H is the point where vision ends 
    and memory begins. 

Nevertheless the system is moving 
    at a constant velocity v, 
    along a constant path, 
    through a constant destiny, 
renewing its impulse and its meaning 
    from within itself. 

A relatively independent system: 
in landscapes from horizon to horizon 
always just one old woman with a barrow. 

And thus we have, once and for all, 
    that geodetic unit, the 
    unit of travel there and back, the 
    unit of autumn, the 
    unit Our daily bread, the 
    unit of wind and lowering sky, the 
    unit of the distance home, the 
    unit As we forgive them, the 
    unit of nightfall, the 
    unit of footsteps and dust, the 
    unit of life-fulfillment Amen.

                              Red

Mupits’ breath, in moonlight, outside a child’s bedroom window

Hunter’s bones scattered on the prairie

Fragrance of Comanche gangstas who entered The Zoo Club
and assassinated the bosses of Underworld Seven,
a Navajo crime syndicate

Little Stoney Burgess’s footprints after catching ghost sickness
by running through Post Oak Cemetery chased
by snot-nosed bully, Blender Plenty Bear


                              Blue

Lips of the poisoned tribal chairman collapsed on the buffet table
at the 1974 Comanche Nation Inaugural Dinner

Silk handkerchief drawn over the stuffed owl used to converse 
with the dead

In the woods, it’s the laughter of Deer Woman as she stomps
her male victim to death

Electric guitar distortion of the Messiah playing Jimi Hendrix’s
Machine Gun as she strolls into the Indian bar


                               Yellow

Coyote’s eyes in the darkness of the backseat at midnight 
as you speed down Mt. Scott, on a dare, with the headlights off

Crushed buffalo kidney stones used in graffiti to magically
imprison the river-witch underneath the I-44 bridge

Intricate beadwork on Lucifer’s cane
left at the funnel cake stand at Comanche Fair

Flashing ignition light to the engines of the great abyss

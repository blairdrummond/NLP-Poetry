Welcome, rain or tempest 
                         From yon airy powers, 
                      We have languished for them 
                         Many sultry hours, 
And earth is sick and wan, and pines with all her flowers. 

                      What have they been doing 
                         In the burning June? 
                      Riding with the genii? 
                         Visiting the moon? 
Or sleeping on the ice amid an arctic noon? 

                      Bring they with them jewels 
                         From the sunset lands? 
                      What are these they scatter 
                         With such lavish hands? 
There are no brighter gems in Raolconda's sands. 

                      Pattering on the gravel, 
                         Dropping from the eaves, 
                      Glancing in the grass, and 
                         Tinkling on the leaves, 
They flash the liquid pearls as flung from fairy sieves. 

                      Meanwhile, unreluctant, 
                         Earth like Danae lies; 
                      Listen! is it fancy 
                         That beneath us sighs, 
As that warm lap receives the largesse of the skies? 

                      Jove, it is, descendeth 
                         In those crystal rills; 
                      And this world-wide tremor 
                         Is a pulse that thrills 
To a god's life infused through veins of velvet hills. 

                      Wait, thou jealous sunshine, 
                         Break not on their bliss; 
                      Earth will blush in roses 
                         Many a day for this, 
And bend a brighter brow beneath thy burning kiss.

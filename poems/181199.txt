title : Quaker Meeting, The Sixties

author : Robin Becker

text : 
Seeing my friend’s son in his broad-brimmed hat 
and suspenders, I think of the Quakers 
who lectured us on nonviolent social action 
every week when I was a child. In the classrooms 
we listened to those who would not take up arms, 
who objected, who had accepted alternative 
service in distant work camps and showed 
slides of hospitals they helped to build. 
On Wednesdays, in Meeting for Worship, 
when someone rose to speak, 
all the energy in the room 
flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell 
what she had seen on her brief 
encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable, 
a riddle, a kindness. The fall that we were seventeen, 
we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path 
from the Meetinghouse, while maple and elm 
leaves sailed around our shoulders   
like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside. 
Despite the war in Vietnam, I felt safer 
than I ever would again. Perhaps 
those aged, protective trees had cast a spell 
on us, or maybe the nonviolent Quaker God 
had set up a kingdom right there— 
suburban Philadelphia. Looking back, I see how 
good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic 
room for Latin, descended to the gym for sports, 
where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds 
of righteous behavior. We prepared to leave 
for college, armed with the language of the American 
Friends and the memories of Thanksgiving 
dinners we’d cooked for the unfortunates: 
borrowing our parents’ cars to drive 
downtown to the drop-off point, racing back 
to play our last field hockey match. Grim center forwards 
shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs’ 
knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.

title : The Rule

author : Shail D. Patel

text : 
Discipline. Free will 
Doesn't mean freewheel. 

But what about Eros?  Let 
Eros harrow whom he will. 

I have sipped my sip 
And poisoned the well. 

I am well pleased with my thirst. 
I know my thirst no evil. 

You'll die of thirst, Shail. 
If â€‰the salt sea wills.

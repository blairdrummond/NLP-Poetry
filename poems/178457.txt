title : The Egoist

author : William H. Dickey

text : 
Popped from the womb, he began gathering property   
extorted from his wet nurses by threatening 

to turn blue in the face and die. Everyone gave in. 
His mother dressed him in guava-colored lace crinolines 

his father obligingly retired to the Côte d’Azur 
siblings were disposed of by the Beast of the Bassinet. 

Coextensive with the world, his hands become The Hands,   
his mouth The Mouth, his dingus The Dingus. 

Absolute power corrupts absolutely said Lord Acton.   
Absolute corruption set in: a foot revolted 

and proclaimed democracy and universal male suffrage   
the hairs of his armpit began drinking heavily 

and all over his body an asexual budding 
produced nodes of himself, his genetic encumberment 

replicated and replicated, an oblique hysteria.   
The absolute corruption of self is community. 

The absolute corruption of the mouth 
is to taste its tongue over and over, to be continually filled.

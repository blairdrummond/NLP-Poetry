Love is and was my Lord and King, 
         And in his presence I attend 
         To hear the tidings of my friend, 
Which every hour his couriers bring. 

Love is and was my King and Lord, 
         And will be, tho' as yet I keep 
         Within his court on earth, and sleep 
Encompass'd by his faithful guard, 

And hear at times a sentinel 
         Who moves about from place to place, 
         And whispers to the worlds of space, 
In the deep night, that all is well.

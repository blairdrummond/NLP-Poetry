Fragment 10: The Three Sorts of Friends

Romantic
England
Friends & Enemies, Relationships, Men & Women

Epigram, Rhymed Stanza, Couplet

Though friendships differ endless in degree , 
The sorts , methinks, may be reduced to three. 
Ac quaintance many, and Con quaintance few; 
But for In quaintance I know only two-- 
The friend I've mourned with, and the maid I woo!

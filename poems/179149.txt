There was another life we knew each other   
We were poor and hungry we lived in a palace   
Cats supped in our place aloft we ate air 
Trees were our nursemaids the moss sang to us   
The door was heavy the reed gate was smashed   
We drove through smoke we rode in carriages   
We were far from the shore the ocean was near   
The sky was jute the wet earth gray ash 
We spoke in English in Russian we argued 
The moon wore a mask the sun mirrored its moods   
In the desert the thirsty went down to the water   
Hummingbirds swarmed lions roared in quarries   
Silence is an envelope noise is paper 
This is a story poems come after stories

title : Grandfather

author : Andrei Guruianu

text : 
Dead before I came into this world, grandfather, 
I carry your name, yet I've never met you. 
I hear my name, and know 
that somehow they refer to you. 
When I scribble those six letters 
fast, to sign some document 
or print them neatly in a box, 
I feel your presence flow with the ink 
stain and burn through the paper, 
forever imprinted in my mind. 
Late summer nights 
gathered around the dinner table, 
leftovers being cleared away, 
faces clouded in cigarette smoke, 
I hear voices pass the word 
back and forth in reverence. 
Somehow I know it's not me 
the little one grabbing for attention. 
They speak of you, Andrei, 
the one I've never met, 
whose name I carry.

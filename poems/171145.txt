title : Of Some Renown

author : Jean L. Connor

text : 
For some time now, I have 
lived anonymously. No one 
appears to think it odd. 
They think the old are, 
well, what they seem. Yet 
see that great egret 

at the marsh's edge, solitary, 
still? Mere pretense 
that stillness. His silence is 
a lie. In his own pond he is 
of some renown, a stalker, 
a catcher of fish. Watch him.

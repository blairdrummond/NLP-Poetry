title : For the South

I hate your hills white with dogwood 
or pink with redbud in spring 
as if you invented hope, as if 
in the middle of red clay, 
limestone outcroppings, 
and oak trees dead with fungus 
something slight and beautiful 
should make us smile. 

I hate the way honeysuckle drapes 
fences, blooms in the ditch   
where everyone dumps garbage; 
the evening air sweet with cedar 
and fields of burley; 
the way irises and buttercups 
mark the old dimensions of a house 
destroyed a hundred years ago; 
how a span of Queen Anne’s lace 
rocks the whole moon, and the sumac 
runs dark against the hill. 

I hate the drawl, the lazy voice 
saying I’ve been away so long 
I sound like I’m from nowhere; 
the old hand gathering snowballs or peonies 
or forking up an extra dish of greens, 
bitter, just the way I like them.

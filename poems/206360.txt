text : 
While the man is away    
telling his wife    
about the red-corseted woman,    
the woman waits    
on the queen-sized bed.    
You'd expect her quiet    
in the fist of a copper    
statue. Half her face,    
a shade of golden meringue,    
the other half, the dark    
of cattails. Her mouth even—    
too straight, as if she doubted    
her made decision, the way    
women do. In her hands,    
a yellow letter creased,    
like her hunched back.    
Her dress limp on a green chair.    
In front, a man's satchel    
and briefcase. On a dresser,    
a hat with a ceylon    
feather. That is all    
the artist left us with,    
knowing we would turn    
the woman's stone into ours,    
a thirst for the self    
in everything—even    
in the sweet chinks    
of mandarin.

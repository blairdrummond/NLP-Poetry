title : To the Blank Spaces

text : 
For longer than by now I can believe 
I assumed that you had nothing to do 
with each other I thought you had arrived 
                  whenever that had been 

more solitary than single snowflakes 
with no acquaintance or understanding 
running among you guiding your footsteps 
                  somewhere ahead of me 

in your own time oh white lakes on the maps 
that I copied and gaps on the paper 
for the names that were to appear in them 
                  sometimes a doorway or 

window sometimes an eye sometimes waking 
without knowing the place in the whole night 
I might have guessed from the order in which 
                  you turned up before me 

and from the way I kept looking at you 
as though I recognized something in you 
that you were all words out of one language 
                  tracks of the same creature

... between impulses and repentances, between advances and retreats.  —Octavio Paz, Eagle or Sun? 
Here I am 
posing in a mirror of scratch paper sonnets 
sonnets as rare 
as a live Aegean rhino 

absorbing the cracklings of my craft 
its riverine volcanoes 
its spectacular lightning peninsulas 
emitting plentiful creosote phantoms 
from an ironic blizzard of unsettled pleromas 

scouring through years of unrecognized pablums   
of constant arch-rivalry with extinction 
bringing up skulls of intensive discourse 
by the claws in one’s mind 
which seem to burn with systemic reduction 

one then suffers poetic scorching by debris   
by inaugural timber which flashes 
by friction which flares up & harries 
by unrecognized moltens collapsing in glass   
of initial intuitive neglect 

as if one’s fangs 
were fatally stifled by incipience 
by verbal range war didactics 
by territorial driftwood 
by sudden undemonstrative detractions   
awed 
by the diverse infernos of Trakl & Dante 

one’s youngish body stands 
devoured by reverential print trails 
momentarily cancelled 
by the loss of blasphemous nerves & upheaval   
stung 
by demeaning neutralities 
ravaged 
by a blank Sumatran solar psychosis 
by a tasteless collision of rums in transition   
by a conspiracy of obscured fertility by hubris 

as one sucks in doubt from a wave of tumbling blister trees 
there exists irradiations flecked with a gambled synecdoche 
with indeterminate earthenware splinters   
taking up 
from aboriginal density 
a forge of Sumerian verbal signs 
cooked with a tendency 
towards starfish hypnosis 
towards psychic confrontational drainage 
conducting one’s frictions in a torrential furnace of osmosis & ire 

yes 
apprenticeship 
means poetry scrawled in unremitting leper’s mosaic   
cringed in smoky interior cubicles 
releasing various deleriums 
as if pointed under a blackened Oedipal star   
with its dark incapable tints 
with its musical ruse of unspoken belladonna 

poetics 
an imaginal flash of Russian chamber lilies   
stretching under a blue marsupial sun   
like kaleidoscopic tumbleweed 
fugaciously transfixed 
upon an anomalous totem of glints 
upon rainy Buenos Aires transfusions 
above the urinal coppers of a flaming polar star rise 

of course 
kinetic 
like magical malachite rivers 
flowing from moons 
blowing through the 3/4 summits of motionless anginas 

I’ve looked 
for only the tonalities that scorch   
which bring to my lips wave after wave   
of sensitivity by virulence 

yes 
a merciless bitterness 
brewed by a blue-black tornado of verbs 
in a surge of flashing scorpion chatter 
in a dessicated storm of inferential parallels & voltage   
like a scattered igneous wind 
co-terminus with the bleeding hiatus & the resumption of breath 

resolved by flash point edicts   
by consumptive stellar limes 
by curvature in tense proto-Bretonian fatigue 

mixing magnets 
juggling centripetal anti-podes & infinities   
cracking the smoke of pure rupestral magentas 

yes 
hatcheries 
floating through acetylene corruption of practiced mental restraint   
to splendiferous vistas mingled with inspirational roulette   
its mysteriums 
always leaping like a grainy rash of scorching tarantellas   
or leaking moon spun alloestrophas* 
as if speaking 
in irregular glossological green Dutch 

a frenetic seminar on febricity 
a reitteration of hendecasyllabic agitation & stinging   
a ferocious vacillation 
explosive as random “aggregational” nodes 
mimed by a black consonantal dissection 
its maximal priority 
forked at “hypotactic inclusion” 
with isochronous internal procedure 
with ratios 
with phonic penetralia by distortion 
primed by anomalous “nuclear accent” 
by a cadence composing syllables & compounds 

yes 
poetics 
its force 
jettisoned by “hypotaxis”   
by ... paratactic co-ordination   
& fire

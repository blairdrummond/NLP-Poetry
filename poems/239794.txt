title : The Romance of Middle Age

author : Mary Meriam

text : 
Now that I’m fifty, let me take my showers 
at night, no light, eyes closed. And let me swim 
in cover-ups. My skin’s tattooed with hours 
and days and decades, head to foot, and slim 
is just a faded photograph. It’s strange 
how people look away who once would look. 
I didn’t know I’d undergo this change 
and be the unseen cover of a book 
whose plot, though swift, just keeps on getting thicker. 
One reaches for the pleasures of the mind 
and heart to counteract the loss of quicker 
knowledge. One feels old urgencies unwind, 
although I still pluck chin hairs with a tweezer, 
in case I might attract another geezer.

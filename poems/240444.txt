title : Now that I am Never Alone

author : Tess Gallagher

text : 
In the bath I look up and see the brown moth
 pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips
 against the white wall. I heat up
 the water, running as much hot in as I can stand.
 These handfuls over my shoulder—how once
 he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped
 a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring
 we were drinking from. Beautiful mischief
 that stills a moment so I can never look
 back. Only now, brightest now, and the water
 never hot enough to drive that shiver out.
  
 But I remember solitude—no other
 presence and each thing what it was. Not this raw
 fluttering I make of you as you have made of me
 your watch-fire, your killing light.

Green mwold on zummer bars do show
   That they've a-dripp'd in winter wet;
The hoof-worn ring o' groun' below
   The tree, do tell o' storms or het;
The trees in rank along a ledge
Do show where woonce did bloom a hedge;
An' where the vurrow-marks do stripe
The down, the wheat woonce rustled ripe.
Each mark ov things a-gone vrom view--
To eyezight's woone, to soulzight two.

The grass agean the mwoldren door
   'S a token sad o' vo'k a-gone,
An' where the house, bwoth wall an' vloor,
   'S a-lost, the well mid linger on.
What tokens, then, could Meary gi'e
That she'd a-liv'd, an' liv'd vor me,
But things a-done vor thought an' view?
Good things that nwone agean can do,
An' every work her love ha' wrought
To eyezight's woone, but two to thought.

This time we are getting drunk on retsina 
in somebody’s Italian backyard. We are a long way   
    from Georgia 
and all of us are lonely. I wave my arms 
and caw like Hadrian after his lover drowned himself.   
My wife walks by the pond singing a hymn;   
I think she is leaving me for good. I say, Imagine   
my heart is huge and has 
    little men 
walking around inside. They don’t know each other   
but they’re stuck there eternally 
and have to get along. One of them starts shouting;   
he finds a black horse and rides it around in a circle.   
The others laugh at him. He leaps from the horse and   
starts to choke the smallest man. Something like a hand 
    starts pumping the heart 
and the men nearly go crazy from the pressure.   
—The first olive I picked from a tree 
was so bitter I nearly threw up. My wife is strolling   
around this strange landscape full of broken pediments   
as if she plans to be happy from now on. I think   
I have to tense it up, act like I’m in control.   
I don’t think I can do that. In a few hours the sun will   
rise over my brother’s backyard in south Georgia.   
He’ll come out and admire the water jewels 
the night has hung in the kumquat bush. He’ll hear his son say, 
         ‘Mama, 
it’s too big for me to wear,’ and remember quitting the baseball team   
    thirty years ago 
and wish again he hadn’t. 
—I get up and march down to the pond. I start to speak   
    to my wife 
but then I feel a hand 
that is about to crush my heart.

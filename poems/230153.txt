title : Language of Love

There were distinctive 
dips and shivers 
in the various foliage, 
syncopated, 
almost cadenced in the way   
that once made him invent   
“understanding.” 

                         * 

Now the boss could say   
“parameters” 
and mean something   
like “I’ll pinch.” 

By repeating the gesture exactly   
the woman awakened 
an excited suspicion 
in the infant. 

When he awakened 
she was just returning from   
one of her little trips. 

It’s common to confuse 
the distance 
with flirtation: 
that expectant solemnity   
which seems to invite a kiss. 

                         * 

He stroked her carapace 
with his claw. 
They had developed a code 
in which each word appeared to refer   
to some abdicated function. 

Thus, in a department store,   
Petite Impressions might neighbor   
Town Square. 

But he exaggerated it 
by mincing 
words like “micturition,”   
setting scenes 
in which the dainty lover   
would pretend to leave. 

                         * 

Was it sadness or fear? 
He still wasn’t back. 
The act of identification, 
she recognized, 
was always a pleasure, 
but this lasting difference   
between sense and recognition   
made her unhappy 

or afraid. 
Once she was rewarded   
by the beams 
of headlights flitting   
in play.

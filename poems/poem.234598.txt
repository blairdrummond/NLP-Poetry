Elegy VII: Nature's lay idiot, I taught thee to love 
John Donne 
1572-1631
Renaissance
England




Nature's lay idiot, I taught thee to love, 
And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove 
Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand 
The mystic language of the eye nor hand: 
Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air 
Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair: 
Nor by the'eye's water call a malady 
Desperately hot, or changing feverously. 
I had not taught thee then, the alphabet 
Of flowers, how they devicefully being set 
And bound up, might with speechless secrecy 
Deliver errands mutely, and mutually. 
Remember since all thy words used to be 
To every suitor, "I, 'if my friends agree"; 
Since, household charms, thy husband's name to teach, 
Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach; 
And since, an hour's discourse could scarce have made 
One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed   
In broken proverbs, and torn sentences. 
Thou art not by so many duties his, 
That from the'world's common having severed thee, 
Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see, 
As mine: who have with amorous delicacies 
Refined thee'into a blissful paradise. 
Thy graces and good words my creatures be; 
I planted knowledge and life's tree in thee, 
Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas   
Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass? 
Chafe wax for others' seals? break a colt's force 
And leave him then, being made a ready horse?

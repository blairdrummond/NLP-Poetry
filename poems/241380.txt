title : Lost in the Hospital

It’s not that I don’t like the hospital.
 Those small bouquets of flowers, pert and brave.
 The smell of antiseptic cleansers.
 The ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true.
 My friend, the one who’s dying, took me out
 To where the patients go to smoke, IV’s
 And oxygen in tanks attached to them—
 A tiny patio for skeletons. We shared
 A cigarette, which was delicious but 
 Too brief. I held his hand; it felt
 Like someone’s keys. How beautiful it was,
 The sunlight pointing down at us, as if
 We were important, full of life, unbound.
 I wandered for a moment where his ribs
 Had made a space for me, and there, beside 
 The thundering waterfall of his heart,
 I rubbed my eyes and thought, “I’m lost.”

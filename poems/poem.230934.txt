Sonnet

By such an all-embalming summer day 
As sweetens now among the mountain pines 
Down to the cornland yonder and the vines, 
To where the sky and sea are mixed in gray, 
How do all things together take their way 
Harmonious to the harvest, bringing wines 
And bread and light and whatsoe'er combines 
In the large wreath to make it round and gay. 
To me my troubled life doth now appear 
Like scarce distinguishable summits hung 
Around the blue horizon: places where 
Not even a traveller purposeth to steer,-- 
Whereof a migrant bird in passing sung, 
And the girl closed her window not to hear.

title : Fragment 1: Sea-ward, white gleaming thro' the busy scud

author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge

text : 

Sea-ward, white gleaming thro' the busy scud
With arching Wings, the sea-mew o'er my head
Posts on, as bent on speed, now passaging
Edges the stiffer Breeze, now, yielding, drifts,
Now floats upon the air, and sends from far
A wildly-wailing Note.

Wrapped in gold foil, in the search
 and shouting of Easter Sunday,
 it was the ball of the princess,
 it was Pharoah’s body
 sleeping in its golden case.
 At the foot of the picket fence,
 in grass lank with the morning rain,
 it was a Sunday school prize,
 silver for second place, gold
 for the triumphant little dome
 of Ararat, and my sister
 took me by the hand and led me
 out onto the wide, wet lawn
 and showed me to bend into the thick nests
 of grass, into the darkest green.
 Later I had to give it back,
 in exchange for a prize,
 though I would rather have kept the egg.
 What might have coiled inside it?
 Crocuses tight on their clock-springs,
 a bird who’d sing himself into an angel
 in the highest reaches of the garden,
 the morning’s flaming arrow?
 Any small thing can save you.
 Because the golden egg gleamed
 in my basket once, though my childhood
 became an immense sheet of darkening water
 I was Noah, and I was his ark,
 and there were two of every animal inside me.

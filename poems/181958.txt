The angel — 
three years we waited for him, attention riveted, 
closely scanning 
the pines the shore the stars. 
One with the blade of the plough or the ship’s keel 
we were searching to find once more the first seed 
so that the age-old drama could begin again. 

We returned to our homes broken, 
limbs incapable, mouths cracked 
by the tastes of rust and brine. 
when we woke we traveled towards the north, strangers 
plunged into mist by the immaculate wings of swans that wounded us. 
On winter nights the strong wind from the east maddened us, 
in the summers we were lost in the agony of days that couldn’t die. 

We brought back 
these carved reliefs of a humble art.

Still one more well inside a cave. 
It used to be easy for us to draw up idols and ornaments 
to please those friends who still remained loyal to us. 

The ropes have broken; only the grooves on the well’s lip 
remind us of our past happiness: 
the fingers on the rim, as the poet put it. 
The fingers feel the coolness of the stone a little, 
Then the body’s fever prevails over it 
and the cave stakes its soul and loses it 
every moment, full of silence, without a drop of water.

                        Remember the baths where you were murdered 

I woke with this marble head in my hands; 
it exhausts my elbow and I don’t know where to put it down. 
It was falling into the dream as I was coming out of the dream 
so our life became one and it will be very difficult for it to separate again. 

I look at the eyes: neither open nor closed 
I speak to the mouth which keeps trying to speak 
I hold the cheeks which have broken through the skin. 
That’s all I’m able to do. 

My hands disappear and come towards me 
mutilated.

                                                                     Argonauts 

And a soul 
if it is to know itself 
must look 
into its own soul: 
the stranger and enemy, we’ve seen him in the mirror. 

They were good, the companions, they didn’t complain 
about the work or the thirst or the frost, 
they had the bearing of trees and waves 
that accept the wind and the rain 
accept the night and the sun 
without changing in the midst of change. 
They were fine, whole days 
they sweated at the oars with lowered eyes 
breathing in rhythm 
and their blood reddened a submissive skin. 
Sometimes they sang, with lowered eyes 
as we were passing the deserted island with the Barbary figs 
to the west, beyond the cape of the dogs 
that bark. 
If it is to know itself, they said 
it must look into its own soul, they said 
and the oar’s struck the sea’s gold 
in the sunset. 
We went past many capes many islands the sea 
leading to another sea, gulls and seals. 
Sometimes disconsolate women wept 
lamenting their lost children 
and others frantic sought Alexander the Great 
and glories buried in the depths of Asia. 

We moored on shores full of night-scenes, 
the birds singing, with waters that left on the hands 
the memory of a great happiness. 
But the voyages did not end. 
Their souls became one with the oars and the oarlocks 
with the solemn face of the prow 
with the rudder’s wake 
with the water that shattered their image. 
The companions died one by one, 
with lowered eyes. Their oars 
mark the place where they sleep on the shore. 

No one remembers them. Justice

We didn’t know them 
                                                 deep down it was hope that said 
we’d known them since early childhood. 
We saw them perhaps twice and then they took to the ships: 
cargoes of coal, cargoes of grain, and our friends 
lost beyond the ocean forever. 
Dawn finds us beside the tired lamp 
drawing on paper, awkwardly, painfully, 
ships mermaids or sea shells; 
at dusk we go down to the river 
because it shows us the way to the sea; 
and we spend the nights in cellars that smell of tar. 

Our friends have left us 
                                                      perhaps we never saw them, perhaps 
we met them when sleep 
still brought us close to the breathing wave 
perhaps we search for them because we search for the other life, 
beyond the statues.

                                                                           M.R. 

The garden with its fountains in the rain 
you will see only from behind the clouded glass 
of the low window. Your room 
will be lit only by the flames from the fireplace 
and sometimes the distant lightning will reveal 
the wrinkles on your forehead, my old Friend. 

The garden with the fountains that in your hands 
was a rhythm of the other life, beyond the broken 
statues and the tragic columns 
and a dance among the oleanders 
near the new quarries — 
misty glass will have cut it off from your life. 
You won’t breathe; earth and the sap of the trees 
will spring from your memory to strike 
this window struck by rain 
from the outside world.

                                                             South wind 

Westward the sea merges with a mountain range. 
From our left the south wind blows and drives us mad, 
the kind of wind that strips bones of their flesh. 
Our house among pines and carobs. 
Large windows. Large tables 
for writing you the letters we’ve been writing 
so many months now, dropping them 
into the space between us in order to fill it up. 

Star of dawn, when you lowered your eyes 
our hours were sweeter than oil 
on a wound, more joyful than cold water 
to the palate, more peaceful than a swan’s wings. 
You held our life in the palm of your hand. 
After the bitter bread of exile, 
at night if we remain in front of the white wall 
your voice approaches us like the hope of fire; 
and again this wind hones 
a razor against our nerves. 

Each of us writes you the same thing 
and each falls silent in the other’s presence, 
watching, each of us, the same world separately 
the light and darkness on the mountain range 
and you. 
Who will lift this sorrow from our hearts? 
Yesterday evening a heavy rain and again today 
the covered sky burdens us. Our thoughts – 
like the pine needles of yesterday’s downpour 
bunched up and useless in front of our doorway — 
would build a collapsing tower. 

Among these decimated villages 
on this promontory, open to the south wind 
with the mountain range in front of us hiding you, 
who will appraise for us the sentence to oblivion? 
Who will accept our offering, at this close of autumn?

What are they after, our souls, travelling 
on the decks of decayed ships 
crowded in with sallow women and crying babies 
unable to forget themselves either with the flying fish 
or with the stars that the masts point our at their tips; 
grated by gramophone records 
committed to non-existent pilgrimages unwillingly 
murmuring broken thoughts from foreign languages. 

What are they after, our souls, travelling 
on rotten brine-soaked timbers 
from harbour to harbour? 

Shifting broken stones, breathing in 
the pine’s coolness with greater difficulty each day, 
swimming in the waters of this sea 
and of that sea, 
without the sense of touch 
without men 
in a country that is no longer ours 
nor yours. 

We knew that the islands were beautiful 
somewhere round about here where we grope, 
slightly lower down or slightly higher up, 
a tiny space. 



             9 

The harbour is old, I can’t wait any longer 
for the friend who left the island with the pine trees 
for the friend who left the island with the plane trees 
for the friend who left for the open sea. 
I stroke the rusted cannons, I stroke the oars 
so that my body may revive and decide. 
The sails give off only the smell 
of salt from the other storm. 

If I chose to remain alone, what I longed for 
was solitude, not this kind of waiting, 
my soul shattered on the horizon, 
these lines, these colours, this silence. 

The night’s stars take me back to Odysseus, 
to his anticipation of the dead among the asphodels. 
When we moored here we hoped to find among the asphodels 
the gorge that knew the wounded Adonis. 



             10 

Our country is closed in, all mountains 
that day and night have the low sky as their roof. 
We have no rivers, we have no wells, we have no springs, 
only a few cisterns — and these empty — that echo, and that we worship. 
A stagnant hollow sound, the same as our loneliness 
the same as our love, the same as our bodies. 
We find it strange that once we were able to build 
our houses, huts and sheep-folds. 
And our marriages, the cool coronals and the fingers, 
become enigmas inexplicable to our soul. 
How were our children born, how did they grow strong? 

Our country is closed in. The two black Symplegades 
close it in. When we go down 
to the harbours on Sunday to breathe freely 
we see, lit in the sunset, 
the broken planks from voyages that never ended, 
bodies that no longer know how to love. 



             11 

Sometimes your blood froze like the moon 
in the limitless night your blood 
spread its white wings over 
the black rocks, the shapes of trees and houses, 
with a little light from our childhood years. 



             12 

                                                                         Bottle in the sea 

Three rocks, a few burnt pines, a lone chapel 
and farther above 
the same landscape repeated starts again: 
three rocks in the shape of a gateway, rusted, 
a few burnt pines, black and yellow, 
and a square hut buried in whitewash; 
and still farther above, many times over, 
the same landscape recurs level after level 
to the horizon, to the twilit sky. 

Here we moored the ship to splice the broken oars, 
to drink water and to sleep. 
The sea that embittered us is deep and unexplored 
and unfolds a boundless calm. 
Here among the pebbles we found a coin 
and threw dice for it. 
The youngest won it and disappeared. 

We put to sea again with our broken oars. 



             13 

                                                                         Hydra 

Dolphins banners and the sound of cannons. 
The sea once so bitter to your soul 
bore the many-coloured and glittering ships 
it swayed, rolled and tossed them, all blue with white wings, 
once so bitter to your soul 
now full of colours in the sun. 

White sails and sunlight and wet oars 
struck with a rhythm of drums on stilled waves. 

Your eyes, watching, would be beautiful, 
your arms, reaching out, would glow, 
your lips would come alive, as they used to, 
at such a miracle: 
that’s what you were looking for 
                                           what were you looking for in front of ashes 
or in the rain in the fog in the wind 
even when the lights were growing dim 
and the city was sinking and on the stone pavement 
the Nazarene showed you his heart, 
what were you looking for? why don’t you come? what were you looking for? 



             14 

Three red pigeons in the light 
inscribing our fate in the light 
with colours and gestures of people 
we once loved. 



             15 

                                                             Quid πλατανων opacissimus 

Sleep wrapped you in green leaves like a tree 
you breathed like a tree in the quiet light 
in the limpid spring I looked at your face: 
eyelids closed, eyelashes brushing the water. 
In the soft grass my fingers found your fingers 
I held your pulse a moment 
and felt elsewhere your heart’s pain. 

Under the plane tree, near the water, among laurel 
sleep moved you and scattered you 
around me, near me, without my being able to touch the whole of you — 
one as you were with your silence; 
seeing your shadow grow and diminish, 
lose itself in the other shadows, in the other 
world that let you go yet held you back. 

The life that they gave us to live, we lived. 
Pity those who wait with such patience 
lost in the black laurel under the heavy plane trees 
and those, alone, who speak to cisterns and wells 
and drown in the voice’s circles. 
Pity the companion who shared our privation and our sweat 
and plunged into the sun like a crow beyond the ruins, 
without hope of enjoying our reward. 

Give us, outside sleep, serenity.

                                                                         The name is Orestes 

On the track, once more on the track, on the track, 
how many times around, how many blood-stained laps, how many black 
rows; the people who watch me, 
who watched me when, in the chariot, 
I raised my hand glorious, and they roared triumphantly. 

The froth of the horses strikes me, when will the horses tire? 
The axle creaks, the axle burns, when will the axle burst into flame? 
When will the reins break, when will the hooves 
tread flush on the ground 
on the soft grass, among the poppies 
where, in the spring, you picked a daisy. 
They were lovely, your eyes, but you didn’t know where to look 
nor did I know where to look, I, without a country, 
I who go on struggling here, how many times around? 
and I feel my knees give way over the axle 
over the wheels, over the wild track 
knees buckle easily when the gods so will it, 
no one can escape, what use is strength, you can’t 
escape the sea that cradled you and that you search for 
at this time of trial, with the horses panting, 
with the reeds that used to sing in autumn to the Lydian mode 
the sea you cannot find no matter how you run 
no matter how you circle past the black, bored Eumenides,   
unforgiven.

                                                                               Astyanax 

Now that you are leaving, take the boy with you as well, 
the boy who saw the light under the plane tree, 
one day when trumpets resounded and weapons shone 
and the sweating horses 
bent to the trough to touch with wet nostrils 
the green surface of the water. 

The olive trees with the wrinkles of our fathers 
the rocks with the wisdom of our fathers 
and our brother’s blood alive on the earth 
were a vital joy, a rich pattern 
for the souls who knew their prayer. 

Now that you are leaving, now that the day of payment 
dawns, now that no one knows 
whom he will kill and how he will die, 
take with you the boy who saw the light 
under the leaves of that plane tree 
and teach him to study the trees. 



             18 

I regret having let a broad river slip through my fingers 
without drinking a single drop. 
Now I’m sinking into the stone. 
A small pine tree in the red soil 
is all the company I have. 
Whatever I loved vanished with the houses 
that were new last summer 
and crumbled in the winds of autumn. 



             19 

Even if the wind blows it doesn’t cool us 
and the shade is meagre under the cypress trees 
and all around slopes ascending to the mountains; 

they’re a burden for us 
the friends who no longer know how to die. 



             20 

In my breast the wound opens again 
when the stars descend and become kin to my body 
when silence falls under the footsteps of men. 

These stones sinking into time, how far will they drag me with them? 
The sea, the sea, who will be able to drain it dry? 
I see the hands beckon each drawn to the vulture and the hawk 
bound as I am to the rock that suffering has made mine, 
I see the trees breathing the black serenity of the dead 
and then the smiles, so static, of the statues. 



             21 

We who set out on this pilgrimage 
looked at the broken statues 
became distracted and said that life is not so easily lost 
that death has unexplored paths 
and its own particular justice; 

that while we, still upright on our feet, are dying, 
affiliated in stone 
united in hardness and weakness, 
the ancient dead have escaped the circle and risen again 
and smile in a strange silence. 



             22 

So very much having passed before our eyes 
that even our eyes saw nothing, but beyond 
and behind was memory like the white sheet one night in an enclosure 
where we saw strange visions, even stranger than you, 
pass by and vanish into the motionless foliage of a pepper tree; 

having known this fate of ours so well 
wandering among broken stones, three or six thousand years 
searching in collapsed buildings that might have been our homes 
trying to remember dates and heroic deeds: 
will we be able? 

having been bound and scattered, 
having struggled, as they said, with non-existent difficulties 
lost, then finding again a road full of blind regiments 
sinking in marshes and in the lake of Marathon, 
will we be able to die as we should? 



             23 

A little farther 
we will see the almond trees blossoming 
the marble gleaming in the sun 
the sea breaking into waves 

a little farther, 
let us rise a little higher. 



             24 

Here end the works of the sea, the works of love. 
Those who will some day live here where we end — 
should the blood happen to darken in their memory and overflow — 
let them not forget us, the weak souls among the asphodels, 
let them turn the heads of the victims towards Erebus: 

We who had nothing will school them in serenity.

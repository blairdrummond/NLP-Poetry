title : National Insecurity

author : Tomas Transtr√∂mer

text : 
The Under Secretary leans forward and draws an X 
and her ear-drops dangle like swords of Damocles. 

As a mottled butterfly is invisible against the ground 
so the demon merges with the opened newspaper. 

A helmet worn by no one has taken power. 
The mother-turtle flees flying under the water.

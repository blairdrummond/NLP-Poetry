title : Contributions to a Rudimentary Concept of Nation

On the volatile nights of a winter
 nature corroborates with magnanimity
 a Cuban is in training for amusement or amnesia,
 so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
 he brings candy to God, he cultivates the vernacular, he fights off
 cirrhosis with fruit poached in syrup, he conducts business;
 thus research has shown that The Cuban is resourceful. 
 In the weighty choreographies of a summer
 nature authorizes already with suspicion
 a Cuban meets the ocean with offerings and harpoons,
 so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
 he finger-counts the casualties, he commits an infraction
 he slides his hands into his pockets, he avows and commits;
 thus analysis has shown that The Cuban is inspired. 
 Let’s attend the improbable territory
 where with pasty mouths a Cuban and The Cuban engage in virile 
 conversation
 we will learn there by what voyage, by what strange condition
 by what exchange
 we fall prey to so much ingenuity.

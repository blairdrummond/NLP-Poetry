title : Timbre

text : 
I can’t tell you I had climbed for hours on
 ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth.
  
 My hands negotiating 
 through the teeth of the palisade
 lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies.
  
 And I can’t tell you that I came
 onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof,
 ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water.
  
 Feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight
 a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood.
  
 The opposite end of root
 speaking for its entirety through 
 silence and color.
  
 And I wish I could tell you that at the moment
 I met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone
 your name appeared in my throat with clarity.
  
 And I wish we were old
 and in front of a grand painting,
 a picture or postcard of 
 Picasso’s “Guernica” perhaps.
 It would be then that I would tell you
 Picasso once said that it took him his entire life
 to learn how to paint like a child.
  
 It would be through these words
 that would make you understand
 the same clarity that pooled over me
 on that ledge those years before
 when as a young man I extended 
 like direction, like timbre itself
 for a dying song that echoed your name.

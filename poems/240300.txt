title : Storm Ending

author : Jean Toomer

text : 
Thunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads,
Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,
Rumbling in the wind,
Stretching clappers to strike our ears . . .
Full-lipped flowers
Bitten by the sun
Bleeding rain
Dripping rain like golden honeyâ€”
And the sweet earth flying from the thunder.

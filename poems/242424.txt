title : This Most Perfect Hill

On this most perfect hill
 with these most perfect dogs
 are these most perfect people
 and this most perfect fog
  
 In this most perfect fog
 that is the middle of the sea
 inside the perfect middle of
 the things inside that swing
  
 In this most perfect rhyme
 that takes up what it sees,
 with perfect shelter from the 
 rain as perfect as can be,
  
 In this most perfect day
 at the apex of the sun
 runs this most perfect
 frog song that is roiling
 from the mud
  
 In these most perfect habits
 of the waving of the trees,
 through this imperfect language
 rides a perfect brilliancy.

title : First turn to me. . . .

First turn to me after a shower, 
you come inside me sideways as always 

in the morning you ask me to be on top of you,   
then we take a nap, we’re late for school 

you arrive at night inspired and drunk,   
there is no reason for our clothes 

we take a bath and lie down facing each other,   
then later we turn over, finally you come 

we face each other and talk about childhood 
as soon as I touch your penis I wind up coming 

you stop by in the morning to say hello 
we sit on the bed indian fashion not touching 

in the middle of the night you come home   
from a nightclub, we don’t get past the bureau 

next day it’s the table, and after that the chair 
because I want so much to sit you down & suck your cock 

you ask me to hold your wrists, but then when I   
touch your neck with both my hands you come 

it’s early morning and you decide to very quietly   
come on my knee because of the children 

you’ve been away at school for centuries, your girlfriend   
has left you, you come four times before morning 

you tell me you masturbated in the hotel before you came by   
I don’t believe it, I serve the lentil soup naked 

I massage your feet to seduce you, you are reluctant,   
my feet wind up at your neck and ankles 

you try not to come too quickly   
also, you dont want to have a baby 

I stand up from the bath, you say turn around   
and kiss the backs of my legs and my ass 

you suck my cunt for a thousand years, you are weary   
at last I remember my father’s anger and I come 

you have no patience and come right away 
I get revenge and won’t let you sleep all night 

we make out for so long we can’t remember how   
we wound up hitting our heads against the wall 

I lie on my stomach, you put one hand under me   
and one hand over me and that way can love me 

you appear without notice and with flowers   
I fall for it and we become missionaries 

you say you can only fuck me up the ass when you are drunk   
so we try it sober in a room at the farm 

we lie together one night, exhausted couplets 
and don’t make love. does this mean we’ve had enough? 

watching t.v. we wonder if each other wants to   
interrupt the plot; later I beg you to read to me 

like the Chinese we count 81 thrusts   
then 9 more out loud till we both come 

I come three times before you do 
and then it seems you’re mad and never will 

it’s only fair for a woman to come more   
think of all the times they didn’t care

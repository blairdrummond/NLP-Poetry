Green is the color of everything
 that isn’t brown, the tones ranging
 like mountains, the colors changing.
  
 You look up toward the hills & fog—
 the familiarity of it after so many years
           a resident tourist.
  
                                                    A young man walks
 toward you in vague streetcrossing denims
 & pronounced boots. From the pallor of
           his gait, the orange splotch twin gobs of sunset
           in his shades, from the way he vibrates
           his surrounding air, you can tell, you can tell
                     he’s friendly, circulating,
  
                                     he’s a Californian: comes to visit,
                               stays for years, marries, moves a wife in,
                          kids, wears out TV sets, get stranded on
                                                 loneliness,
                                         afternoon pharmaceutica,
                                so that the sky’s got moon in it by
                                     3 o’clock, is blooo, is blown—
                           
                                                                 The girls: theyre all
                                         winners reared by grandmothers & CBS.
  
                                    Luckier ones get in a few dances with 
                                 mom, a few hours, before dad goes back
                             in the slam, before “G’bye I’m off
                                      to be a singer!” & another runaway
                                          Miss American future drifts
                                               over the mountain &
                                                    into the clouds.
  
                                                    Still
             there’s a beautifulness about California.
 It’s based on the way each eyeblink toward
 the palms & into the orange grove leads backstage
                      into the onionfields.
  
 Unreachable, winter happens inside you.
  
 Your unshaded eyes dilate at the spectacle.
  
 You take trips to contain the mystery.

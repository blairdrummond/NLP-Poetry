seventy wingbeats
 per second
  
 vagaries of vegetation, rosy
 anticipation I
 turn the page without 
 reading
  
 essence of
 accident
  
 what is the strongest
 motive what
 drives the solar wind
  
 time’s not so
 old, dating only
 from the creation
  
 New England has 
 cooled significantly, icy
 core with a sooty coating
  
 this ice
 hard to break—the brain
 will have to wait
  
 catharsis of the 
 vulture, obligatory
 vespers
  
 a bat, painted the
 color of joy, head
 downward because
  
 the brain is
 heavy I put on 
 music but don’t always
 listen
  
whether magma could
 rise to where tones reach
 audible frequencies
  
 modest success with a late
 parasitic moth we will soon
  
 find out if all this
 is true
  
 sudden drain on the 
 heart, more
 doubt, the big
  
 melt: anything
 gone is
 replaced

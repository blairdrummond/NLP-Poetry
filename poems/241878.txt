title : October

author : Bobbi Katz

text : 
October is
 when night guzzles up
 the orange sherbet sunset
 and sends the day
 to bed
 before supper
             and
 October is when jack-o’-lanterns
 grin in the darkness
             and
             strange company crunches
 across the rumple of dry leaves
 to ring a doorbell.
 October is
 when you can be ghost,
             a witch,
                         a creature from outer space…
 almost anything!
 And the neighbors, fearing tricks,
             give you treats.

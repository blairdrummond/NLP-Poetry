title : Precision German Craftsmanship

It was a good day and I was about to do something important
 and good, but then I unscrewed the pen I was using
 to see the ink. Precision German craftsmanship.
 The Germans are so persnickety and precise,
 they wash their driveways. Their mountains and streams
 dance around each other in a clockwork, courtly imitation
 of spring. They build the Panzer tank, out of rakes
 hoses and garden gnomes; they built me.
 And I’ve seated myself above an avenue on the brink
 of mystery, always just on the lip, with my toes over the lip
 but my bowels behind.
  
 When I replaced the ink the sky was socked in,
 only one window of blue open in the north, directly over someone.
 But that person was reading about Rosicrucians in the laundromat,
 he was unaware as the blue window closed above him.
 The rest of us are limp and damp,
 I see a button in front of us that says “spin cycle.”
 I’m going to push it.

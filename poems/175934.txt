title : Your Shakespeare

author : Marvin Bell

text : 
If I am sentenced not to talk to you, 
and you are sentenced not to talk to me, 
then we wear the clothes of the desert   
serving that sentence, we are the leaves   
trampled underfoot, not even fit to be   
ground in for food, then we are the snow. 

If you are not what I take you to be, 
and I am not what you take me to be, 
then we are the glass the bridegroom smashes,   
the lost tribes underfoot, no one sees, 
no one can speak to us, in such seas we 
drift in we cannot be saved, we are the rain. 

If I am unable to help myself, 
and you are unable to help yourself, 
then anything will happen but nothing follows,   
we eat constantly but nothing satisfies. 
We live, finally, on the simplest notions: 
bits of glass in the head’s reticent weather.

Small Prayer 
Weldon Kees 
1914-1955


Living, Sorrow & Grieving, Religion, The Spiritual

Rhymed Stanza

Change, move, dead clock, that this fresh day
May break with dazzling light to these sick eyes.
Burn, glare, old sun, so long unseen,
That time may find its sound again, and cleanse
Whatever it is that a wound remembers
After the healing ends.

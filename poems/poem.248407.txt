Refrain, Terza Rima

"I cannot quite remember.... There were five
 Dropt dead beside me in the trench--and three
 Whispered their dying messages to me...."

 Back from the trenches, more dead than alive,
 Stone-deaf and dazed, and with a broken knee,
 He hobbled slowly, muttering vacantly:

 "I cannot quite remember.... There were five
 Dropt dead beside me in the trench, and three
 Whispered their dying messages to me....

 "Their friends are waiting, wondering how they thrive--
 Waiting a word in silence patiently....
 But what they said, or who their friends may be

 "I cannot quite remember.... There where five
 Dropt dead beside me in the trench--and three
 Whispered their dying messages to me...."

Queen Lydia Kamakaeha Lili'uokalani 
1838-1917


Nature, Trees & Flowers



Listen, Sanoe 
Dewy lehua bud 
Here I am 
Waiting for your voice. 

The answer comes
I am satisfied 
Softly, sweetheart 
You excite my whole being. 

My body is waiting 
Waiting there in yearning belief 
How are we to fulfill 
The desire of our thoughts? 

Calling to you, my water lily 
Budding for the two of us 
Here close by is a compliment 
The manu comes to deliver. 

The Queen is listening 
The aroma of the scents comes together 
Mixes and rises upward 
So similar, so alike.

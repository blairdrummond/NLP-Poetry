title : You That I Loved

author : A. F. Moritz

text : 
You that I loved all my life long, 
you are not the one. 
You that I followed, my line or path or way, 
that I followed singing, and you 
earth and air of the world the way went through, 
and you who stood around it so it could be 
the way, you forests and cities, 
you deer and opossums struck by the lonely hunter 
and left decaying, you paralyzed obese ones 
who sat on a falling porch in a deep green holler 
and observed me, your bald dog barking, 
as I stumbled past in a hurry along my line, 
you are not the one. But you 
are the one, you that I loved all my life long, 
you I still love so in my dying mind 
I grasp me loving you when we are gone. 
You are the one, you path or way or line 
that winds beside the house where she and I live on, 
still longing though long gone 
for the health of all forests and cities, 
and one day to visit them, 
one day be rich and free enough to go and see 
the restricted wonders of the earth. 
And you are the one, old ladies fated from birth 
to ugliness, obesity and dearth, 
who sat beside my path 
one day as I flashed by. And you are the one, 
all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills 
and animals the car on the road kills 
and leaves stinking in the sun.

(September 19, 1939)
This morning Hitler spoke in Danzig, we heard his voice. 
A man of genius: that is, of amazing 
Ability, courage, devotion, cored on a sick child's soul, 
Heard clearly through the dog-wrath, a sick child 
Wailing in Danzig; invoking destruction and wailing at it. 
Here, the day was extremely hot; about noon 
A south wind like a blast from hell's mouth spilled a slight rain 
On the parched land, and at five a light earthquake   
Danced the house, no harm done. To-night I have been amusing myself 
Watching the blood-red moon droop slowly   
Into black sea through bursts of dry lightning and distant thunder. 
Well: the day is a poem: but too much 
Like one of Jeffers's, crusted with blood and barbaric omens, 
Painful to excess, inhuman as a hawk's cry.

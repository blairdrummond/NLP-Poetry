Common Measure, Rhymed Stanza

No doubt to-morrow I will hide 
My face from you, my King. 
Let me rejoice this Sunday noon, 
And kneel while gray priests sing. 

It is not wisdom to forget. 
But since it is my fate 
Fill thou my soul with hidden wine 
To make this white hour great. 

My God, my God, this marvelous hour 
I am your son I know. 
Once in a thousand days your voice 
Has laid temptation low.

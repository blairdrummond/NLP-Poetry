title : Older, Younger, Both

author : Joyce Sutphen

text : 
I feel older, younger, both 
at once. Every time I win, 
I lose. Every time I count, 
I forget and must begin again. 

I must begin again, and again I 
must begin. Every time I lose, 
I win and must begin again. 

Everything I plan must wait, and 
having to wait has made me old, and 
the older I get, the more I wait, and everything 
I’m waiting for has already been planned. 

I feel sadder, wiser, neither 
together. Everything is almost 
true, and almost true is everywhere. 
I feel sadder, wiser, neither at once. 

I end in beginning, in ending I find 
that beginning is the first thing to do. 
I stop when I start, but my heart keeps on beating, 
so I must go on starting in spite of the stopping. 

I must stop my stopping and start to start— 
I can end at the beginning or begin at the end. 
I feel older, younger, both at once.

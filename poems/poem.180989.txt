Rhymed Stanza

Hot sun, cool fire, tempered with sweet air, 
Black shade, fair nurse, shadow my white hair. 
Shine, sun; burn, fire; breathe, air, and ease me; 
Black shade, fair nurse, shroud me and please me. 
Shadow, my sweet nurse, keep me from burning; 
Make not my glad cause cause of mourning. 
    Let not my beauty's fire 
    Inflame unstaid desire, 
    Nor pierce any bright eye 
    That wandereth lightly.

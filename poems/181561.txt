title : The Project of Linear Inquiry

[Let a be taken as . . .] 
a liquid line beneath the skin 
and b where the blue tiles meet 
body and the body’s bridge 
a seeming road here, endless 

rain pearling light 
chamber after chamber 
of dust-weighted air 
the project of seeing things 
so to speak, or things seen 

namely a hand, namely 
the logic of the hand 
holding a bell or clouded lens 
the vase perched impossibly near the edge 
obscuring the metal tines. 

She said “perhaps” then it echoed. 
I stood there torn 
felt hat in hand 
wondering what I had done 
to cause this dizziness 

“you must learn to live with.” 
It reveals no identifiable source 
(not anyway the same as a forest floor). 
A vagrant march time, car 
passes silently, arm rests at his side 

holding a bell or ground lens 
where c stands for inessential night – 
how that body would 
move vs how it actually does – 
too abstract &/or not abstract enough 

but a closed curve in either case 
she might repeat 
indicating the shallow eaves 
nothing but coats and scarves below the window 
his-her face canted to the left 

nothing imagined or imaginable 
dark and nothing actually begun 
so that the color becomes exactly as it was 
in the miniuscule word for it 
scribbled beside an arrow 

on the far wall 
perfectly how else continuous with memory. 
There are pomegranates on the table 
though they have been placed there 
salt, pepper, books and schedules 

all sharing the same error 
and measure of inattention. 
What she says rolls forward. 
I shouted toward motion, other gestured, 
child laughs, sky, 

traffic, photograph. I 
gave a real pain, expelled 
breath, decided. Both arms in thought, 
mirror otherwise, abandoned 
structures mostly, the glass 

door with its inscription lay open 
before us, nothing to fear.

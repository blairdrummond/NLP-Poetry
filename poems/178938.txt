title : Driving Through

author : Mark Vinz

text : 
This could be the town you’re from, 
marked only by what it’s near. 
The gas station man speaks of weather 
and the high school football team 
just as you knew he would— 
kind to strangers, happy to live here. 

Tell yourself it doesn’t matter now, 
you’re only driving through. 
Past the sagging, empty porches 
locked up tight to travelers’ stares, 
toward the great dark of the fields, 
your headlights startle a flock of 
old love letters—still undelivered, 
enroute for years.

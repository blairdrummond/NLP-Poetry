Rhymed Stanza

Nay, Doll, quoth Roger, now you're caught, 
     I'll never let you go
Till you consent, --To what? says Doll,
     Zounds, Doll, why, do'stn't know? 
She faintly screamed, and vowed she would
     If hurt, cry out aloud; 
Ne'er fear, says he, then seized the fair,
     She sighed--and sighed--and vowed,--
A'nt I a Man, quoth Roger, ha!
     Me you need never doubt,
Now did I hurt you, Doll? quoth he,
     Or, pray? says Doll, did I cry out?

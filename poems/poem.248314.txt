Quatrain, Rhymed Stanza

I love roads:
The goddesses that dwell
Far along invisible
Are my favorite gods.
?
Roads go on
While we forget, and are
Forgotten like a star
That shoots and is gone.
?
On this earth 'tis sure
We men have not made             
Anything that doth fade
So soon, so long endure:
?
The hill road wet with rain
In the sun would not gleam
Like a winding stream
If we trod it not again.
?
They are lonely
While we sleep, lonelier
For lack of the traveller
Who is now a dream only. 
                
From dawn's twilight
And all the clouds like sheep
On the mountains of sleep
They wind into the night.
?
The next turn may reveal
Heaven: upon the crest
The close pine clump, at rest
Ancl black, may Hell conceal.
?
Often footsore, never
Yet of the road I weary,                  
Though long and steep and dreary,
As it winds on for ever.
?
Helen of the roads,
The mountain ways of Wales
And the Mabinogion tales,
Is one of the true gods,
?
Abiding in the trees,
The threes and fours so wise,
The larger companies,
That by the roadside be,
?
And beneath the rafter
Else uninhabited
Excepting by the dead;
And it is her laughter
?
At morn and night I hear
When the thrush cock sings
Bright irrelevant things,
And when the chanticleer
?
Calls back to their own night
Troops that make loneliness
With their light footsteps' press,
As Helen's own are light.
?
Now all roads lead to France
And heavy is the tread
Of the living; but the dead
Returning lightly dance:
?
Whatever the road bring
To me or take from me,
They keep me company
With their pattering,
?
Crowding the solitude
Of the loops over the downs,
Hushing the roar of towns
 and their brief multitude.

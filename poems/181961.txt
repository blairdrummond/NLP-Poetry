title : The Role of Elegy

author : Mary Jo Bang

text : 
The role of elegy is 
To put a death mask on tragedy, 
A drape on the mirror. 
To bow to the cultural 

Debate over the aesthetization of sorrow, 
Of loss, of the unbearable 
Afterimage of the once material. 
To look for an imagined 

Consolidation of grief 
So we can all be finished 
Once and for all and genuinely shut up 
The cabinet of genuine particulars. 

Instead there’s the endless refrain 
One hears replayed repeatedly 
Through the just ajar door: 
Some terrible mistake has been made. 

What is elegy but the attempt 
To rebreathe life 
Into what the gone one once was 
Before he grew to enormity. 

Come on stage and be yourself, 
The elegist says to the dead. Show them 
Now—after the fact— 
What you were meant to be: 

The performer of a live song. 
A shoe. Now bow. 
What is left but this: 
The compulsion to tell. 

The transient distraction of ink on cloth 
One scrubbed and scrubbed 
But couldn’t make less. 
Not them, not soon. 

Each day, a new caption on the cartoon 
Ending that simply cannot be. 
One hears repeatedly, the role of elegy is.

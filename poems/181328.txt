title : Barley Field

author : Olav H. Hauge

text : 
An old woodcut of the London Bridge   
and a colored lithograph of a barley field.   
There are no other pictures on Ward D. 

The London Bridge lifts sooty towers above the river.   
But it's the barley field I see.   
A golden ocean of barley. 

It's not like the other grain-fields.   
Maybe it's those inward-looking eyes   
gone into it so it becomes heaven? 

A fall-colored sky, mild,   
with no harvesters and no scythes.

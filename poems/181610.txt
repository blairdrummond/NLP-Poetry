text : 
We've packed our bags, we're set to fly 
no one knows where, the maps won't do. 
We're crossing the ocean's nihilistic blue 
with an unborn infant's opal eye. 

It has the clarity of earth and sky 
seen from a spacecraft, once removed, 
as through an amniotic lens, that groove- 
lessness of space, the last star by. 

We have set out to live and die 
into the interstices of a new 
nowhere to be or be returning to 

(a little like an infant's airborne cry). 
We've set our sights on nothing left to lose 
and made of loss itself a lullaby.

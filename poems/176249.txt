Jair son of Manasseh went and seized the encampments And called them the Encampments of Jair Nobah went and seized Kenath With its outlying villages And called it Nobah After himself.  (Numbers 32: 41-42)
1827 

D’Entrecasteaux enters the bay   
Looks it over 
Leaves it with name of his ship:   
“Astrolabe Bay.” 


1871-1883 

Baron Nikolai Miklouho-Maclay 
(Tibud Maclay)   
Comes and goes   
Exploring 
Recording the language 
As a reward for hospitality 
Leaves the coast with 
His own name:   
“Maclay Coast” 

To further honor 
The place where he landed 
He called it “Constantine Harbour” 
(Grand Duke Constantine 
President of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society   
Had paid for the trip.) 


1878 

Australian gold-prospectors   
Put in at Bongu 
In the good ship Dove 
But leave at once 
Forgetting to name the place   
“Dove Harbor” 
But there is a “Dove Point” 
A hundred miles up the coast. 


1884 

Herr Finsch 
Representing the Neu Guinea Kompagnie 
Hoists the German flag   
Over “Bismarck (naturally)   
Archipelago” “Kaiser 
(Of course) Wilhelmsland” 
And last but not least 
“Finschhafen.”

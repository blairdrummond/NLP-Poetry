In the shape of a submarine 
frost lengthens on a window. 
Outside, winter sparrows perch 
in rhinoceros-colored trees. 
Mare's tails chase whitely 
past brick chimneys. 
I have seen those lights before, 
small rectangular eyes 
of far buildings, one church 
steeple darkening the blue sky. 




      * 
It looks like a stopped grey heart, 
if hearts sport such delicate scallops 
and trees wear hearts on their sleeves. 
Now the first wasp of spring emerges, 
its wings a transparency of fish scales, 
old isinglass or vein-fretted windows— 
wings of the first untranscendent angel 
sentenced to death by the god frost. 
How can some later spring reclaim this 
paper city or repair its walls damaged 
in the long drop from the one hundred 
and twentieth odd year of a tree? 




      * 
The sky wears that color through which 
you expect a tornado's black drill. 
Only cicadas try the air, a scratching 
that cannon could not silence. 
Beyond the barn with three siloes 
and the wind pump stopped like a tin daisy, 
carp lip the surface of reflected sky, 
the promised violence. 




      * 
I always imagined that place 
as an orchard on a mountaintop, 
its summer Delicious freckling 
to a sunset by Seurat. 
But the last time it was fall, 
the sere grass bent one way 
toward an open gate, 
as though a great wind had swept 
down stones of the garden walls. 
Two posts bent where the orchard 
had been, their purpose obscure. 
They stood, I think, where flowers 
had rivaled deepest 
in their colors and scents.

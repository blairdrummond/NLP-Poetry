title : Looking Out the Window Poem

author : Denis Johnson

text : 
The sounds of traffic   
die over the back lawn   
to occur again in the low   
distance. 

The voices, risen, of 
the neighborhood cannot   
maintain that pitch   
and fail briefly, start   
up again. 

Similarly my breathing rises   
and falls while I look out   
the window of apartment   
number three in this slum,   
hoping for rage, or sorrow. 

They don’t come to me   
anymore. How can I lament   
anything? It is all 
so proper, so much 
as it should be, now 

the nearing cumulus   
clouds, ominous,   
shift, they are like the 
curtains, billowy,   
veering at the apex 
of their intrusion on the room. 
If I am alive now,   
it is only 

to be in all this 
making all possible.   
I am glad to be 
finally a part 
of such machinery. I was   
after all not so fond 
of living, and there comes 
into me, when I see   
how little I liked 
being a man, a great joy. 

Look out our astounding 
clear windows before evening.   
It is almost as if 
the world were blue 
with some lubricant, 
it shines so.

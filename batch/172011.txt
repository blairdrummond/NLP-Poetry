title : from Cabbage Gardens

text : 
The past 
will overtake   
alien force   
our house   
formed 
of my mind   
to enter 
explorer 
in a forest   
of myself 
for all 
my learning   
Solitude 
quiet 
and quieter   
fringe 
of trees 
by a river 
bridges black   
on the deep   
the heaving sea   
a watcher stands 
to see her ship   
winging away   
Thick noises 
merge in moonlight   
dark ripples   
dissolving 
and 
defining 
spheres 
and 
snares 

             Place of importance as in the old days 
stood on the ramparts of the fort 
                                                 the open sea outside   
alone with water-birds and cattle 
                        knee-deep in a stream 
grove of reeds 
               herons watching from the bank 
henges 
      whole fields honeycombed with souterrains   
human 
                        bones through the gloom 
       whose sudden mouth 
surrounded my face 
                      a thread of blue around the coast   
                                                         feathery moon   
eternity swallows up time 
                                     peaceable as foam 
                        O cabbage gardens 
summer’s elegy 
                        sunset survived

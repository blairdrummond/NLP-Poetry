title : Consolation

author : Matthew Arnold

text : 
Mist clogs the sunshine. 
Smoky dwarf houses 
Hem me round everywhere; 
A vague dejection 
Weighs down my soul. 

Yet, while I languish, 
Everywhere countless 
Prospects unroll themselves, 
And countless beings 
Pass countless moods. 

Far hence, in Asia, 
On the smooth convent-roofs, 
On the gilt terraces, 
Of holy Lassa, 
Bright shines the sun. 

Grey time-worn marbles 
Hold the pure Muses; 
In their cool gallery, 
By yellow Tiber, 
They still look fair. 

Strange unloved uproar 
Shrills round their portal; 
Yet not on Helicon 
Kept they more cloudless 
Their noble calm. 

Through sun-proof alleys 
In a lone, sand-hemm'd 
City of Africa, 
A blind, led beggar, 
Age-bow'd, asks alms. 

No bolder robber 
Erst abode ambush'd 
Deep in the sandy waste; 
No clearer eyesight 
Spied prey afar. 

Saharan sand-winds 
Sear'd his keen eyeballs; 
Spent is the spoil he won. 
For him the present 
Holds only pain. 

Two young, fair lovers, 
Where the warm June-wind, 
Fresh from the summer fields 
Plays fondly round them, 
Stand, tranced in joy. 

With sweet, join'd voices, 
And with eyes brimming: 
"Ah," they cry, "Destiny, 
Prolong the present! 
Time, stand still here!" 

The prompt stern Goddess 
Shakes her head, frowning; 
Time gives his hour-glass 
Its due reversal; 
Their hour is gone. 

With weak indulgence 
Did the just Goddess 
Lengthen their happiness, 
She lengthen'd also 
Distress elsewhere. 

The hour, whose happy 
Unalloy'd moments 
I would eternalise, 
Ten thousand mourners 
Well pleased see end. 

The bleak, stern hour, 
Whose severe moments 
I would annihilate, 
Is pass'd by others 
In warmth, light, joy. 

Time, so complain'd of, 
Who to no one man 
Shows partiality, 
Brings round to all men 
Some undimm'd hours.

title : For No Clear Reason

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
I dreamt last night 
the fright was over, that 
the dust came, and then water,   
and women and men, together   
again, and all was quiet 
in the dim moon’s light. 

A paean of such patience— 
laughing, laughing at me,   
and the days extend over 
the earth’s great cover, 
grass, trees, and flower- 
ing season, for no clear reason.

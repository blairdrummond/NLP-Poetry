title : Year’s End

author : Richard Wilbur

text : 
Now winter downs the dying of the year,   
And night is all a settlement of snow; 
From the soft street the rooms of houses show   
A gathered light, a shapen atmosphere,   
Like frozen-over lakes whose ice is thin   
And still allows some stirring down within. 

I’ve known the wind by water banks to shake 
The late leaves down, which frozen where they fell   
And held in ice as dancers in a spell   
Fluttered all winter long into a lake;   
Graved on the dark in gestures of descent,   
They seemed their own most perfect monument. 

There was perfection in the death of ferns   
Which laid their fragile cheeks against the stone   
A million years. Great mammoths overthrown   
Composedly have made their long sojourns,   
Like palaces of patience, in the gray 
And changeless lands of ice. And at Pompeii 

The little dog lay curled and did not rise   
But slept the deeper as the ashes rose 
And found the people incomplete, and froze   
The random hands, the loose unready eyes   
Of men expecting yet another sun 
To do the shapely thing they had not done. 

These sudden ends of time must give us pause.   
We fray into the future, rarely wrought 
Save in the tapestries of afterthought. 
More time, more time. Barrages of applause   
Come muffled from a buried radio. 
The New-year bells are wrangling with the snow.

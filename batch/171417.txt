title : In the Kingdom of Pleasure

author : Alan R. Shapiro

text : 
Unwitting accomplice in the scheme of law   
she thought to violate, man-set as it was,   
and, here, inconsequential as the sun   
at midnight, drought at flood-time— 
when she heard a baby in the tall reeds   
at the river’s brink, she was nobody’s   
daughter, subject of no rule 
but the one his need for her established   
as she knelt down to quell his crying   
with a little tune just seeing him there   
had taught her how to hum. 

                                        Now as then, 
it is the same tune, timelessly in time,   
your mother hums as she kneels down   
beside your little barge of foam, 
smiling to see you smile when she wrings 
out from the sponge a ragged string   
of water over the chest and belly,   
the dimpled loins, the bud so far   
from flowering, and the foot slick 
as a fish your hand tries to hold up 
till it slips back splashing 
with such mild turbulence that she laughs,   
and you laugh to see her laugh. 

Here now, as it was then, it is still 
so many years before the blood’s smeared   
over doorposts, before the Nile clots   
with the first-born, and the women   
wailing,wailing throughout the city; 
here now again is the kingdom of pleasure,   
where they are safe still, mother and child,   
from the chartered rod of the Fathers,   
and where a father can still pray, Lord,   
Jealous Chooser, Devouring Law, keep   
away from them, just keep away.

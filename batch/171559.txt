Debridement Black men are oaks cut down.  Congressional Medal of Honor Society  United States of America chartered by  Congress, August 14, 1958; this certifies  that STAC John Henry Louis is a member  of this society.  “Don’t ask me anything about the  medal. I don’t even know how I won  it.”  Debridement: The cutting away of dead  or contaminated tissue from a wound  to prevent infection.  America: love it or give it back.
Corktown 
Groceries ring 
in my intestines: 
grits aint groceries   
eggs aint poultry 
Mona Lisa was a man:   
waltzing in sawdust   
I dream my cards 
has five holes in it,   
up to twenty holes;   
five shots out of seven   
beneath the counter;   
surrounded by detectives   
pale ribbons of valor   
my necklace of bullets   
powdering the operating table. 

Five impaled men loop their ribbons   
’round my neck 
listening to whispers of valor: 
“Honey, what you cryin’ ’bout?   
You made it back.” 


Caves 
Four M-48 tank platoons ambushed 
near Dak To, two destroyed:   
the Ho Chi Minh Trail boils,   
half my platoon rockets   
into stars near Cambodia, 
foot soldiers dance from highland woods 
taxing our burning half: 

there were no caves for them to hide. 
 
We saw no action, 
eleven months twenty-two days   
in our old tank 
burning sixty feet away: 
I watch them burn inside out:   
hoisting through heavy crossfire,   
hoisting over turret hatches,   
hoisting my last burning man   
alive to the ground, 
our tank artillery shells explode   
killing all inside: 
hoisting blown burned squad   
in tank’s bladder, 
plug leaks with cave blood: 

there were no caves for them to hide— 


In the Projects 
Slung basketballs at Jeffries   
House with some welfare kids   
weaving in their figure eight hunger. 

Mama asked if I was taking anything?   
I rolled up my sleeves: 
no tracks, mama: 
“black-medal-man ain’t street-poisoned,” 
militants called: 
“he’s an electronic nigger!” 

“Better keep electronic nigger 'way.” 
Electronic Nigger?   
Mama, unplug me, please. 


A White Friend Flies In from the Coast 
Burned—black by birth, 
burned—armed with .45, 
burned—submachine gun, 
burned—STAC hunted VC, 
burned—killing 5-20, 
burned—nobody know for sure;   
burned—out of ammo, 
burned—killed one with gun-stock,   
burned—VC AK-47 jammed,   
burned—killed faceless VC,   
burned—over and over, 
burned—STAC subdued by three men,   
burned—three shots: morphine,   
burned—tried killing prisoners,   
burned—taken to Pleiku, 
burned—held down, straitjacket, 
burned—whites owe him, hear?   
burned—I owe him, here. 


Mama’s Report 
“Don’t fight, honey,   
don’t let ’em catch you.” 

Tour over, gear packed,   
hospital over, no job. 

“Aw man, nothin' happened,” 
explorer, altar boy— 

Maybe it’s ’cause they killed people   
and don’t know why they did? 

My boy had color slides of dead people,   
stacks of dead Vietnamese. 

MP’s asked if he’d been arrested   
since discharge, what he’d been doin’: 

“Lookin’ at slides, 
looking’ at stacks of slides, mostly.” 

Fifteen minutes later a colonel called 
from the Defense Department, said he’d won the medal; 

could he be in Washington with his family,   
maybe he’d get a job now; he qualified. 

The Democrats had lost, the president said;   
there were signs of movement in Paris: 


Fixing Certificates:   Dog Tags:   Letters Home 
Our heliteam had mid-air blowout   
dropping flares—5 burned alive. 

The children carry hand   
grenades to and from piss tubes. 

Staring at tracer bullets 
rice is the focal point of war. 

On amphibious raid, our heliteam 
found dead VC with maps of our compound. 

On morning sick call you unzip;   
before you piss you get a smear. 

“VC reamed that mustang a new asshole”— 
even at movies: “no round-eye pussy no more”— 

Tympanic membrane damage: high gone— 
20-40 db loss mid-frequencies. 

Scrub-typhus, malaria, dengue fever, cholera;   
rotting buffalo, maggoted dog, decapped children. 

Bangkok: amber dust, watches, C-rations,   
elephanthide billfolds, cameras, smack. 

Sand&tinroof bunkers, 81/120 mm: 
“Health record terminated this date by reason of death.” 

Vaculoated amoeba, bacillary dysentery, hookworm; 
thorazine, tetracycline, darvon for diarrhea. 

'Conitus’: I wanna go home to mama; 
Brown’s mixture, ETH with codeine, cortisone skin-creams. 

Written on helipad fantail 600 bed Repose; 
“no purple heart, hit by ’nother marine.” 

“Vascular repair, dissection, debridement”: 
sharp bone edges, mushy muscle, shrapnel: stainless bucket. 

Bodies in polyethylene bag: transport:   
'Tan San Nhat Mortuary’ 

Blood, endotracheal tube, prep   
abdomen, mid-chest to scrotum— 

“While you’re fixin' me doc, 
can you fix them ingrown hairs on my face?” 

“They didn’t get my balls, did they?” 
50 mg thorazine—“Yes they did, marine!” 


Street-Poisoned 
Swans loom on the playground   
swooning in the basket air, 
the nod of their bills 
in open flight, open formation.   
Street-poisoned, a gray mallard   
skims into our courtyard with a bag: 

And he poisons them— 
And he poisons them— 
 
Electronic-nigger-recruiter, 
my pass is a blade   
near the sternum 
cutting in: 
you can make this a career. 

Patches itch on my chest and shoulders— 
I powder them with phisohex 
solution from an aerosol can: 
you can make this a career. 

Pickets of insulin dab the cloudy 
hallways in a spray. 
Circuits of change 
march to an honor guard— 
I am prancing:   
I am prancing: 

you can make this a career. 


Makin’ Jump Shots 
He waltzes into the lane 
’cross the free-throw line,   
fakes a drive, pivots, 
floats from the asphalt turf   
in an arc of black light, 
and sinks two into the chains. 

One on one he fakes   
down the main, passes   
into the free lane 
and hits the chains. 

A sniff in the fallen air— 
he stuffs it through the chains   
riding high: 
“traveling” someone calls— 
and he laughs, stepping 
to a silent beat, gliding 
as he sinks two into the chains.

The Family of Debridement 
Theory: Inconvenienced subject will return to hospital   
if loaned Thunderbird 
Withdrawn. Hope: Subject returns, 
Treatment: 
Foreclosure for nine months unpaid mortgage;   
wife tells subject hospital wants deposit, 
Diseased cyst removal: 
'Ain’t you gonna give me a little kiss good-bye’ 
Subject-wife: To return with robe and curlers— 
Subject tells friend he’ll pay $15 to F’s stepfather   
if he’ll drive him to pick up money owed him. 

“This guy lives down the street, 
I don’t want him to see me coming.” 

“It looked odd for a car filled with blacks 
to be parked in the dark in a white neighborhood,   
so we pulled the car out under a streetlight   
so everybody could see us.” 

Store manager: “I first hit him with two bullets   
so I pulled the trigger until my gun was empty.” 

“I’m going to kill you, you white MF,” store manager   
told police. Police took cardload, F and F’s parents for   
further questioning. Subject died on operating table: 5 hrs: 

Subject buried on grass slope, 200 yards   
east of Kennedy Memorial, 
overlooking Potomac and Pentagon,   
to the south, 
Arlington National Cemetery.

text : 
There are days I don’t think about the sea;
              weeks wash by in fact,
 then a shearwater—or some such—flutters by
 on the salt flats fanning out in my mind’s eye,
 reflected there, a shimmering reverie,
                             recalling the pact
  
 I once made (and renew today) to hold
              to a higher altitude.
 But note the difference between this bird
 and me: a slight disruption or harsh word
 and I crash, folded seaward, letting cold 
                             life intrude;
  
 whereas the petrel, mindless of such height,
              scales each watery hill
 that rises up, adapting to the shape
 of each impediment, each low escape
 instinct in it, the scope of its flight
                             fitted to its will.

title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 116

author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson

text : 
Is it, then, regret for buried time 
         That keenlier in sweet April wakes, 
         And meets the year, and gives and takes 
The colours of the crescent prime? 

Not all: the songs, the stirring air, 
         The life re-orient out of dust, 
         Cry thro' the sense to hearten trust 
In that which made the world so fair. 

Not all regret: the face will shine 
         Upon me, while I muse alone; 
         And that dear voice, I once have known, 
Still speak to me of me and mine: 

Yet less of sorrow lives in me 
         For days of happy commune dead; 
         Less yearning for the friendship fled, 
Than some strong bond which is to be.

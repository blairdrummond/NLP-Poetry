title : The Two Streams

author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

text : 
   Behold the rocky wall
   That down its sloping sides
Pours the swift rain-drops, blending, as they fall,
   In rushing river-tides!

   Yon stream, whose sources run
   Turned by a pebble’s edge,
Is Athabasca, rolling toward the sun
   Through the cleft mountain-ledge.

   The slender rill had strayed,
   But for the slanting stone,
To evening’s ocean, with the tangled braid
   Of foam-flecked Oregon.

   So from the heights of Will
   Life’s parting stream descends,
And, as a moment turns its slender rill,
   Each widening torrent bends,—

   From the same cradle’s side,
   From the same mother’s knee,—
One to long darkness and the frozen tide,
   One to the Peaceful Sea!

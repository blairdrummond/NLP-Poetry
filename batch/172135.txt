title : The Youngest Daughter

text : 
The sky has been dark 
for many years. 
My skin has become as damp 
and pale as rice paper 
and feels the way 
mother’s used to before the drying sun   
parched it out there in the fields. 

      Lately, when I touch my eyelids, 
my hands react as if 
I had just touched something 
hot enough to burn. 
My skin, aspirin colored,   
tingles with migraine. Mother 
has been massaging the left side of my face   
especially in the evenings   
when the pain flares up. 

This morning 
her breathing was graveled, 
her voice gruff with affection   
when I wheeled her into the bath.   
She was in a good humor, 
making jokes about her great breasts,   
floating in the milky water 
like two walruses, 
flaccid and whiskered around the nipples.   
I scrubbed them with a sour taste   
in my mouth, thinking: 
six children and an old man 
have sucked from these brown nipples. 

I was almost tender 
when I came to the blue bruises 
that freckle her body, 
places where she has been injecting insulin   
for thirty years. I soaped her slowly, 
she sighed deeply, her eyes closed. 
It seems it has always 
been like this: the two of us 
in this sunless room, 
the splashing of the bathwater. 

In the afternoons 
when she has rested, 
she prepares our ritual of tea and rice,   
garnished with a shred of gingered fish, 
a slice of pickled turnip, 
a token for my white body.   
We eat in the familiar silence. 
She knows I am not to be trusted,   
even now planning my escape.   
As I toast to her health 
with the tea she has poured, 
a thousand cranes curtain the window, 
fly up in a sudden breeze.

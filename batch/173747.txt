title : On Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again

author : John Keats

text : 
O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute! 
   Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away! 
   Leave melodizing on this wintry day, 
Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute: 
Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute, 
   Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay 
   Must I burn through; once more humbly assay 
The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit. 
Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion, 
   Begetters of our deep eternal theme, 
When through the old oak forest I am gone, 
   Let me not wander in a barren dream, 
But when I am consumed in the fire, 
Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.

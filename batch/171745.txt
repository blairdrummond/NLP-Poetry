text : 
And here face down beneath the sun   
And here upon earth’s noonward height   
To feel the always coming on 
The always rising of the night: 

To feel creep up the curving east   
The earthy chill of dusk and slow   
Upon those under lands the vast   
And ever climbing shadow grow 

And strange at Ecbatan the trees   
Take leaf by leaf the evening strange   
The flooding dark about their knees   
The mountains over Persia change 

And now at Kermanshah the gate   
Dark empty and the withered grass   
And through the twilight now the late   
Few travelers in the westward pass 

And Baghdad darken and the bridge   
Across the silent river gone 
And through Arabia the edge 
Of evening widen and steal on 

And deepen on Palmyra’s street 
The wheel rut in the ruined stone   
And Lebanon fade out and Crete 
High through the clouds and overblown 

And over Sicily the air 
Still flashing with the landward gulls   
And loom and slowly disappear   
The sails above the shadowy hulls 

And Spain go under and the shore   
Of Africa the gilded sand 
And evening vanish and no more   
The low pale light across that land 

Nor now the long light on the sea: 

And here face downward in the sun   
To feel how swift how secretly 
The shadow of the night comes on ...

(Instructions for the Visit)
Admire, when you come here, the glimmering hair   
Of the girl; praise her pale 
Complexion. Think well of her dress   
Though that is somewhat out of fashion.   
Don’t try to take her hand, but smile for   
Her hesitant gentleness. 
Say the old woman is looking strong   
Today; such hardiness. Remark, 
Perhaps, how she has dressed herself black   
Like a priest, and wears that sufficient air   
That does become the righteous. 
As you approach, she will push back   
Her chair, shove away her plate 
And wait, 
Sitting squat and direct, before 
The red mahogany chest 
Massive as some great 
Safe; will wait, 
By the table and her greasy plate, 
The bone half-chewed, her wine half-drained;   
She will wait. And fix her steady 
Eyes on you—the straight stare 
Of an old politician. 
Try once to meet her eyes. But fail.   
Let your sight 
Drift—yet never as if hunting for 
The keys (you keep imagining) hung   
By her belt. (They are not there.) 
Watch, perhaps, that massive chest—the way   
It tries to lean 
Forward, toward her, till it seems to rest   
Its whole household’s weight 
Of linens and clothing and provisions   
All on her stiff back. 
It might be strapped there like the monstrous pack   
Of some enchanted pedlar. Dense, self-contained,   
Like mercury in a ball, 
She can support this without strain,   
Yet she grows smaller, wrinkling   
Like a potato, parched as dung;   
It cramps her like a fist. 
Ask no one why the chest 
Has no knobs. Betray 
No least suspicion 
The necessities within 
Could vanish at her 
Will. Try not to think 
That as she feeds, gains 
Specific gravity, 
She shrinks, light- 
less as the world’s 
Hard core 
And the per- 
spective drains 
In her. 
Finally, above all, 
You must not ever see, 
Or let slip one hint you can see,   
On the other side, the girl’s 
Cuffs, like cordovan restraints; 
Forget her bony, tentative wrist, 
The half-fed, worrying eyes, and how   
She backs out, bows, and tries to bow   
Out of the scene, grows too ethereal   
To make a shape inside her dress 
And the dress itself is beginning already   
To sublime itself away like a vapor   
That merges into the empty twinkling   
Of the air and of the bright wallpaper.

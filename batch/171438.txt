title : In the Marble Quarry

author : James L. Dickey

text : 
Beginning to dangle beneath 
The wind that blows from the undermined wood,   
      I feel the great pulley grind, 

      The thread I cling to lengthen   
And let me soaring and spinning down into marble, 
      Hooked and weightlessly happy 

      Where the squared sun shines 
Back equally from all four sides, out of stone   
      And years of dazzling labor, 

      To land at last among men 
Who cut with power saws a Parian whiteness 
      And, chewing slow tobacco, 

      Their eyebrows like frost, 
Shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables   
      And send them heavenward 

      Into small-town banks, 
Into the columns and statues of government buildings,   
      But mostly graves. 

      I mount my monument and rise 
Slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men   
      Toward the hewn sky 

      Out of the basement of light, 
Sadly, lifted through time’s blinding layers   
      On perhaps my tombstone 

      In which the original shape 
Michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth   
      Is heavily stirring, 

      Surprised to be an angel, 
To be waked in North Georgia by the ponderous play   
      Of men with ten-ton blocks 

      But no more surprised than I 
To feel sadness fall off as though I myself   
      Were rising from stone 

      Held by a thread in midair, 
Badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired,   
      Not a masterwork 

      Or even worth seeing at all 
But the spirit of this place just the same,   
      Felt here as joy.

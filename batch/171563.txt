title : The Pool

author : Robert Creeley

text : 
My embarrassment at his nakedness,   
at the pool’s edge, 
and my wife, with his, 
standing, watching— 

this was a freedom   
not given me who am   
more naked, 
less contained 

by my own white flesh 
and the ability   
to take quietly   
what comes to me. 

The sense of myself   
separate, grew 
a white mirror 
in the quiet water 

he breaks with his hands   
and feet, kicking, 
pulls up to land 
on the edge by the feet 

of these women   
who must know   
that for each 
man is a speech 

describes him, makes 
the day grow white 
and sure, a quietness of water   
in the mind, 

lets hang, descriptive   
as a risk, something 
for which he cannot find   
a means or time.

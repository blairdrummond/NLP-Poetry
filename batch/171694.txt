A small wheel   
Incandescent,   
Shivering like 
A pinned butterfly. 

Hands thrown up   
In all directions:   
The crossroads   
One arrives at 
In a nightmare. 

Higher than that 
Number 12 presides 
Like a beekeeper 
Over the swarming honeycomb   
Of the open watch. 

Other wheels   
That could fit   
Inside a raindrop. 

Tools 
That must be splinters   
Of arctic starlight. 

Tiny golden mills   
Grinding invisible   
Coffee beans. 

When the coffee’s boiling   
Cautiously, 
So it doesn’t burn us, 
We raise it 
To the lips 
Of the nearest 
Ear.

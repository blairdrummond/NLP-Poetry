title : Nude Descending

author : Alicia Ostriker

text : 
Like a bowerbird trailing a beakful of weeds   
Like prize ribbons for the very best 

The lover, producer   
Of another’s pleasure 

He whom her swollen lips await 
Might wing through any day of the decade 

A form of health insurance   
For which it is never too late 

Titanic, silver brush 
Hindenburg, of exploding cigars a climax 

The watery below, the fiery above 
Ashes of print between—pigment between 


If the crippled woman were to descend   
From her bed, her fortress beyond midnight 

Downstairs (nude/staircase) to the kitchen   
Naked to sit at the table (writing/thinking) 

She might hear the washer spin like a full orchestra   
Complete a cycle like a train crash 

Before the fiend would stare through the window   
Step smoothly into the kitchen, stop some clocks. 

Envy shapes a fig tree in one’s breast,   
That is, bluntly to say, a cancer, 

That is to say 
In a mind, a fertile windy field. A murdered child. 

Well then, fear, primarily of falling.   
Ebony surf toils on the beach, a glaze 

At the same moment I am (from a cliff) falling   
The kitchen fiend removes his Dior tie 

Places his hand over the woman’s   
And softly says: I am the lover. 


Now if the crippled woman began to dance   
To pirouette, to rumba 

Growling for her child 
Her burning page, the devil would be shamed 

(Materialism is not for everyone / Religion is   
The extension of politics by other means) 

Would disembody like a wicked smoke   
Back to the status of myth 

Away he’d streak, blue, into the— 
O faun, we would finally call, farewell 

O faun, we would faintly faintly call   
O faun, we would, we would fondly— 

She does not dance. She does not wish   
To produce another’s pleasure. 

They have torn her apart   
Into beige rectangles.

title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 124

author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson

text : 
That which we dare invoke to bless; 
         Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt; 
         He, They, One, All; within, without; 
The Power in darkness whom we guess; 

I found Him not in world or sun, 
         Or eagle's wing, or insect's eye; 
         Nor thro' the questions men may try, 
The petty cobwebs we have spun: 

If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep, 
         I heard a voice, "Believe no more," 
         And heard an ever-breaking shore 
That tumbled in the Godless deep, 

A warmth within the breast would melt 
         The freezing reason's colder part, 
         And like a man in wrath the heart 
Stood up and answer'd, "I have felt." 

No, like a child in doubt and fear: 
         But that blind clamour made me wise; 
         Then was I as a child that cries, 
But crying, knows his father near; 

And what I am beheld again 
         What is, and no man understands; 
         And out of darkness came the hands 
That reach thro' nature, moulding men.

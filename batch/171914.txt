Pushing off on her back out   
Into the fishpond’s cold 
Archaic glitter, my naked wife   
Could not have guessed how 

High she rode into the noon   
Sky, a brightened polestar   
Gliding out between nothing   
And nothing, between a sun- 

Lit vacancy and its ancient,   
Reflected, weightless 
Hour unrippling back 
From the sedges. The just- 

Cut grasses fumed around her   
Like gasoline, a few 
Spent bees dozed above 
The compost, and in my arms 

The steady thrum of the mower   
Carried on, though I’d 
Shut it off to sit down 
And watch: but so fond of her, 

The water parted to take   
Her back from that aimless   
Sky, where light- 
Headed and slippery as a star 

She turtled under the still   
Simmering Indian summer   
To startle the sunfish 
At the margins—then punctured 

Back with a blow-frog’s gasp,   
An amazed stranger 
Conjured into the world 
By a willow shadow 

Spread out on the grass   
Like an extravagant Old   
World gesture no 
One believes in anymore. 

On that stalled shore she climbed   
Back out among the cool 
And slightly washed- 
Out leaves to towel off, 

Put on her clothes, and shake   
Her hair out in no time 
Which slips off into the past,   
Or future, into nothing 

But the pure unburnished hum- 
Drum of that moment, that place,   
From which we turned away   
Eventually and went back to work.

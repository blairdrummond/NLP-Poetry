title : Two Pigeons

author : Mary Jo Salter

text : 
They’ve perched for hours 
on that window-ledge, scarcely   
moving. Beak to beak, 

a matched set, they differ   
almost imperceptibly— 
like salt and pepper shakers. 

It’s an event when they tuck   
(simultaneously) their pinpoint   
heads into lavender vests 

of fat. But reminiscent   
of clock hands blandly   
turning because they must 

have turned—somehow, they’ve   
taken on the grave,   
small-eyed aspect of monks 

hooded in conferences 
so intimate nothing need 
be said. If some are chuckling 

in the park, earning 
their bread, these are content   
to let the dark engulf them— 

it’s all the human   
imagination can fathom,   
how single-mindedly 

mindless two silhouettes   
stand in a window thick   
as milk glass. They appear 

never to have fed on   
anything else when they stir   
all of a sudden to peck 

savagely, for love 
or hygiene, at the grimy   
feathers of the other; 

but when they resume   
their places, the shift   
is one only a painter 

or a barber (prodding a chin   
back into position)   
would be likely to notice.

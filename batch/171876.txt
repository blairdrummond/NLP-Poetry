title : Native Trees

author : W. S. Merwin

text : 
Neither my father nor my mother knew   
the names of the trees   
where I was born 
what is that 
I asked and my 
father and mother did not 
hear they did not look where I pointed   
surfaces of furniture held   
the attention of their fingers   
and across the room they could watch 
walls they had forgotten   
where there were no questions   
no voices and no shade 

Were there trees 
where they were children   
where I had not been   
I asked 
were there trees in those places 
where my father and my mother were born   
and in that time did 
my father and my mother see them 
and when they said yes it meant 
they did not remember 
What were they I asked what were they   
but both my father and my mother 
said they never knew

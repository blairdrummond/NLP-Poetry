text : 
Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske, 
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds, 
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske, 
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds, 
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds; 
Whose prayses having slept in silence long, 
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds 
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng: 
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song. 
Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine, 
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will, 
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne 
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still, 
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill, 
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long 
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill, 
That I must rue his undeserved wrong: 
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong. 
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove, 
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart 
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove, 
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart, 
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart, 
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde: 
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart, 
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd, 
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd. 
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright, 
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine, 
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light 
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine, 
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne, 
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile, 
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine, 
The argument of mine afflicted stile: 
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while. 

i 
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine, 
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, 
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, 
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; 
Yet armes till that time did he never wield: 
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt, 
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield: 
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, 
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. 

ii 
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore, 
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord, 
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, 
And dead as living ever him ador'd: 
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd, 
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had: 
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word, 
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad; 
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. 

iii 
Upon a great adventure he was bond, 
That greatest Gloriana to him gave, 
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond, 
To winne him worship, and her grace to have, 
Which of all earthly things he most did crave; 
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne 
To prove his puissance in battell brave 
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne; 
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne. 

iv 
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside, 
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow, 
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide 
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low, 
And over all a blacke stole she did throw, 
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad, 
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow; 
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had, 
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad. 

v 
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe, 
She was in life and every vertuous lore, 
And by descent from Royall lynage came 
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore 
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore, 
And all the world in their subjection held; 
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore 
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld: 
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld. 

vi 
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag, 
That lasie seemd in being ever last, 
Or wearied with bearing of her bag 
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past, 
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, 
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine 
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast, 
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain, 
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain. 

vii 
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, 
A shadie grove not far away they spide, 
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand: 
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, 
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, 
Not perceable with power of any starre: 
And all within were pathes and alleies wide, 
With footing worne, and leading inward farre: 
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre. 

viii 
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, 
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, 
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, 
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. 
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, 
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall, 
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry, 
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all, 
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall. 

ix 
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours 
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still, 
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours, 
The Eugh obedient to the benders will, 
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill, 
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, 
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill, 
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round, 
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound. 

x 
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way, 
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne; 
When weening to returne, whence they did stray, 
They cannot find that path, which first was showne, 
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, 
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, 
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: 
So many pathes, so many turnings seene, 
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been. 

xi 
At last resolving forward still to fare, 
Till that some end they finde or in or out, 
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare, 
And like to lead the labyrinth about; 
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout, 
At length it brought them to a hollow cave, 
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout 
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave, 
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave. 

xii 
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde, 
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: 
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde, 
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke, 
And perill without show: therefore your stroke 
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made. 
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke 
The forward footing for an hidden shade: 
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade. 

xiii 
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place 
I better wot then you, though now too late 
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace, 
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate, 
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate. 
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den, 
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate: 
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then 
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men. 

xiv 
But full of fire and greedy hardiment, 
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide, 
But forth unto the darksome hole he went, 
And looked in: his glistring armor made 
A litle glooming light, much like a shade, 
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine, 
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide, 
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine, 
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine. 

xv 
And as she lay upon the durtie ground, 
Her huge long taile her den all overspred, 
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, 
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred 
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed, 
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone 
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored: 
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone, 
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone. 

xvi 
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, 
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile 
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid 
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. 
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle 
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe; 
For light she hated as the deadly bale, 
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine, 
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine. 

xvii 
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept 
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray, 
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept 
From turning backe, and forced her to stay: 
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray, 
And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst, 
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay: 
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: 
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst. 

xviii 
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, 
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round, 
And all attonce her beastly body raizd 
With doubled forces high above the ground: 
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd, 
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine 
All suddenly about his body wound, 
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine: 
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine. 

xix 
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint, 
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee, 
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint: 
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee. 
That when he heard, in great perplexitie, 
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine, 
And knitting all his force got one hand free, 
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, 
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine. 

xx 
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw 
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke, 
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw, 
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke 
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: 
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was, 
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, 
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras: 
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has. 

xxi 
As when old father Nilus gins to swell 
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale, 
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell, 
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale: 
But when his later spring gins to avale, 
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed 
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male 
And partly female of his fruitfull seed; 
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed. 

xxii 
The same so sore annoyed has the knight, 
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke, 
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight. 
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, 
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke 
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small, 
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, 
Which swarming all about his legs did crall, 
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all. 

xxiii 
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide, 
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west, 
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide, 
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best; 
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest, 
All striving to infixe their feeble stings, 
That from their noyance he no where can rest, 
But with his clownish hands their tender wings 
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings. 

xxiv 
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame, 
Then of the certaine perill he stood in, 
Halfe furious unto his foe he came, 
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win, 
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin; 
And strooke at her with more then manly force, 
That from her body full of filthie sin 
He raft her hatefull head without remorse; 
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse. 

xxv 
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare 
They saw so rudely falling to the ground, 
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare, 
Gathred themselves about her body round, 
Weening their wonted entrance to have found 
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood 
They flocked all about her bleeding wound, 
And sucked up their dying mothers blood, 
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good. 

xxvi 
That detestable sight him much amazde, 
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst, 
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, 
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, 
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst, 
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end 
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; 
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend, 
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend. 

xxvii 
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre 
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie, 
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre, 
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye: 
Well worthy be you of that Armorie, 
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day, 
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie, 
Your first adventure: many such I pray, 
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may. 

xxviii 
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe, 
And with the Lady backward sought to wend; 
That path he kept, which beaten was most plame, 
Ne ever would to any by-way bend, 
But still did follow one unto the end, 
The which at last out of the wood them brought. 
So forward on his way (with God to frend) 
He passed forth, and new adventure sought; 
Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought. 

xxix 
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way 
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, 
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, 
And by his belt his booke he hanging had; 
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, 
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent, 
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad, 
And all the way he prayed, as he went, 
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent. 

xxx 
He faire the knight saluted, louting low, 
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was: 
And after asked him, if he did know 
Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas. 
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas, 
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell, 
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas, 
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell? 
With holy father sits not with such things to mell. 

xxxi 
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell, 
And homebred evill ye desire to heare, 
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell, 
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. 
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere, 
And shall you well reward to shew the place, 
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare: 
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace, 
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space. 

xxxii 
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse 
His dwelling is, by which no living wight 
May ever passe, but thorough great distresse. 
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night, 
And well I wote, that of your later fight 
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong, 
But wanting rest will also want of might? 
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long, 
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong. 

xxxiii 
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest, 
And with new day new worke at once begin: 
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best. 
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin, 
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win 
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent; 
Therefore with me ye may take up your In 
For this same night. The knight was well content: 
So with that godly father to his home they went. 

xxxiv 
A little lowly Hermitage it was, 
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side, 
Far from resort of people, that did pas 
In travell to and froe: a little wyde 
There was an holy Chappell edifyde, 
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say 
His holy things each morne and eventyde: 
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play, 
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway. 

xxxv 
Arrived there, the little house they fill, 
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was: 
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will; 
The noblest mind the best contentment has. 
With faire discourse the evening so they pas: 
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store, 
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas; 
He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore 
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before. 

xxxvi 
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast, 
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes, 
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast 
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. 
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: 
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, 
He to his study goes, and there amiddes 
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes, 
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes. 

xxxvii 
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible, 
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame, 
With which and other spelles like terrible, 
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame, 
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame 
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light; 
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name 
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night, 
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight. 

xxxviii 
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred 
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes 
Fluttring about his ever damned hed, 
A-waite whereto their service he applyes, 
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies: 
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, 
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes; 
The one of them he gave a message too, 
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo. 

xxxix 
He making speedy way through spersed ayre, 
And through the world of waters wide and peepe, 
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire. 
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe, 
And low, where dawning day doth never peepe, 
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed 
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe 
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed, 
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred. 

xl 
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast, 
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory, 
The other all with silver overcast; 
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye 
Watching to banish Care their enimy, 
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe. 
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly, 
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe 
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe. 

xli 
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft, 
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe 
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft, 
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne 
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne: 
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, 
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne, 
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes, 
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes. 

xlii 
The messenger approching to him spake, 
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine: 
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake. 
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine, 
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe 
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake. 
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine 
In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake, 
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake. 

xliii 
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake, 
And threatned unto him the dreaded name 
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake, 
And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame 
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came. 
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent, 
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame, 
He bids thee to him send for his intent 
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent. 

xliv 
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way 
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke, 
Delivered it to him, and downe did lay 
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke, 
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke. 
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore, 
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke, 
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore 
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore. 

xlv 
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes, 
Had made a Lady of that other Spright, 
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes 
So lively, and so like in all mens sight, 
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight: 
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt, 
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight: 
Her all in white he clad, and over it 
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit. 

xlvi 
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought, 
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly, 
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought 
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy, 
In sort as he him schooled privily: 
And that new creature borne without her dew, 
Full of the makers guile, with usage sly 
He taught to imitate that Lady trew, 
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew. 

xlvii 
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast, 
And comming where the knight in slomber lay, 
The one upon his hardy head him plast, 
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play, 
That nigh his manly hart did melt away, 
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy: 
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay, 
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy, 
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy. 

xlviii 
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene, 
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring 
Her, whom he waking evermore did weene, 
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring 
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king, 
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound: 
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing, 
Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around, 
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd. 

xlix 
In this great passion of unwonted lust, 
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis, 
He started up, as seeming to mistrust 
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his: 
Lo there before his face his Lady is, 
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke, 
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis, 
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke, 
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took. 

l 
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight, 
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise, 
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight: 
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise, 
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise 
To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth. 
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise, 
Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth, 
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth. 

li 
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love, 
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate, 
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above, 
Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate, 
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate? 
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die. 
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state 
You, whom my hard avenging destinie 
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently. 

lii 
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave 
My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares; 
Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave, 
And then againe begun, My weaker yeares 
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares, 
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde: 
Let me not dye in languor and long teares. 
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd? 
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd? 

liii 
Love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint 
Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night 
In secret anguish and unpittied plaint, 
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight. 
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight 
Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew, 
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight 
He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew, 
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew. 

liv 
Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground; 
For all so deare as life is to my hart, 
I deeme your love, and hold me to you bound; 
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart, 
Where cause is none, but to your rest depart. 
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease 
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art, 
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please, 
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease. 

lv 
Long after lay he musing at her mood, 
Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light, 
For whose defence he was to shed his blood. 
At last dull wearinesse of former fight 
Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright, 
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine, 
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight: 
But when he saw his labour all was vaine, 
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.

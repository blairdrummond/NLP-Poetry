title : On Scratchbury Camp

author : Siegfried Sassoon

text : 
Along the grave green downs, this idle afternoon,   
Shadows of loitering silver clouds, becalmed in blue,   
Bring, like unfoldment of a flower, the best of June. 

Shadows outspread in spacious movement, always you   
Have dappled the downs and valleys at this time of year,   
While larks, ascending shrill, praised freedom as they flew.   
Now, through that song, a fighter-squadron’s drone I hear   
From Scratchbury Camp, whose turfed and cowslip’d rampart seems 
More hill than history, ageless and oblivion-blurred. 

I walk the fosse, once manned by bronze and flint-head spear;   
On war’s imperious wing the shafted sun-ray gleams:   
One with the warm sweet air of summer stoops the bird. 

Cloud shadows, drifting slow like heedless daylight dreams,   
Dwell and dissolve; uncircumstanced they pause and pass.   
I watch them go. My horse, contented, crops the grass.

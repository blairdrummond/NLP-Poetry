title : Satire III

author : John Donne

text : 
Kind pity chokes my spleen; brave scorn forbids 
Those tears to issue which swell my eyelids; 
I must not laugh, nor weep sins and be wise; 
Can railing, then, cure these worn maladies? 
Is not our mistress, fair Religion, 
As worthy of all our souls' devotion 
As virtue was in the first blinded age? 
Are not heaven's joys as valiant to assuage 
Lusts, as earth's honour was to them? Alas, 
As we do them in means, shall they surpass 
Us in the end? and shall thy father's spirit 
Meet blind philosophers in heaven, whose merit 
Of strict life may be imputed faith, and hear 
Thee, whom he taught so easy ways and near 
To follow, damn'd? Oh, if thou dar'st, fear this; 
This fear great courage and high valour is. 
Dar'st thou aid mutinous Dutch, and dar'st thou lay 
Thee in ships' wooden sepulchres, a prey 
To leaders' rage, to storms, to shot, to dearth? 
Dar'st thou dive seas, and dungeons of the earth? 
Hast thou courageous fire to thaw the ice 
Of frozen North discoveries? and thrice 
Colder than salamanders, like divine 
Children in th' oven, fires of Spain and the Line, 
Whose countries limbecs to our bodies be, 
Canst thou for gain bear? and must every he 
Which cries not, "Goddess," to thy mistress, draw 
Or eat thy poisonous words? Courage of straw! 
O desperate coward, wilt thou seem bold, and 
To thy foes and his, who made thee to stand 
Sentinel in his world's garrison, thus yield, 
And for forbidden wars leave th' appointed field? 
Know thy foes: the foul devil, whom thou 
Strivest to please, for hate, not love, would allow 
Thee fain his whole realm to be quit; and as 
The world's all parts wither away and pass, 
So the world's self, thy other lov'd foe, is 
In her decrepit wane, and thou loving this, 
Dost love a wither'd and worn strumpet; last, 
Flesh (itself's death) and joys which flesh can taste, 
Thou lovest, and thy fair goodly soul, which doth 
Give this flesh power to taste joy, thou dost loathe. 
Seek true religion. O where? Mirreus, 
Thinking her unhous'd here, and fled from us, 
Seeks her at Rome; there, because he doth know 
That she was there a thousand years ago, 
He loves her rags so, as we here obey 
The statecloth where the prince sate yesterday. 
Crantz to such brave loves will not be enthrall'd, 
But loves her only, who at Geneva is call'd 
Religion, plain, simple, sullen, young, 
Contemptuous, yet unhandsome; as among 
Lecherous humours, there is one that judges 
No wenches wholesome, but coarse country drudges. 
Graius stays still at home here, and because 
Some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and laws, 
Still new like fashions, bid him think that she 
Which dwells with us is only perfect, he 
Embraceth her whom his godfathers will 
Tender to him, being tender, as wards still 
Take such wives as their guardians offer, or 
Pay values. Careless Phrygius doth abhor 
All, because all cannot be good, as one 
Knowing some women whores, dares marry none. 
Graccus loves all as one, and thinks that so 
As women do in divers countries go 
In divers habits, yet are still one kind, 
So doth, so is Religion; and this blind- 
ness too much light breeds; but unmoved, thou 
Of force must one, and forc'd, but one allow, 
And the right; ask thy father which is she, 
Let him ask his; though truth and falsehood be 
Near twins, yet truth a little elder is; 
Be busy to seek her; believe me this, 
He's not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best. 
To adore, or scorn an image, or protest, 
May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way 
To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; 
To sleep, or run wrong, is. On a huge hill, 
Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will 
Reach her, about must and about must go, 
And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so. 
Yet strive so that before age, death's twilight, 
Thy soul rest, for none can work in that night. 
To will implies delay, therefore now do; 
Hard deeds, the body's pains; hard knowledge too 
The mind's endeavours reach, and mysteries 
Are like the sun, dazzling, yet plain to all eyes. 
Keep the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand 
In so ill case, that God hath with his hand 
Sign'd kings' blank charters to kill whom they hate; 
Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to fate. 
Fool and wretch, wilt thou let thy soul be tied 
To man's laws, by which she shall not be tried 
At the last day? Oh, will it then boot thee 
To say a Philip, or a Gregory, 
A Harry, or a Martin, taught thee this? 
Is not this excuse for mere contraries 
Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so? 
That thou mayest rightly obey power, her bounds know; 
Those past, her nature and name is chang'd; to be 
Then humble to her is idolatry. 
As streams are, power is; those blest flowers that dwell 
At the rough stream's calm head, thrive and do well, 
But having left their roots, and themselves given 
To the stream's tyrannous rage, alas, are driven 
Through mills, and rocks, and woods, and at last, almost 
Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost. 
So perish souls, which more choose men's unjust 
Power from God claim'd, than God himself to trust.

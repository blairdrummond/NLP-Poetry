title : Portrait d'une Femme

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea, 
      London has swept about you this score years 
And bright ships left you this or that in fee: 
      Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things, 
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price. 
      Great minds have sought you — lacking someone else. 
You have been second always. Tragical? 
      No. You preferred it to the usual thing: 
One dull man, dulling and uxorious, 
      One average mind —   with one thought less, each year. 
Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit 
      Hours, where something might have floated up. 
And now you pay one.   Yes, you richly pay. 
      You are a person of some interest, one comes to you 
And takes strange gain away: 
      Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion; 
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two, 
      Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else 
That might prove useful and yet never proves, 
      That never fits a corner or shows use, 
Or finds its hour upon the loom of days: 
      The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work; 
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays, 
      These are your riches, your great store; and yet 
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things, 
      Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff: 
In the slow float of differing light and deep, 
      No! there is nothing! In the whole and all, 
Nothing that's quite your own. 
                  Yet this is you.

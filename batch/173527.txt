title : Fire and Ice

author : Robert Frost

text : 
Some say the world will end in fire, 
Some say in ice. 
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate 
To say that for destruction ice 
Is also great 
And would suffice.

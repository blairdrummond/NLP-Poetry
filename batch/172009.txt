a stark 
                  Quake 

               a numb 
                  Calm 


                      * 


               clutching my Crumbl 
               ejumble 
                  among 
               Tombs and 
               in Caves 
                  my 
                Dream 
                Vision 

               Oarsman, oarsman, 
                  Where have you been? 
               I’ve been to Leafy, 
               I’ve dismembered the Queen. 

               Oarsman, oarsman 
                  What did you there? 
               I hid in a cleft, 
               I braided the air. 



hearing our oars where their freed goatsteps sped   
and are silent 
by an extinct river 
O Babylon when I lay down 
alert for sliding cataracts 
where in corridors the print of dancing feet   
beyond poise I am prey 
posing in snow-light 
being of human form 
clothed in the scales of a fish 


Count him a magician 
he controls the storm 
walked on the sea shouting   
that he is the Logos of God 
that he is the Word original and first begotten 
attended by power 
upheld by his mother 
(a very active gesturing baby)   
what if Simon Peter Jesus himself   
walked among the cold stone faces 
shouting NIKA 
emptyeyed blanksmiling 



                            Swiftness divination these false gods 
                            their commerce is the cloud 
                            so they can learn what is preparing in the sky   
                            Artificer of the universe 
                            Magician who controls the storm 
                            to see you in one spot 
                            I count the clouds others count the seasons   
                            Dreaming of archipelagos and the desert   
                            I have lived through weeks of years 
                            I have raked up fallen leaves for winter   
                            after winter across an empire of icy light 


Light of our dark is the fruit of my womb 
or night falling through the reign of splashes   
Liquid light that bathes the landscape in my figure   
Clairvoyant Ireland 
eras and eras encircled by sea 
the barrows of my ancestors have spilled their bones   
across the singing ear in hear or shell   
as wreck or wrack may be in daring   
There were giants on the earth in those days   
feasts then on hill and fort 
All night the borders of my bed 
carve paths across my face 
and I always forget to leave my address   
frightened by the way that midnight 
grips my palm and tells me that my lines   
are slipping out of question 

Divorce I manumission round 
with a gentle blow the casting branch 
my right hand My covenant 
was garment concealed or mask or matron 
Proceed with measured step   
the field and action of the law   
Like day the tables twelve   
whip torch and radiate halo   
Sky brewing coming storm   
Faraway over the hill 
when Hell was harrowed 
and earth was brought to heel   
how the hills spread away   
how the walls crumbled   
deathcolored frozen in time 
Where was the senate   zone and horizon 
Where are the people   mountain of light to the east   
Tell them I sail for the deep sea rest 
a painless extraction a joyful day   
bird of passage over all I love   
Goodbye to all the little fir trees   
of the future 

               far   off    in    the    dread 
               blindness    I   heard   light 
               eagerly   I   struck   my foot 
               against    a      stone      and 
               raised    a    din    at    the 
               sound    the   blessed    Paul 
               shut   the   door   which   had 
               been   open   and   bolted   it

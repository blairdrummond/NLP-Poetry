In the past we listened to photographs. They heard our voice speak.   
Alive, active. What had been distance was memory.    Dusk came, 
Pushed us forward,   emptying the laboratory   each night undisturbed by   
Erasure. 

      In the city of X, they lived together. Always morose, her lips 
soothed him. The piano was arranged in the old manner, light entered the   
window, street lamps at the single tree. 

      Emotion evoked by a single light on a subject is not transferable to   
photographs of the improved city. The camera, once 
commented freely amid rivering and lost gutters of treeless parks or avenue.   
The old camera refused to penetrate the unknown. Its heart was soft,   
unreliable. 

      Now distributed is photography of new government building. We are   
forbidden to observe despair silent in old photographs.

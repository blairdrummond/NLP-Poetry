text : 
Observe the cautious toadstools   
    still on the lawn today 
though they grow over-evening;   
    sun shrinks them away. 
Pale and proper and rootless,   
    they righteously extort 
their living from the living. 
    I have been their sort. 

See by our blocked foundation   
    the cold, archaic clay, 
stiff and clinging and sterile   
    as children mold at play 
or as the Lord God fashioned   
    before He breathed it breath. 
The earth we dig and carry 
    for flowers, is strong in death. 

Woman, we are the rich 
    soil, friable and humble,   
where all our murders rot, 
    where our old deaths crumble   
and fortify my reach 
    far from you, wide and free,   
though I have set my root   
    in you and am your tree.

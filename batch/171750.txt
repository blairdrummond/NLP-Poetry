title : Liberty

author : Archibald MacLeish

text : 
When liberty is headlong girl 
And runs her roads and wends her ways   
Liberty will shriek and whirl 
Her showery torch to see it blaze. 

When liberty is wedded wife 
And keeps the barn and counts the byre   
Liberty amends her life. 
She drowns her torch for fear of fire.

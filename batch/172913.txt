title : Earth's Answer

author : William Blake

text : 
Earth rais'd up her head, 
From the darkness dread & drear. 
Her light fled: 
Stony dread! 
And her locks cover'd with grey despair. 

Prison'd on watry shore 
Starry Jealousy does keep my den 
Cold and hoar 
Weeping o'er 
I hear the Father of the ancient men 

Selfish father of men 
Cruel, jealous, selfish fear 
Can delight 
Chain'd in night 
The virgins of youth and morning bear. 

Does spring hide its joy 
When buds and blossoms grow? 
Does the sower? 
Sow by night? 
Or the plowman in darkness plow? 

Break this heavy chain, 
That does freeze my bones around 
Selfish! vain! 
Eternal bane! 
That free Love with bondage bound.

title : A Note on My Son’s Face

I. 
Tonight, I look, thunderstruck 
at the gold head of my grandchild.   
Almost asleep, he buries his feet   
between my thighs; 
his little straw eyes 
close in the near dark. 
I smell the warmth of his raw   
slightly foul breath, the new death   
waiting to rot inside him. 
Our breaths equalize our heartbeats;   
every muscle of the chest uncoils,   
the arm bones loosen in the nest   
of nerves. I think of the peace   
of walking through the house, 
pointing to the name of this, the name of that, 
an educator of a new man. 

Mother. Grandmother. Wise 
Snake-woman who will show the way;   
Spider-woman whose black tentacles 
hold him precious. Or will tear off his head,   
her teeth over the little husband, 
the small fist clotted in trust at her breast. 

This morning, looking at the face of his father, 
I remembered how, an infant, his face was too dark,   
nose too broad, mouth too wide. 
I did not look in that mirror 
and see the face that could save me 
from my own darkness. 
Did he, looking in my eye, see 
what I turned from: 
my own dark grandmother 
bending over gladioli in the field, 
her shaking black hand defenseless   
at the shining cock of flower? 

I wanted that face to die, 
to be reborn in the face of a white child. 

I wanted the soul to stay the same,   
for I loved to death, 
to damnation and God-death,   
the soul that broke out of me. 
I crowed: My Son! My Beautiful!   
But when I peeked in the basket,   
I saw the face of a black man. 

Did I bend over his nose 
and straighten it with my fingers   
like a vine growing the wrong way?   
Did he feel my hand in malice? 

Generations we prayed and fucked   
for this light child, 
the shining god of the second coming;   
we bow down in shame 
and carry the children of the past   
in our wallets, begging forgiveness. 

II. 
A picture in a book, 
a lynching. 
The bland faces of men who watch   
a Christ go up in flames, smiling,   
as if he were a hooked 
fish, a felled antelope, some 
wild thing tied to boards and burned.   
His charring body 
gives off light—a halo 
burns out of him. 
His face scorched featureless; 
the hair matted to the scalp 
like feathers. 
One man stands with his hand on his hip,   
another with his arm 
slung over the shoulder of a friend,   
as if this moment were large enough   
to hold affection. 

III. 
How can we wake 
from a dream 
we are born into, 
that shines around us,   
the terrible bright air? 

Having awakened, 
having seen our own bloody hands,   
how can we ask forgiveness, 
bring before our children the real   
monster of their nightmares? 

The worst is true. 
Everything you did not want to know.

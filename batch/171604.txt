Every town with black Catholics has a St. Peter Claver’s.   
My first was nursery school. 
Miss Maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots. 
No mother questioned; no child sassed. 
In blue pleated skirts, pants, and white shirts, 
we stood in line to use the open toilets 
and conserved light by walking in darkness. 
Unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents’ places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait. 
They said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty whiteness; 
I learned to swallow and distrust my senses. 

On holy cards St. Peter’s face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky; 
I thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and dark. 
Now I read he was “a Spanish Jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the African Negroes and the abolition of the slave trade.” 
I was tricked again, robbed of my patron, 
and left with a debt to another white man.

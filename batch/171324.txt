title : Boil

text : 
Boil over—it’s what the nerves do,   
Watch them seethe when stimulated, 

Murmurs the man at the stove   
To the one at the fridge— 

Watch that electric impulse that finally makes them   
Fume and fizz at either 

Frayed end. If you could grasp a bundle 
Of nerves in your fist like a jumper cable, and sense that 

Python’s writhe, or a garden hose when the pressure’s   
High and it wilfully weaves about 

Trying its best to get away from you— 
You’d see how nothing is passive, 

We’re all—I mean from our elephant sun, ejaculant   
Great-grandfather, cascading down 

To weightless   
Unstoppable neutrinos 

Leaving their silvery trace   
In vacuum chambers, in 

Effervescent lines, twisted   
Madly in our madhouse jackets, 

Rules, laws, which we are seething to break   
Though to rupture them might be of course to die, 

Or, possibly,   
To change: 

Boil, it’s what water 
And everything else teaches.

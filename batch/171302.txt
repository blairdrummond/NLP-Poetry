title : America

Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud   
Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison 

Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger Kings, and MTV episodes   
Where you can’t tell the show from the commercials, 

And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he is,   
He says that even when he’s driving to the mall in his Isuzu 

Trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them   
Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels 

Buried alive, captured and suffocated in the folds   
Of the thick satin quilt of America 

And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain,   
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade, 

And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last night,   
It was not blood but money 

That gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar bills   
Spilling from his wounds, and—this is the weird part—, 

He gasped “Thank god—those Ben Franklins were   
Clogging up my heart— 

And so I perish happily, 
Freed from that which kept me from my liberty”— 

Which was when I knew it was a dream, since my dad   
Would never speak in rhymed couplets, 

And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes 
And I think, “I am asleep in America too, 

And I don’t know how to wake myself either,” 
And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life: 

“I was listening to the cries of the past, 
When I should have been listening to the cries of the future.” 

But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable 
Or what kind of nightmare it might be 

When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you 
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river 

Even while others are drowning underneath you 
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters 

And yet it seems to be your own hand 
Which turns the volume higher?

(Independence Day, 1964)
On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her   
her first swimming pool. It had been 
his favorite color, exactly—just 
so much of it, the swimmers’ white arms jutting   
into the chevrons of high society. 
She had rolled up her window 
and told him to drive on, fast. 

Now this act of mercy: four daughters 
dragging her to their husbands’ company picnic,   
white families on one side and them 
on the other, unpacking the same 
squeeze bottles of Heinz, the same 
waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip bags.   
So he was dead for the first time 
on Fourth of July—ten years ago 

had been harder, waiting for something to happen,   
and ten years before that, the girls 
like young horses eyeing the track. 
Last August she stood alone for hours 
in front of the T.V. set 
as a crow’s wing moved slowly through 
the white streets of government. 
That brave swimming 

scared her, like Joanna saying   
Mother, we’re Afro-Americans now! 
What did she know about Africa?   
Were there lakes like this one 
with a rowboat pushed under the pier?   
Or Thomas’ Great Mississippi 
with its sullen silks? (There was 
the Nile but the Nile belonged 

to God.) Where she came from 
was the past, 12 miles into town 
where nobody had locked their back door, 
and Goodyear hadn’t begun to dream of a park   
under the company symbol, a white foot   
sprouting two small wings.

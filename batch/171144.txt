title : The Ashes

author : Karin Gottshall

text : 
You were carried here by hands 
and now the wind has you, gritty 
as incense, dark sparkles borne 

in the shape of blowing, 
this great atmospheric bloom, 
spinning under the bridge and expanding— 

shape of wind and its pattern 
of shattering. Having sloughed off 
the urn's temporary shape, 

there is another of you now— 
tell me which to speak to: 
the one you were, or are, the one who waited 

in the ashes for this scattering, or the one 
now added to the already haunted woods, 
the woods that sigh and shift their leaves— 

where your mystery billows, then breathes.

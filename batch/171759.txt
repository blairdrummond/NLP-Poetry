"At pet stores in Detroit, you can buy   
frozen rats 
for seventy-five cents apiece, to feed   
your pet boa constrictor" 
back home in Grosse Pointe, 
or in Grosse Pointe Park, 

while the free nation of rats 
in Detroit emerges 
from alleys behind pet shops, from cellars   
and junked cars, and gathers 
to flow at twilight 
like a river the color of pavement, 

and crawls over bedrooms and groceries   
and through broken 
school windows to eat the crayon   
from drawings of rats— 
and no one in Detroit understands   
how rats are delicious in Dearborn. 

If only we could communicate, if only   
the boa constrictors of Southfield   
would slither down I-94, 
turn north on the Lodge Expressway,   
and head for Eighth Street, to eat   
out for a change. Instead, tomorrow, 

a man from Birmingham enters   
a pet shop in Detroit 
to buy a frozen German shepherd   
for six dollars and fifty cents   
to feed his pet cheetah, 
guarding the compound at home. 

Oh, they arrive all day, in their   
locked cars, buying 
schoolyards, bridges, buses,   
churches, and Ethnic Festivals;   
they buy a frozen Texaco station 
for eighty-four dollars and fifty cents 

to feed to an imported London taxi   
in Huntington Woods; 
they buy Tiger Stadium, 
frozen, to feed to the Little League   
in Grosse Ile. They bring everything   
home, frozen solid 

as pig iron, to the six-car garages 
of Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods,   
Farmington, Grosse Pointe 
Farms, Troy, and Grosse Arbor— 
and they ingest 
everything, and fall asleep, and lie 

coiled in the sun, while the city   
thaws in the stomach and slides 
to the small intestine, where enzymes   
break down molecules of protein   
to amino acids, which enter 
the cold bloodstream.

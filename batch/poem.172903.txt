Couplet, Aphorism

Have but one God: thy knees were sore 
If bent in prayer to three or four. 

Adore no images save those 
The coinage of thy country shows. 

Take not the Name in vain. Direct 
Thy swearing unto some effect. 

Thy hand from Sunday work be held-- 
Work not at all unless compelled. 

Honor thy parents, and perchance 
Their wills thy fortunes may advance. 

Kill not--death liberates thy foe 
From persecution's constant woe. 

Kiss not thy neighbor's wife. Of course 
There's no objection to divorce. 

To steal were folly, for 'tis plain 
In cheating there is greater gain. 

Bear not false witness. Shake your head 
And say that you have "heard it said." 

Who stays to covet ne'er will catch 
An opportunity to snatch.

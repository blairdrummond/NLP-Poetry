title : A Poem for Speculative Hipsters

author : Amiri Baraka

text : 
He had got, finally, 
to the forest 
of motives. There were no 
owls, or hunters. No Connie Chatterleys   
resting beautifully 
on their backs, having casually 
brought socialism 
to England.   
                  Only ideas, 
and their opposites. 
                              Like, 
                he was really 
                nowhere.

title : Fragment 9: The Netherlands

author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge

text : 

Water and windmills, greenness, Islets green;
Willows whose Trunks beside the shadows stood
Of their own higher half, and willowy swamp:
Farmhouses that at anchor seem'din the inland sky
The fog-transfixing Spires
Water, wide water, greenness and green banks,
And water seen

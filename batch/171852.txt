title : The Jain Bird Hospital in Delhi

Outside the hotel window, unenlightened pigeons 
weave and dive like Stukas on their prey,
apparently some tiny insect brother.
(In India, the attainment of nonviolence
is considered a proper goal for human beings.) 
If one of the pigeons should fly into the illusion

of my window and survive (the body is no illusion 
when it’s hurt) he could be taken across town to the bird 
hospital where Jains, skilled medical men,
repair the feathery sick and broken victims.
There, in reproof of violence
and of nothing else, live Mahavira’s brothers and sisters.

To this small, gentle order of monks and nuns
it is bright Vishnu and dark Shiva who are illusion. 
They trust in faith, cognition, and nonviolence 
to release them from rebirth. They think that birds 
and animalslike us, some predators, some prey
should be ministered to no less than men and women.

The Jains who deal with creatures (and with laymen) 
wear white, while their more enterprising hermit brothers 
walk naked and are called the sky-clad. Jains pray 
to no deity, human kindness being their sole illusion. 
Mahavira and those twenty-three other airy creatures
who turned to saints with him, preached the doctrine of ahimsa,

which in our belligerent tongue becomes nonviolence. 
It’s not a doctrine congenial to snarers and poultrymen, 
who every day bring to market maimed pheasants. 
Numbers of these are brought in by the Jain brothers 
and brought, to grow back wing-tips and illusions, 
to one of the hospitals succoring such small quarry.

When strong and feathered again, the lucky victims
get reborn on Sunday mornings to the world’s violence,
released from the roofs of these temples to illusion.
It is hard for a westerner to speak about men and women 
like these, who call the birds of the air brothers. 
We recall the embarrassed fanfare for Francis and his flock.

We’re poor forked sky-clad things ourselves
and God knows prey to illusione.g., I claim these brothers 
and sisters in India, stemming a little violence, among birds.

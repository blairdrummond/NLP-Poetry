“There’s never a dull moment in the human body.”  —The Insight Lady
Dear old equivocal and closest friend,   
Grand Vizier to a weak bewildered king,   
Now we approach The Ecclesiastean Age 
Where the heart is like to go off inside your chest   
Like a party favor, or the brain blow a fuse   
And the comic-book light-bulb of Idea black out   
Forever, the idiot balloon of speech   
Go blank, and we shall know, if it be knowing,   
The world as it was before language once again; 

Mighty Fortress, maybe already mined   
And readying to blow up grievances   
About the lifetime of your servitude, 
The body of this death one talkative saint   
Wanted to be delivered of (not yet!),   
Aggressively asserting your ancient right   
To our humiliation by the bowel 
Or the rough justice of the elderly lecher’s   
Retiring from this incontinence to that; 

Dark horse, it’s you we’ve put the money on   
Regardless, the parody and satire and 
The nevertheless forgiveness of the soul   
Or mind, self, spirit, will or whatever else 
The ever-unknowable unknown is calling itself 
This time around—shall we renew our vows?   
How should we know by now how we might do   
Divorced? Homely animal, in sickness and health,   
For the duration; buddy, you know the drill.

title : The Song of the Smoke

author : W. E. B. Du Bois

text : 
   I am the Smoke King 
   I am black!
I am swinging in the sky,
I am wringing worlds awry;
I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
I am the soul of the soul-toil kills,
Wraith of the ripple of trading rills;
Up I’m curling from the sod, 
I am whirling home to God;
   I am the Smoke King
   I am black.

   I am the Smoke King, 
   I am black!
I am wreathing broken hearts,
I am sheathing love’s light darts;
   Inspiration of iron times 
   Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
   Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes—
Lurid lowering ’mid the blue, 
Torrid towering toward the true,
   I am the Smoke King, 
   I am black.

   I am the Smoke King,
   I am black!
I am darkening with song,
I am hearkening to wrong!
   I will be black as blackness can—
   The blacker the mantle, the mightier the man! 
   For blackness was ancient ere whiteness began. 
I am daubing God in night,
I am swabbing Hell in white:
   I am the Smoke King
   I am black.

   I am the Smoke King
   I am black!
I am cursing ruddy morn,
I am hearsing hearts unborn:
   Souls unto me are as stars in a night,
   I whiten my black men—I blacken my white! 
   What’s the hue of a hide to a man in his might? 
Hail! great, gritty, grimy hands—
Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!
   I am the Smoke King
   I am black.

text : 
Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain, 
She's gotten poets o' her ain— 
Chiels wha their chanters winna hain, 
            But tune their lays, 
Till echoes a' resound again 
            Her weel-sung praise. 

Nae poet thought her worth his while 
To set her name in measur'd style: 
She lay like some unken'd-of isle 
            Beside New Holland, 
Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil 
            Besouth Magellan. 

Ramsay and famous Fergusson 
Gied Forth and Tay a lift aboon; 
Yarrow and Tweed to mony a tune 
            Owre Scotland rings; 
While Irvin, Lugar, Ayr an' Doon 
            Naebody sings. 

Th' Ilissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine 
Glide sweet in mony a tunefu' line; 
But, Willie, set your fit to mine 
            And cock your crest, 
We'll gar our streams and burnies shine 
            Up wi' the best! 

We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells, 
Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells, 
Her banks an' braes, her dens an' dells, 
            Where glorious Wallace 
Aft bure the gree, as story tells, 
            Frae Southron billies. 

At Wallace' name what Scottish blood 
But boils up in a spring-tide flood! 
Oft have our fearless fathers strode 
            By Wallace' side, 
Still pressing onward red-wat-shod, 
            Or glorious dy'd. 

O sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,. 
When lintwhites chant amang the buds, 
And jinkin hares in amorous whids 
            Their loves enjoy, 
While thro' the braes the cushat croods 
            Wi' wailfu' cry! 

Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me, 
When winds rave thro' the naked tree; 
Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree 
            Are hoary gray; 
Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee, 
            Dark'ning the day! 

O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms 
To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms! 
Whether the summer kindly warms 
            Wi' life an' light, 
Or winter howls in gusty storms 
            The lang, dark night! 

The Muse, nae poet ever fand her, 
Till by himsel he learn'd to wander 
Adoun some trottin burn's meander, 
            And no think lang; 
O sweet to stray and pensive ponder 
            A heart-felt sang! 

The warly race may drudge and drive, 
Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch an' strive: 
Let me fair nature's face descrive, 
            And I wi' pleasure 
Shall let the busy, grumbling hive 
            Bum owre their treasure.

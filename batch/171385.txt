title : Poem (At night Chinamen jump)

author : Frank O'Hara

text : 
At night Chinamen jump   
on Asia with a thump 

while in our willful way   
we, in secret, play 

affectionate games and bruise   
our knees like China’s shoes. 

The birds push apples through   
grass the moon turns blue, 

these apples roll beneath   
our buttocks like a heath 

full of Chinese thrushes   
flushed from China’s bushes. 

As we love at night   
birds sing out of sight, 

Chinese rhythms beat   
through us in our heat, 

the apples and the birds   
move us like soft words, 

we couple in the grace   
of that mysterious race.

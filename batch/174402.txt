title : One Sung of thee who Left the Tale Untold

author : Percy Bysshe Shelley

text : 
One sung of thee who left the tale untold,
         Like the false dawns which perish in the bursting;
Like empty cups of wrought and daedal gold,
         Which mock the lips with air, when they are thirsting.

text : 
Aristotle was a little man with 
eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak 
down the midst of things, a smooth place for his feet   
much more important than the carved handles   
on the coffins of the great. 

He said you should put your hand out   
at the time and place of need: 
strength matters little, he said, 
nor even speed. 

His pupil, a king's son, died 
at an early age. That Aristotle spoke of him   
it is impossible to find—the youth was   
notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a gang,   
but even this Aristotle didn't ever say. 

Around the farthest forest and along   
all the bed of the sea, Aristotle studied   
immediate, local ways. Many of which   
were wrong. So he studied poetry.   
There, in pity and fear, he found Man. 

Many thinkers today, who stand low and grin,   
have little use for anger or power, its palace   
or its prison— 
but quite a bit for that little man 
with eyes like a lizard.

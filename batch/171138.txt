title : The Woman Who Collects Noah's Arks

author : Janet McCann

Has them in every room of her house, 
wall hangings, statues, paintings, quilts and blankets, 
ark lampshades, mobiles, Christmas tree ornaments, 
t-shirts, sweaters, necklaces, books, 
comics, a creamer, a sugar bowl, candles, napkins, 
tea-towels and tea-tray, nightgown, pillow, lamp. 
         Animals two-by-two in plaster, wood, 
fabric, oil paint, copper, glass, plastic, paper, 
tinfoil, leather, mother-of-pearl, styrofoam, 
clay, steel, rubber, wax, soap. 
         Why I cannot ask, though I would like 
to know, the answer has to be simply 
because. Because at night when she lies 
with her husband in bed, the house rocks out 
into the bay, the one that cuts in here to the flatlands 
at the center of Texas. Because the whole wood structure 
drifts off, out under the stars, beyond the last 
lights, the two of them pitching and rolling 
as it all heads seaward. Because they hear 
trumpets and bellows from the farther rooms. 
Because the sky blackens, but morning finds them always 
safe on the raindrenched land, 
bird on the windowsill.

title : from Doctor Drink, #1

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
In the thirtieth year of life 
I took my heart to be my wife, 

And as I turn in bed by night 
I have my heart for my delight. 

No other heart may mine estrange 
For my heart changes as I change, 

And it is bound, and I am free, 
And with my death it dies with me.

I 
Is the total black, being spoken 
From the earth's inside. 
There are many kinds of open. 
How a diamond comes into a knot of flame   
How a sound comes into a word, coloured   
By who pays what for speaking. 

Some words are open 
Like a diamond on glass windows 
Singing out within the crash of passing sun 
Then there are words like stapled wagers 
In a perforated book—buy and sign and tear apart— 
And come whatever wills all chances 
The stub remains 
An ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge. 
Some words live in my throat 
Breeding like adders. Others know sun 
Seeking like gypsies over my tongue 
To explode through my lips 
Like young sparrows bursting from shell. 
Some words 
Bedevil me. 

Love is a word another kind of open— 
As a diamond comes into a knot of flame 
I am black because I come from the earth's inside   
Take my word for jewel in your open light.

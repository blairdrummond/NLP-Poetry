title : Happy Hour

author : Alan R. Shapiro

text : 
The gregarious dark is shifting   
when she puts her second drink,   
the free one, half on the coaster.   
The tipped wine poised at the brim   
is the beginning of the bad girl   
she’ll promise never to be again   
tomorrow, who can taunt him now   
to prove he doesn’t love her 
and never could: her hand slides   
up his thigh until he tenses— 
‘My little prig, don’t you want   
to fuck me?’ the bad girl 
she couldn’t be at home, his wife on ice.   
All he can do is smile back 
as though she’s made a harmless   
good-natured joke, and struggle   
not to look around to see 
who’s heard, who’s watching. He wants   
to smash the wine glass in her face   
so he can know for once 
exactly what he’s done wrong;   
but he places it instead 
back safely on the coaster 
quickly before she sees. 
Never cautious enough, he is prepared   
even if she knocks it over 
to go down on his hands and knees   
and wipe it up, kind and forgiving.   
In all ways careful to acquit himself   
so that tomorrow when she says 
she doesn’t deserve him, he’s too good,   
he can believe her. Tomorrow   
will be his happy hour. There won’t be   
anything she wouldn’t do for him.

text : 
One of her hands one of her cheeks lay under, 
      Cosening the pillow of a lawful kiss, 
Which therefore swell’d, and seem’d to part asunder, 
      As angry to be robb’d of such a bliss! 
         The one look’d pale and for revenge did long, 
         While t’other blush’d, ’cause it had done the wrong. 

Out of the bed the other fair hand was 
      On a green satin quilt, whose perfect white 
Look’d like a daisy in a field of grass, 
      And show’d like unmelt snow unto the sight; 
         There lay this pretty perdue, safe to keep 
         The rest o’ th’ body that lay fast asleep. 

Her eyes (and therefore it was night), close laid 
      Strove to imprison beauty till the morn: 
But yet the doors were of such fine stuff made, 
      That it broke through, and show’d itself in scorn, 
         Throwing a kind of light about the place, 
         Which turn’d to smiles still, as’t came near her face. 

Her beams, which some dull men call’d hair, divided, 
      Part with her cheeks, part with her lips did sport. 
But these, as rude, her breath put by still; some 
      Wiselier downwards sought, but falling short, 
         Curled back in rings, and seemed to turn again 
         To bite the part so unkindly held them in.

title : Old Couple

author : Charles Simic

text : 
They’re waiting to be murdered,   
Or evicted. Soon 
They expect to have nothing to eat.   
In the meantime, they sit. 

A violent pain is coming, they think. 
It will start in the heart 
And climb into the mouth. 
They’ll be carried off in stretchers, howling. 

Tonight they watch the window   
Without exchanging a word.   
It has rained, and now it looks   
Like it’s going to snow a little. 

I see him get up to lower the shades.   
If their window stays dark, 
I know his hand has reached hers 
Just as she was about to turn on the lights.

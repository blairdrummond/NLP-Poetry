It seemed those rose-pink dishes   
she kept for special company   
were always cold, brought down   
from the shelf in jingling stacks,   
the plates like the panes of ice   
she broke from the water bucket   
winter mornings, the flaring cups   
like tulips that opened too early 
and got bitten by frost. They chilled   
the coffee no matter how quickly   
you drank, while a heavy 
everyday mug would have kept   
a splash hot for the better 
part of a conversation. It was hard   
to hold up your end of the gossip   
with your coffee cold, but it was   
a special occasion, just the same,   
to sit at her kitchen table 
and sip the bitter percolation 
of the past week’s rumors from cups   
it had taken a year to collect   
at the grocery, with one piece free   
for each five pounds of flour.

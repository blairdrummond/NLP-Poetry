title : To Mr. Lawrence

author : John Milton

text : 
Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
       Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire,
       Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
       Help waste a sullen day; what may be won
From the hard season gaining? Time will run
       On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
       The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire
       The lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.
What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
       Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
       To hear the lute well touch'd, or artful voice
Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?
       He who of those delights can judge, and spare
       To interpose them oft, is not unwise.

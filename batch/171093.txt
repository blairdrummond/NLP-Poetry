title : Stable

author : Claudia Emerson

text : 
One rusty horseshoe hangs on a nail 
above the door, still losing its luck, 
and a work-collar swings, an empty 
old noose. The silence waits, wild to be 
broken by hoofbeat and heavy 
harness slap, will founder but remain; 
while, outside, above the stable, 
eight, nine, now ten buzzards swing low 
in lazy loops, a loose black warp 
of patience, bearing the blank sky 
like a pall of wind on mourning 
wings. But the bones of this place are 
long picked clean. Only the hayrake's 
ribs still rise from the rampant grasses.

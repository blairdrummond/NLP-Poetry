title : OEnone

author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson

text : 
There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier 
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills. 
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen, 
Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine, 
And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand 
The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down 
Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars 
The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine 
In cataract after cataract to the sea. 
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus 
Stands up and takes the morning: but in front 
The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal 
Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel, 
The crown of Troas. 

                               Hither came at noon 
Mournful OEnone, wandering forlorn 
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills. 
Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck 
Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest. 
She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine, 
Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade 
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff. 

"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill: 
The grasshopper is silent in the grass: 
The lizard, with his shadow on the stone, 
Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead. 
The purple flower droops: the golden bee 
Is lily-cradled: I alone awake. 
My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love, 
My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim, 
And I am all aweary of my life. 

"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Hear me, O Earth, hear me, O Hills, O Caves 
That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks, 
I am the daughter of a River-God, 
Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all 
My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls 
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed, 
A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be 
That, while I speak of it, a little while 
My heart may wander from its deeper woe. 

      "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
I waited underneath the dawning hills, 
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark, 
And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine: 
Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris, 
Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved, 
Came up from reedy Simois all alone. 

      "O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft: 
Far up the solitary morning smote 
The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes 
I sat alone: white-breasted like a star 
Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin 
Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair 
Cluster'd about his temples like a God's: 
And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens 
When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart 
Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came. 

      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm 
Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold, 
That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd 
And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech 
Came down upon my heart. 

                                     My own OEnone, 
Beautiful-brow'd OEnone, my own soul, 
Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n 
"For the most fair," would seem to award it thine, 
As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt 
The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace 
Of movement, and the charm of married brows.' 

      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He prest the blossom of his lips to mine, 
And added 'This was cast upon the board, 
When all the full-faced presence of the Gods 
Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon 
Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due: 
But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve, 
Delivering that to me, by common voice 
Elected umpire, Herè comes to-day, 
Pallas and Aphroditè, claiming each 
This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave 
Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine, 
Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard 
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.' 

"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud 
Had lost his way between the piney sides 
Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came, 
Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower, 
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire, 
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel, 
Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose, 
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine, 
This way and that, in many a wild festoon 
Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs 
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'. 

      "O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit, 
And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd 
Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew. 
Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom 
Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows 
Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods 
Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made 
Proffer of royal power, ample rule 
Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue 
Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale 
And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn, 
Or labour'd mine undrainable of ore. 
Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll, 
From many an inland town and haven large, 
Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel 
In glassy bays among her tallest towers.' 

      "O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Still she spake on and still she spake of power, 
'Which in all action is the end of all; 
Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred 
And throned of wisdom—from all neighbour crowns 
Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand 
Fail from the sceptre-staff. Such boon from me, 
From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris, to thee king-born, 
A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born, 
Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power 
Only, are likest Gods, who have attain'd 
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats 
Above the thunder, with undying bliss 
In knowledge of their own supremacy.' 

      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit 
Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power 
Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood 
Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs 
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear 
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold, 
The while, above, her full and earnest eye 
Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek 
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply. 

      "Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, 
These three alone lead life to sovereign power. 
Yet not for power (power of herself 
Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law, 
Acting the law we live by without fear; 
And, because right is right, to follow right 
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.' 

      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts. 
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me 
To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am, 
So shalt thou find me fairest. 

                                              Yet, indeed, 
If gazing on divinity disrobed 
Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair, 
Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure 
That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee, 
So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood, 
Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's, 
To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks, 
Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow 
Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will, 
Circled thro' all experiences, pure law, 
Commeasure perfect freedom.' 

                                           Here she ceas'd 
And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris, 
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not, 
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me! 

      "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Idalian Aphroditè beautiful, 
Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells, 
With rosy slender fingers backward drew 
From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair 
Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat 
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot 
Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form 
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches 
Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved. 

      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes, 
The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh 
Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee 
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.' 
She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear: 
But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm, 
And I beheld great Herè's angry eyes, 
As she withdrew into the golden cloud, 
And I was left alone within the bower; 
And from that time to this I am alone, 
And I shall be alone until I die. 

      "Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Fairest—why fairest wife? am I not fair? 
My love hath told me so a thousand times. 
Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday, 
When I past by, a wild and wanton pard, 
Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail 
Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she? 
Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms 
Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest 
Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew 
Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains 
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois! 

      "O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
They came, they cut away my tallest pines, 
My tall dark pines, that plumed the craggy ledge 
High over the blue gorge, and all between 
The snowy peak and snow-white cataract 
Foster'd the callow eaglet—from beneath 
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn 
The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat 
Low in the valley. Never, never more 
Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist 
Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid 
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud, 
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars. 

      "O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds, 
Among the fragments tumbled from the glens, 
Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her 
The Abominable, that uninvited came 
Into the fair Pele{:i}an banquet-hall, 
And cast the golden fruit upon the board, 
And bred this change; that I might speak my mind, 
And tell her to her face how much I hate 
Her presence, hated both of Gods and men. 

      "O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times, 
In this green valley, under this green hill, 
Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone? 
Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears? 
O happy tears, and how unlike to these! 
O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face? 
O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight? 
O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud, 
There are enough unhappy on this earth, 
Pass by the happy souls, that love to live: 
I pray thee, pass before my light of life, 
And shadow all my soul, that I may die. 
Thou weighest heavy on the heart within, 
Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die. 

      "O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts 
Do shape themselves within me, more and more, 
Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear 
Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills, 
Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see 
My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother 
Conjectures of the features of her child 
Ere it is born: her child!—a shudder comes 
Across me: never child be born of me, 
Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes! 

      "O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone, 
Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me 
Walking the cold and starless road of death 
Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love 
With the Greek woman. I will rise and go 
Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth 
Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says 
A fire dances before her, and a sound 
Rings ever in her ears of armed men. 
What this may be I know not, but I know 
That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day, 
All earth and air seem only burning fire."

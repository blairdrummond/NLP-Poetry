title : Misreading Housman

author : Linda Pastan

text : 
On this first day of spring, snow 
covers the fruit trees, mingling improbably   
with the new blossoms like identical twins   
brought up in different hemispheres.   
It is not what Housman meant 
when he wrote of the cherry 
hung with snow, though he also knew   
how death can mistake the seasons,   
and if he made it all sound pretty,   
that was our misreading 
in those high school classrooms 
where, drunk on boredom, we had to recite   
his poems. Now the weather is always looming 

in the background, trying to become more   
than merely scenery, and though today   
it is telling us something 
we don't want to hear, it is all 
so unpredictable, so out of control 
that we might as well be children again,   
hearing the voices of thunder 
like baritone uncles shouting 
in the next room as we try to sleep,   
or hearing the silence of snow falling   
soft as a coverlet, even in springtime   
whispering: relax, there is nothing   
you can possibly do about any of this.

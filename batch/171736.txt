title : The Tale of Sunlight

Listen, nephew.
When I opened the cantina
At noon
A triangle of sunlight
Was stretched out
On the floor
Like a rug
Like a tired cat.
It flared in
From the window 
Through a small hole 
Shaped like a yawn. 
Strange I thought 
And placed my hand 
Before the opening, 
But the sunlight 
Did not vanish. 
I pulled back
The shutters
And the room glowed,
But this pyramid 
Of whiteness
Was simply brighter.
The sunlight around it 
Appeared soiled 
Like the bed sheet 
Of a borracho.
Amazed, I locked the door, 
Closed the windows. 
Workers, in from 
The fields, knocked 
To be let in,
Children peeked 
Through the shutters,
But I remained silent.
I poured a beer, 
At a table
Shuffled a pack 
Of old cards,
And watched it 
Cross the floor, 
Hang on the wall 
Like a portrait 
Like a calendar 
Without numbers. 
When a fly settled 
In the sunlight 
And disappeared
In a wreath of smoke,
I tapped it with the broom, 
Spat on it.
The broom vanished.
The spit sizzled.
It is the truth, little one.
I stood eye to blank eye 
And by misfortune
This finger
This pink stump 
Entered the sunlight, 
Snapped off 
With a dry sneeze,
And fell to the floor
As a gift
To the ants
Who know me
For what I gave.

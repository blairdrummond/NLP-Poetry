What never comes when called. 
                                             What hides when held.   
Guest 
          most at home where least 
                                              expected. Vagrant   
balm of Gilead. 
                               What, soon as here, 
                                                             becomes 
the body’s native ground and, 
                                           soon as not,   
its banishment. 
                        Coming and going, 
                                                   indifferent,   
magisterial. 
                   My lovely daughter— 
walking me to the car 
                                 to say goodbye   
the day I left 
                      to keep watch at my brother’s 
bedside— 
               suddenly 
                            singing “I 
feel pretty, oh so 
                            pretty” 
                                        as she raised   
her arms up in a loose oval 
                                        over her head   
and pirouetted all along the walk. 

Savage 
          and magisterial— 
                                     the joy of it, 
the animal candor of 
                                 each arabesque, 
each leaping turn and counterturn, 
                                                    her voice 
now wobbly 
                with laughter, 
                                       “And I pity 
any girl 
             who isn’t me 
                               tonight.” 
Savagely beautiful, 
                              not so much like   
the lion that the camera 
                                     freezes 
                                                 in mid- 
pounce, claws 
                     outstretched for the stumbling 
                                                                   antelope, 
as like the herd 
                         escaping 
                                     that the camera 
pans to, zig- 
                     zagging, 
                                  swerving as one,   
their leaping strides now 
                                       leaping higher, 
                                                               faster,   
even after, 
                it seems, 
                               the fear subsides— 
after the fear and 
                            the relief 
                                             they keep   
on running 
                for nothing but 
                                          the joy of running,   
though 
          it could be 
                               any one of them   
is running 
                  from its fallen 
                                           mother or father,   
sister or brother, 
                            across the wide 
                                                      savanna,   
under a bright sun 
                              into fresher grass.

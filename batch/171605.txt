title : The Weakness

That time my grandmother dragged me 
through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up   
by my arm, hissing, “Stand up,” 
through clenched teeth, her eyes 
bright as a dog’s 
cornered in the light. 
She said it over and over, 
as if she were Jesus, 
and I were dead. She had been 
solid as a tree, 
a fur around her neck, a 
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling 
marble and passed through 
brass openings—in 1945. 
There was not even a black 
elevator operator at Saks. 
The saleswoman had brought velvet   
leggings to lace me in, and cooed, 
as if in the service of all grandmothers.   
My grandmother had smiled, but not   
hungrily, not like my mother 
who hated them, but wanted to please,   
and they had smiled back, as if 
they were wearing wooden collars.   
When my legs gave out, my grandmother   
dragged me up and held me like God   
holds saints by the 
roots of the hair. I begged her 
to believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,   
her face white 
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing 
away from those eyes   
that saw through   
her clothes, under 
her skin, all the way down   
to the transparent   
genes confessing.

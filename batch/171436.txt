title : At Darien Bridge

author : James L. Dickey

text : 
The sea here used to look 
As if many convicts had built it, 

Standing deep in their ankle chains,   
Ankle-deep in the water, to smite 

The land and break it down to salt.   
I was in this bog as a child 

When they were all working all day   
To drive the pilings down. 

I thought I saw the still sun 
Strike the side of a hammer in flight 

And from it a sea bird be born   
To take off over the marshes. 

As the gray climbs the side of my head   
And cuts my brain off from the world, 

I walk and wish mainly for birds, 
For the one bird no one has looked for 

To spring again from a flash 
Of metal, perhaps from the scratched 

Wedding band on my ring finger.   
Recalling the chains of their feet, 

I stand and look out over grasses 
At the bridge they built, long abandoned, 

Breaking down into water at last,   
And long, like them, for freedom 

Or death, or to believe again 
That they worked on the ocean to give it 

The unchanging, hopeless look   
Out of which all miracles leap.

title : Paradise Regain'd: Book II (1671)

author : John Milton

text : 
MEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet remain'd 
At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen 
Him whom they heard so late expresly call'd 
Jesus Messiah Son of God declar'd, 
And on that high Authority had believ'd, 
And with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I mean 
Andrew and Simon, famous after known 
With others though in Holy Writ not nam'd, 
Now missing him thir joy so lately found, 
So lately found, and so abruptly gone, 
Began to doubt, and doubted many days, 
And as the days increas'd, increas'd thir doubt: 
Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, 
And for a time caught up to God, as once 
Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; 
And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels 
Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. 
Therefore as those young Prophets then with care 
Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these 
Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico 
The City of Palms, Ænon, and Salem Old, 
Machærus and each Town or City wall'd 
On this side the broad lake Genezaret, 
Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. 
Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: 
Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play 
Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, 
Close in a Cottage low together got 
Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. 
Alas, from what high hope to what relapse 
Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld 
Messiah certainly now come, so long 
Expected of our Fathers; we have heard 
His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, 
Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, 
The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: 
Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd 
Into perplexity and new amaze: 
For whither is he gone, what accident 
Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire 
After appearance, and again prolong 
Our expectation?   God of Israel, 
Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; 
Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress 
Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust 
They have exalted, and behind them cast 
All fear of thee, arise and vindicate 
Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, 
But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, 
Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, 
By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, 
In publick, and with him we have convers'd; 
Let us be glad of this, and all our fears 
Lay on his Providence; he will not fail 
Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, 
Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, 
Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. 
   Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume 
To find whom at the first they found unsought: 
But to his Mother Mary, when she saw 
Others return'd from Baptism, not her Son, 
Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; 
Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, 
Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd 
Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. 
   O what avails me now that honour high 
To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute 
Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; 
While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, 
And fears as eminent, above the lot 
Of other women, by the birth I bore, 
In such a season born when scarce a Shed 
Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me 
From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, 
A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye 
Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King 
Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd 
With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; 
From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth 
Hath been our dwelling many years, his life 
Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, 
Little suspicious to any King; but now 
Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, 
By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, 
Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; 
I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, 
But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, 
That to the fall and rising he should be 
Of many in Israel, and to a sign 
Spoken against, that through my very Soul 
A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, 
My Exaltation to Afflictions high; 
Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; 
I will not argue that, nor will repine. 
But where delays he now? some great intent 
Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, 
I lost him, but so found, as well I saw 
He could not lose himself; but went about 
His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, 
Since understand; much more his absence now 
Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. 
But I to wait with patience am inur'd; 
My heart hath been a store-house long of things 
And sayings laid up, portending strange events. 
   Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind 
Recalling what remarkably had pass'd 
Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts 
Meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: 
The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, 
Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, 
Into himself descended, and at once 
All his great work to come before him set; 
How to begin, how to accomplish best 
His end of being on Earth, and mission high: 
For Satan with slye preface to return 
Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon 
Up to the middle Region of thick Air, 
Where all his Potentates in Council sate; 
There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, 
Sollicitous and blank he thus began. 
   Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Æthereal Thrones, 
Demonian Spirits now, from the Element 
Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, 
Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, 
So may we hold our place and these mild seats 
Without new trouble; such an Enemy 
Is ris'n to invade us, who no less 
Threat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell; 
I, as I undertook, and with the vote 
Consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, 
Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find 
Far other labour to be undergon 
Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, 
Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, 
However to this Man inferior far, 
If he be Man by Mothers side at least, 
With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn'd, 
Perfections absolute, Graces divine, 
And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. 
Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence 
Of my success with Eve in Paradise 
Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure 
Of like succeeding here; I summon all 
Rather to be in readiness, with hand 
Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst 
Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd. 
   So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all 
With clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid 
At his command; when from amidst them rose 
Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, 
The sensuallest, and after Asmodai 
The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd. 
   Set women in his eye and in his walk, 
Among daughters of men the fairest found; 
Many are in each Region passing fair 
As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses 
Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, 
Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues 
Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild 
And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, 
Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw 
Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. 
Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame 
Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, 
Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, 
Draw out with credulous desire, and lead 
At will the manliest, resolutest brest, 
As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. 
Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart 
Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, 
And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. 
   To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd. 
Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st 
All others by thy self; because of old 
Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring 
Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, 
None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. 
Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, 
False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth 
Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, 
And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. 
Have we not seen, or by relation heard, 
In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, 
In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, 
In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay 
Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, 
Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, 
Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more 
Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, 
Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, 
Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan?   But these haunts 
Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, 
How many have with a smile made small account 
Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd 
All her assaults, on worthier things intent? 
Remember that Pellean Conquerour, 
A youth, how all the Beauties of the East 
He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; 
How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd 
In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. 
For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full 
Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond 
Higher design then to enjoy his State; 
Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; 
But he whom we attempt is wiser far 
Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, 
Made and set wholly on the accomplishment 
Of greatest things; what woman will you find, 
Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, 
On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye 
Of fond desire? or should she confident, 
As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, 
Descend with all her winning charms begirt 
To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once 
Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; 
How would one look from his Majestick brow 
Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, 
Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout 
All her array; her female pride deject, 
Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands 
In the admiration only of weak minds 
Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes 
Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, 
At every sudden slighting quite abasht: 
Therefore with manlier objects we must try 
His constancy, with such as have more shew 
Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; 
Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; 
Or that which only seems to satisfie 
Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; 
And now I know he hungers where no food 
Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; 
The rest commit to me, I shall let pass 
No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. 
   He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; 
Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band 
Of Spirits likest to himself in guile 
To be at hand, and at his beck appear, 
If cause were to unfold some active Scene 
Of various persons each to know his part; 
Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; 
Where still from shade to shade the Son of God 
After forty days fasting had remain'd, 
Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. 
   Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd 
Wandring this woody maze, and humane food 
Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast 
To Vertue I impute not, or count part 
Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, 
Or God support Nature without repast 
Though needing, what praise is it to endure? 
But now I feel I hunger, which declares, 
Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God 
Can satisfie that need some other way, 
Though hunger still remain: so it remain 
Without this bodies wasting, I content me, 
And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, 
Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed 
Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. 
   It was the hour of night, when thus the Son 
Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down 
Under the hospitable covert nigh 
Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, 
And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, 
Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; 
Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood 
And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks 
Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, 
Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: 
He saw the Prophet also how he fled 
Into the Desert, and how there he slept 
Under a Juniper; then how awakt, 
He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, 
And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, 
And eat the second time after repose, 
The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; 
Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, 
Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. 
Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark 
Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry 
The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: 
As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose 
Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, 
Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. 
Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, 
From whose high top to ken the prospect round, 
If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; 
But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, 
Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, 
With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; 
Thither he bent his way, determin'd there 
To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade 
High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown 
That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, 
Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) 
And to a Superstitious eye the haunt 
Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, 
When suddenly a man before him stood, 
Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, 
As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, 
And with fair speech these words to him address'd. 
   With granted leave officious I return, 
But much more wonder that the Son of God 
In this wild solitude so long should bide 
Of all things destitute, and well I know, 
Not without hunger.   Others of some note, 
As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; 
The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son 
Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief 
By a providing Angel; all the race 
Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God 
Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold 
Native of Thebes wandring here was fed 
Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. 
Of thee these forty days none hath regard, 
Forty and more deserted here indeed. 
   To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? 
They all had need, I as thou seest have none. 
   How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, 
Tell me if Food were now before thee set, 
Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like 
The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that 
Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, 
Hast thou not right to all Created things, 
Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee 
Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, 
But tender all their power? nor mention I 
Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first 
To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; 
Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who 
Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold 
Nature asham'd, or better to express, 
Troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd 
From all the Elements her choicest store 
To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord 
With honour, only deign to sit and eat. 
   He spake no dream, for as his words had end, 
Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld 
In ample space under the broadest shade 
A Table richly spred, in regal mode, 
With dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort 
And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, 
In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, 
Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, 
Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, 
And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd 
Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. 
Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, 
Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! 
And at a stately side-board by the wine 
That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood 
Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew 
Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more 
Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood 
Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades 
With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, 
And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd 
Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since 
Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide 
By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, 
Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, 
And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard 
Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds 
Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd 
From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. 
Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now 
His invitation earnestly renew'd. 
   What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? 
These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict 
Defends the touching of these viands pure, 
Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, 
But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, 
Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. 
All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, 
Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay 
Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: 
What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. 
   To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: 
Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? 
And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? 
Shall I receive by gift what of my own, 
When and where likes me best, I can command? 
I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, 
Command a Table in this Wilderness, 
And call swift flights of Angels ministrant 
Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: 
Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, 
In vain, where no acceptance it can find, 
And with my hunger what has thou to do? 
Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, 
And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. 
   To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: 
That I have also power to give thou seest, 
If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary 
What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd, 
And rather opportunely in this place 
Chose to impart to thy apparent need, 
Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see 
What I can do or offer is suspect; 
Of these things others quickly will dispose 
Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that 
Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite 
With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; 
Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, 
And with these words his temptation pursu'd. 
   By hunger, that each other Creature tames, 
Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; 
Thy temperance invincible besides, 
For no allurement yields to appetite, 
And all thy heart is set on high designs, 
High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? 
Great acts require great means of enterprise, 
Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, 
A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self 
Bred up in poverty and streights at home; 
Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: 
Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire 
To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, 
What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, 
Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, 
Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? 
Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; 
What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, 
And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; 
(Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? 
Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, 
Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, 
Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, 
Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; 
They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, 
While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. 
   To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; 
Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, 
To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. 
Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, 
In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: 
But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd 
In lowest poverty to highest deeds; 
Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, 
Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat 
So many Ages, and shall yet regain 
That seat, and reign in Israel without end. 
Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World 
To me is not unknown what hath been done 
Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember 
Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? 
For I esteem those names of men so poor 
Who could do mighty things, and could contemn 
Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. 
And what in me seems wanting, but that I 
May also in this poverty as soon 
Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? 
Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, 
The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt 
To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, 
Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. 
What if with like aversion I reject 
Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, 
Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, 
Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights 
To him who wears the Regal Diadem, 
When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; 
For therein stands the office of a King, 
His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, 
That for the Publick all this weight he bears. 
Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules 
Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; 
Which every wise and vertuous man attains: 
And who attains not, ill aspires to rule 
Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, 
Subject himself to Anarchy within, 
Or lawless passions in him which he serves. 
But to guide Nations in the way of truth 
By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead 
To know, and knowing worship God aright, 
Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, 
Governs the inner man, the nobler part, 
That other o're the body only reigns, 
And oft by force, which to a generous mind 
So reigning can be no sincere delight. 
Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought 
Greater and nobler done, and to lay down 
Far more magnanimous, then to assume. 
Riches are needless then, both for themselves, 
And for thy reason why they should be sought, 
To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.

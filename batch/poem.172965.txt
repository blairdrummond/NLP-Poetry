YES, thou art gone! and never more
      Thy sunny smile shall gladden me;
But I may pass the old church door,
      And pace the floor that covers thee.

May stand upon the cold, damp stone,
      And think that, frozen, lies below
The lightest heart that I have known,
      The kindest I shall ever know.

Yet, though I cannot see thee more,
      'Tis still a comfort to have seen;
And though thy transient life is o'er,
      'Tis sweet to think that thou hast been;

To think a soul so near divine,
      Within a form so angel fair,
United to a heart like thine,
      Has gladdened once our humble sphere.

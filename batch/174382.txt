title : Art thou pale for weariness

author : Percy Bysshe Shelley

text : 
         Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
         Wandering companionless
Among the stars that have a different birth,
And ever changing, like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy?

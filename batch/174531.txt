title : Advice to the Grub Street Verse-writers

author : Jonathan Swift

text : 
Ye poets ragged and forlorn, 
      Down from your garrets haste; 
Ye rhymers, dead as soon as born, 
      Not yet consign'd to paste; 

   I know a trick to make you thrive; 
      O, 'tis a quaint device: 
Your still-born poems shall revive, 
      And scorn to wrap up spice. 

   Get all your verses printed fair, 
      Then let them well be dried; 
And Curll must have a special care 
      To leave the margin wide. 

   Lend these to paper-sparing Pope; 
      And when he sets to write, 
No letter with an envelope 
      Could give him more delight. 

   When Pope has fill'd the margins round, 
      Why then recall your loan; 
Sell them to Curll for fifty pound, 
      And swear they are your own.

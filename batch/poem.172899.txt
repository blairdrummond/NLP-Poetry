Allusion, Simile

How blest the land that counts among 
      Her sons so many good and wise, 
To execute great feats of tongue 
      When troubles rise. 

Behold them mounting every stump, 
      By speech our liberty to guard. 
Observe their courage--see them jump, 
      And come down hard! 

"Walk up, walk up!" each cries aloud, 
      "And learn from me what you must do 
To turn aside the thunder cloud, 
      The earthquake too. 

"Beware the wiles of yonder quack 
      Who stuffs the ears of all that pass. 
I--I alone can show that black 
      Is white as grass." 

They shout through all the day and break 
      The silence of the night as well. 
They'd make--I wish they'd go and make-- 
      Of Heaven a Hell. 

A advocates free silver, B 
      Free trade and C free banking laws. 
Free board, clothes, lodging would from me 
      Win warm applause. 

Lo, D lifts up his voice: "You see 
      The single tax on land would fall 
On all alike." More evenly 
      No tax at all. 

"With paper money," bellows E, 
      "We'll all be rich as lords." No doubt-- 
And richest of the lot will be 
      The chap without. 

As many "cures" as addle-wits 
      Who know not what the ailment is! 
Meanwhile the patient foams and spits 
      Like a gin fizz. 

Alas, poor Body Politic, 
      Your fate is all too clearly read: 
To be not altogether quick, 
      Nor very dead. 

You take your exercise in squirms, 
      Your rest in fainting fits between. 
'Tis plain that your disorder's worms-- 
      Worms fat and lean. 

Worm Capital, Worm Labor dwell 
      Within your maw and muscle's scope. 
Their quarrels make your life a Hell, 
      Your death a hope. 

God send you find not such an end 
      To ills however sharp and huge! 
God send you convalesce! God send 
      You vermifuge.

Je vois les effroyables espaces de l’Univers qui m’enferment, et je me trouve attaché à un coin de cette vaste étendue, sans savoir pourquoi je suis plutôt en ce lieu qu’en un autre, ni pourquoi ce peu de temps qui m’est donné à vivre m’est assigné à ce point plutôt qu'à un autre de toute l’éternité qui m’a précédé, et de toute qui me suit.  Pascal, Pensées sur la religion   The approach of a man’s life out of the past is history, and the approach of time out of the future is mystery. Their meeting is the present, and it is consciousness, the only time life is alive. The endless wonder of this meeting is what causes the mind, in its inward liberty of a frozen morning, to turn back and question and remember. The world is full of places. Why is it that I am here? Wendell Berry, The Long-Legged House
Spared by a car or airplane crash or 
cured of malignancy, people look 
around with new eyes at a newly 
praiseworthy world, blinking eyes like these.

For I’ve been brought back again from the 
fine silt, the mud where our atoms lie 
down for long naps. And I’ve also been 
pardoned miraculously for years
by the lava of chance which runs down 
the world’s gullies, silting us back.
Here I am, brought back, set up, not yet 
happened away.

                     But it’s not this random
life only, throwing its sensual 
astonishments upside down on
the bloody membranes behind my eyeballs,
not just me being here again, old 
needer, looking for someone to need, 
but you, up from the clay yourself, 
as luck would have it, and inching 
over the same little segment of earth-
ball, in the same little eon, to
meet in a room, alive in our skins, 
and the whole galaxy gaping there
and the centuries whining like gnats
you, to teach me to see it, to see
it with you, and to offer somebody 
uncomprehending, impudent thanks.

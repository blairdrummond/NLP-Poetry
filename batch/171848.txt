title : I Dreamed That I Was Old

author : Stanley Kunitz

text : 
I dreamed that I was old: in stale declension   
Fallen from my prime, when company 
Was mine, cat-nimbleness, and green invention,   
Before time took my leafy hours away. 

My wisdom, ripe with body’s ruin, found   
Itself tart recompense for what was lost 
In false exchange: since wisdom in the ground   
Has no apocalypse or pentecost. 

I wept for my youth, sweet passionate young thought, 
And cozy women dead that by my side   
Once lay: I wept with bitter longing, not   
Remembering how in my youth I cried.

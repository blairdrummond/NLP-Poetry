title : With Mercy for the Greedy

author : Anne Sexton

text : 
For my friend, Ruth, who urges me to make an appointment for the Sacrament of Confession
Concerning your letter in which you ask   
me to call a priest and in which you ask   
me to wear The Cross that you enclose;   
your own cross, 
your dog-bitten cross, 
no larger than a thumb, 
small and wooden, no thorns, this rose— 

I pray to its shadow, 
that gray place 
where it lies on your letter ... deep, deep. 
I detest my sins and I try to believe 
in The Cross. I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,   
its solid neck, its brown sleep. 

True. There is 
a beautiful Jesus. 
He is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef. 
How desperately he wanted to pull his arms in! 
How desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!   
But I can’t. Need is not quite belief. 

All morning long   
I have worn 
your cross, hung with package string around my throat.   
It tapped me lightly as a child’s heart might, 
tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.   
Ruth, I cherish the letter you wrote. 

My friend, my friend, I was born   
doing reference work in sin, and born   
confessing it. This is what poems are:   
with mercy 
for the greedy, 
they are the tongue’s wrangle, 
the world's pottage, the rat's star.

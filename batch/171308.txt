title : Through a Glass Eye, Lightly

author : Carolyn Kizer

text : 
In the laboratory waiting room 
containing 
one television actor with a teary face 
trying a contact lens; 
two muscular victims of industrial accidents;   
several vain women—I was one of them—   
came Deborah, four, to pick up her glass eye. 

It was a long day: 
Deborah waiting for the blood vessels 
painted 
on her iris to dry. 
Her mother said that, holding Deborah 
when she was born, 
“First I inspected her, from toes to navel, 
then stopped at her head ...” 
We wondered why 
the inspection hadn’t gone the other way.   
“Looking into her eye 
was like looking into a volcano: 

“Her vacant pupil 
went whirling down, down to the foundation   
of the world ... 
When she was three months old they took it out.   
She giggled when she went under 
the anaesthetic. 
Forty-five minutes later she came back 
happy! ... 
The gas wore off, she found the hole in her face 
(you know, it never bled?), 
stayed happy, even when I went to pieces.   
She’s five, in June. 

“Deborah, you get right down 
from there, or I’ll have to slap!” 
Laughing, Deborah climbed into the lap 
of one vain lady, who 
had been discontented with her own beauty.   
Now she held on to Deborah, looked her steadily   
in the empty eye.

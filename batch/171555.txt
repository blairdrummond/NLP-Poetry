title : The Militance of a Photograph in the Passbook of a Bantu under Detention

Peace is the active presence of Justice.
The wrinkles on the brown face   
of the carrying case 
conform to the buttocks, 
on which the streaks of water   
from a five-gallon can 
dribble on the tailfront 
of the borrowed shirt 
he would wear if he could 
drain the pus from his swaddling   
bandages, striations of skin 
tunneling into the photograph. 

This is no simple mug shot 
of a runaway boy in a training   
film, Soweto's pummeled wire,   
though the turrets of light   
glisten in smoke, the soft   
coal hooding his platform   
entrance, dull and quiet. 

His father's miner's shoes   
stand in puddles of polish,   
the black soot baked 
into images of brittle torso,   
an inferno of bullets laid   
out in a letter bomb, 
the frontispiece of one sergeant- 
major blackening his mustache. 

On the drive to Evaton 
a blank pass away from Sharpeville   
where the freehold morgans 
were bought by a black bishop 
from Ontario, Canada, on a trek 
northward from the Cape in 1908, 
I speak to myself as the woman 
riding in the backseat talks 
of this day, her husband's 
death, twenty-three years ago, 
run over by an Afrikaner in the wrong   
passing lane; the passbook on the shoulder   
of the road leading to Evaton 
is not the one I have in my hand, 
and the photograph is not of my great- 
grandfather, who set sail for Philadelphia   
in the war year of 1916. 
He did not want a reception, his letters   
embarking on a platform at Queenstown   
where his eloquence struck two Zulu warriors   
pledged to die in the homelands 
because they could not spin their own gold. 

These threaded heads weigh down the ears   
in design of the warrior, Shaka, 
indifferent to the ruthless offerings 
over the dead bodies of his wives, 
childless in the campaigns with the British,   
who sit on the ships of the Indian Ocean   
each kraal shuddering near the borders; 

her lips turn in profile 
to the dust rising over a road   
where his house once stood;   
one could think of the women   
carrying firewood as an etching   
in remembrance to the silence,   
commencing at Sharpeville, 
but this is Evaton, where he would come 
from across the galleyship of spears   
turning in his robes to a bookmark; 
it is a good book, the picture of words   
in the gloss of a photograph, 
the burned image of the man who wears   
this image on the tongue of a child,   
who might hold my hand 
as we walk in late afternoon 
into the predestined sun. 

The press of wrinkles on the blanketed   
voice of the man who took the train   
from Johannesburg 
is flattened in Cape Town,   
and the history of this book   
is on a trestle where Gandhi   
worshipped in Natal, 
and the Zulu lullaby 
I cannot sing in Bantu 
is this song in the body   
of a passbook 
and the book passes 
into a shirt 
and the back that wears it.

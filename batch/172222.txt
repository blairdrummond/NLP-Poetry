title : It Is There

These are the streets where we walked with war and childhood 
Like our two shadows behind us, or 
Before us like one shadow. 
                                       River walks 
Threaded by park rats, flanked by battleships, 
Flickering of a grey tail on the bank, 
Motionless hulls 
Enormous under a dead grey sky. 
Farther, the harbor and the miscolored waters 
Rocking their flotsam under the blank round eye 
At the masthead staring down the rats to come, 
Beyond the fisher gulls. 
And the windows full of ropes and hardware, 
Doorways, barreled, yawning on the dark, 
Wall-eyed alleys, coils of husky smells, 
The breath of journeys strong there. 
Streets whose sordid beauty 
                                        joked readily with hope. 
The taller avenues, 
And walls that smiled like unpurchased horizons, 
Swung intimate views out of a foreign room, 
Hung a gate upon a garden's fable, 
Walls that frowned 
With aged remorseless eyes 
Or the gloom of thunderlit landscapes, opening 
A door into that placeless country 
Where the sad animal is blithe, free and at home. 
Too, those halls 
Where we stepped lightly among the creatures 
Whom death had tamed, who yet crouched, sprang, or flew, 
Fierce as hunger, graceful as joy, 
Until we knew, as in a half silvered mirror, the half 
Captive image of immortality. 
These are the old places, and walking there 
As then with war and childhood, I look into the shadows' faces. 
They appal. 
                Yet often I will see 
(The marvels floating alive upon that stream, 
The breathing of delight like purest air) 
Another place: that you contrived 
Between midnight and morning 
In your dream, and in the morning 
Took me there. 
                     We greeted it, who could not stay. 
But it is there, 
Surviving disbelief, surviving even what the malign years prepare.

title : An Epiphany

I have seen the Brown Recluse Spider   
run with a net in her hand, or rather,   
what resembled a net, what resembled 
a hand. She ran down the gleaming white floor   
of the bathtub, trailing a frail swirl   
of hair, and in it the hull of a beetle   
lay woven. The hair was my wife’s,   
long and dark, a few loose strands, a curl   
she might idly have turned on a finger,   
she might idly have twisted, speaking to me,   
and the legs of the beetle were broken.

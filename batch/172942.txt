title : Song: My silks and fine array

author : William Blake

text : 
My silks and fine array, 
         My smiles and languish'd air, 
By love are driv'n away; 
         And mournful lean Despair 
Brings me yew to deck my grave: 
Such end true lovers have. 

His face is fair as heav'n, 
         When springing buds unfold; 
O why to him was't giv'n, 
         Whose heart is wintry cold? 
His breast is love's all worship'd tomb, 
Where all love's pilgrims come. 

Bring me an axe and spade, 
         Bring me a winding sheet; 
When I my grave have made, 
         Let winds and tempests beat: 
Then down I'll lie, as cold as clay. 
True love doth pass away!

title : To My Wife

author : J. V. Cunningham

text : 
And does the heart grow old? You know   
In the indiscriminate green 
Of summer or in earliest snow 
A landscape is another scene, 

Inchoate and anonymous, 
And every rock and bush and drift   
As our affections alter us 
Will alter with the season’s shift. 

So love by love we come at last, 
As through the exclusions of a rhyme,   
Or the exactions of a past, 
To the simplicity of time, 

The antiquity of grace, where yet   
We live in terror and delight   
With love as quiet as regret   
And love like anger in the night.

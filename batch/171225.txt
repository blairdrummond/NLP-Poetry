title : In Dreams

author : Kim Addonizio

text : 
After eighteen years there’s no real grief left   
for the man who was my father. 
I hardly think of him anymore, 
and those dreams I used to have, 

in which he’d be standing in a room of people   
I didn’t know—maybe his new friends,   
if the dead have friendships— 
those dreams no longer trouble my sleep. 

He’s not in the crooked houses I wander through   
or in the field by the highway 
where I’m running, chasing down 
some important piece of paper, 

desperate to reach it 
as it’s lifted in the wake of trucks 
or flattened and marked by passing cars,   
as it’s lifted again to swirl over 

a broken wood fence. I don’t know why   
the paper’s so important, or if anything 
is even written there. 
I don’t know where the dead go, 

or why it’s good to forget them, 
not to see them if they come crowding 
the windows or trying to lay themselves down   
and press along our bodies at night 

and ask that we love them again, 
that our sorrows include them once more.   
This morning I couldn’t get up. 
I slept late, I dreamed of the single 

sheet of paper, which I never managed to reach   
as it stuttered and soared over the grass 
and a few flowers, so that I woke 
with a sense of loss, wondering who 

or what I had to mourn besides 
my father, whom I no longer mourn,   
father buried in the earth beneath grass,   
beneath flowers I trample as I run.

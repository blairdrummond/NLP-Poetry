title : Clan Meeting:  Births and Nations:  A Blood Song

author : Michael S. Harper

We reconstruct lives in the intensive   
care unit, pieced together in a buffet   
dinner: two widows with cancerous breasts   
in their balled hands; a 30-year-old man   
in a three-month coma 
from a Buick and a brick wall; 
a woman who bleeds off and on from her gullet; 
a prominent socialite, our own nurse,   
shrieking for twins, “her bump gone”;   
the gallery of veterans, succored, 
awake, without valves, some lungs gone. 

Splicing the meats with fluids 
seasoned on the dressing room 
table, she sings “the bump gone” 
refrain in this 69-degree oven, 
unstuffing her twin yolks 
carved from the breast, the dark meat   
wrapped in tinfoil and clean newspaper; 
the half black registered nurse   
hums her six years in an orphanage,   
her adopted white family, 
breaded and primed in a posse, 
rising in clan for their dinner. 

We reload our brains as the cameras,   
the film overexposed 
in the x-ray light, 
locked with our double door 
light meters: race and sex 
spooled and rungs in a hobby; 
we take our bundle and go home.

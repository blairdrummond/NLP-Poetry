title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 3

author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson

text : 
O Sorrow, cruel fellowship, 
         O Priestess in the vaults of Death, 
         O sweet and bitter in a breath, 
What whispers from thy lying lip? 

"The stars," she whispers, "blindly run; 
         A web is wov'n across the sky; 
         From out waste places comes a cry, 
And murmurs from the dying sun: 

"And all the phantom, Nature, standsi 
         With all the music in her tone, 
         A hollow echo of my own,i 
A hollow form with empty hands." 

And shall I take a thing so blind, 
         Embrace her as my natural good; 
         Or crush her, like a vice of blood, 
Upon the threshold of the mind?

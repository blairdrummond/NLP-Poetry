title : The White Porch

text : 
I wrap the blue towel   
after washing, 
around the damp   
weight of hair, bulky   
as a sleeping cat, 
and sit out on the porch.   
Still dripping water,   
it’ll be dry by supper,   
by the time the dust   
settles off your shoes,   
though it’s only five   
past noon. Think 
of the luxury: how to use   
the afternoon like the stretch 
of lawn spread before me.   
There’s the laundry,   
sun-warm clothes at twilight,   
and the mountain of beans 
in my lap. Each one,   
I’ll break and snap   
thoughtfully in half. 

But there is this slow arousal.   
The small buttons   
of my cotton blouse 
are pulling away from my body.   
I feel the strain of threads, 
the swollen magnolias   
heavy as a flock of birds   
in the tree. Already,   
the orange sponge cake   
is rising in the oven. 
I know you’ll say it makes   
your mouth dry 
and I’ll watch you 
drench your slice of it   
in canned peaches 
and lick the plate clean. 

So much hair, my mother   
used to say, grabbing   
the thick braided rope 
in her hands while we washed   
the breakfast dishes, discussing 
dresses and pastries. 
My mind often elsewhere 
as we did the morning chores together.   
Sometimes, a few strands   
would catch in her gold ring.   
I worked hard then, 
anticipating the hour 
when I would let the rope down 
at night, strips of sheets,   
knotted and tied, 
while she slept in tight blankets. 
My hair, freshly washed   
like a measure of wealth,   
like a bridal veil. 
Crouching in the grass, 
you would wait for the signal,   
for the movement of curtains   
before releasing yourself   
from the shadow of moths.   
Cloth, hair and hands,   
smuggling you in.

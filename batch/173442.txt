author : John Dryden

COMUS
Your hay it is mow'd, and your corn is reap'd;
Your barns will be full, and your hovels heap'd:
         Come, my boys, come;
         Come, my boys, come;
And merrily roar out Harvest Home.

CHORUS
Come, my boys, come;
Come, my boys, come;
And merrily roar out Harvest Home.

MAN
   We ha' cheated the parson, we'll cheat him agen,
For why should a blockhead ha' one in ten?
      One in ten,
      One in ten,
For why should a blockhead ha' one in ten?

   For prating so long like a book-learn'd sot,
Till pudding and dumplin burn to pot,
      Burn to pot,
      Burn to pot,
Till pudding and dumplin burn to pot.

CHORUS
Burn to pot,
Burn to pot,
Till pudding and dumplin burn to pot.
   We'll toss off our ale till we canno' stand,
And Hoigh for the honour of Old England:
      Old England,
      Old England,
And Hoigh for the honour of Old England.

CHORUS
Old England,
Old England,
And Hoigh for the honour of Old England.

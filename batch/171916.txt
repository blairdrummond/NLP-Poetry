title : Fermanagh Cave

An emerald dungeon’s blacklight glow   
glimmered in the deeper reaches 
where my son and I could hear the slub   
of water riddling through the muck. 

We’d stumbled on it following a stream,   
his first cave made stranger still 
by a chill that closes on the goblined heart   
of a boy inflamed by stories where 

gnome-clans hoarded underground   
bone-shard, mandrake, monkey gland,   
and eel. And so, grave Hansel 
paying out his last scraps of bread, 

he inched inward looking back 
and gathering himself as he devolved   
step by step along the wet-ribbed walls,   
the omphalos seepage of a subterranea 

that dreamed us into its kingdom come,   
where like some secret dreams 
make known the burnt-punk smell   
of marijuana cluttered up the air, 

and just beyond, just close enough to see,   
a spur of light that like a dwindling   
eyemote disappeared. Then the sound   
a human soul makes as it slips out 

from the throat. Composed in darkness,   
my son’s hand closed on mine. I bent   
to whisper we could turn back now, 
but his voice was there before me saying, 

“Something’s here.” And something was,   
something that in that instant rose, 
and moved off from us, or drew up close.   
In either case, my son came to me 

almost weightlessly at first, then hungry   
for what was filling up my arms, 
the startled, upriding bodyweight   
of a boy I’d never before felt rock 

so solidly into the place I was, 
blind and hunkered in the earthen air.   
I held him only a moment there. 
We didn’t speak. And though the wheeze 

of his breathing must’ve stopped my ears,   
for weeks to come, settling him back   
to sleep at night, or waking him 
from some troubling dream, I’d hear 

the soft concussion of an outsized heart- 
beat I could not decide was mine, 
or his, or the stranger’s I had brought us to.   
Or if what happened would happen again, 

years from now, when he is grown, 
and I have grown newly strange to him.

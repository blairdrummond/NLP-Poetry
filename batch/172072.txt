title : The Woman Who Laughed on Calvary

I. 

Smilers, smirkers, chucklers, grinners,   
platitudinizers, euphemists: it wasn't you 

I emulated there, in that   
Godawful place. What kind   
of face 

to put on it? How simple 
is a simon's sign? To my mind 
laughter's not the mark of pleasure, not   
a pleasantry that spread; instead 

it's intimate with sheer 
delirium: spilt brain 
on split lip, uncontainable 
interiority— 
(make no mistake, it is a horror, this 

inmated, intimated   
self, revealed as your   
material: red smear, 
white swipe). It's said the brain 
stinks first, then organworks of art and eatery, 
and then—what's left? a little cartilage for 

ambiguity? a little tendon's B&D? At last, the least   
ephemeral of evidences: nuggetworks (discrete, and   
indiscreet) of teeth, bone-bits, odd scraps 
of a delapidated strut—and this is just 
the sort of stuff, insensate, 
to which life (which comes again 

as slime) has always 
loved adhering. Life! Who wouldn't   
laugh? Your inner life! Your pet   
pretense! It can't be kept up, can't   
be kept clean, 
even in a thought, 
except a good 
bloodworks or shitpump keeps it so. 

   II. 

Out of the mouth comes a tongue, 
it calls itself linguistic and it 
never quite effects 
the cover-up (good 
Lord, there's much to 
cover up: so many belches, outcries, 
upchucks, sneezes, puffings, hiccups, osculations, hawks and   
   coughs)— 

so laughter (which, among the noises, prides itself   
on being the most intellectual) can't help   
but come out, snorting. Nothing 

smiled or mild or meanwhiling—a laugh's 
got teeth to send it off, 
and spit to keep it company, and rot 
to end up with. Its closest kin is grimace, it's 
a grimacing with wind.   
It will (the will 
be damned) 
burst out 

in bad cacaphonies of 
brouhaha and borborygma—it's the   
stockbroker of mockeries, a trachea rake— 
the vent of rage and irony, and right   
there in the very 
shrine of signs. A laugh, I mean, 
is sorrow's 

archery and signature,   
while flesh is being   
hoisted and arrayed 

on roosts of skeleton. 

   III. 

I saw what good 

comes to; I saw the figure 
human being cuts, upon its frame.   
The laugh was a cry from my own 

perscrewed, misnailed, cross-crafted   
armature. Despite 

your consternations, oh you 
meekened warners and polite   
conventioneers, the thieves were better   
served upon that day. For the heart 

is a muscle, where cruelty's humored.   
The tooth of moral rectitude's   
a fang. What I gave 

at the sight of him there 

was up. What I got   
of humanity there   
was the hang . . .

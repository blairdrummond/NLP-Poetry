title : Faustine

author : Algernon Charles Swinburne

text : 
Ave Faustina Imperatrix, morituri te salutant.
Lean back, and get some minutes' peace; 
      Let your head lean 
Back to the shoulder with its fleece 
      Of locks, Faustine. 

The shapely silver shoulder stoops, 
      Weighed over clean 
With state of splendid hair that droops 
      Each side, Faustine. 

Let me go over your good gifts 
      That crown you queen; 
A queen whose kingdom ebbs and shifts 
      Each week, Faustine. 

Bright heavy brows well gathered up: 
      White gloss and sheen; 
Carved lips that make my lips a cup 
      To drink, Faustine, 

Wine and rank poison, milk and blood, 
      Being mixed therein 
Since first the devil threw dice with God 
      For you, Faustine. 

Your naked new-born soul, their stake, 
      Stood blind between; 
God said "let him that wins her take 
      And keep Faustine." 

But this time Satan throve, no doubt; 
      Long since, I ween, 
God's part in you was battered out; 
      Long since, Faustine. 

The die rang sideways as it fell, 
      Rang cracked and thin, 
Like a man's laughter heard in hell 
      Far down, Faustine, 

A shadow of laughter like a sigh, 
      Dead sorrow's kin; 
So rang, thrown down, the devil's die 
      That won Faustine. 

A suckling of his breed you were, 
      One hard to wean; 
But God, who lost you, left you fair, 
      We see, Faustine. 

You have the face that suits a woman 
      For her soul's screen — 
The sort of beauty that's called human 
      In hell, Faustine. 

You could do all things but be good 
      Or chaste of mien; 
And that you would not if you could, 
      We know, Faustine. 

Even he who cast seven devils out 
      Of Magdalene 
Could hardly do as much, I doubt, 
      For you, Faustine. 

Did Satan make you to spite God? 
      Or did God mean 
To scourge with scorpions for a rod 
      Our sins, Faustine? 

I know what queen at first you were, 
      As though I had seen 
Red gold and black imperious hair 
      Twice crown Faustine. 

As if your fed sarcophagus 
      Spared flesh and skin, 
You come back face to face with us, 
      The same Faustine. 

She loved the games men played with death, 
      Where death must win; 
As though the slain man's blood and breath 
      Revived Faustine. 

Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net; 
      Lithe limbs and lean 
From drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat 
      To soothe Faustine. 

She drank the steaming drift and dust 
      Blown off the scene; 
Blood could not ease the bitter lust 
      That galled Faustine. 

All round the foul fat furrows reeked, 
      Where blood sank in; 
The circus splashed and seethed and shrieked 
      All round Faustine. 

But these are gone now: years entomb 
      The dust and din; 
Yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume 
      That slew Faustine. 

Was life worth living then? and now 
      Is life worth sin? 
Where are the imperial years? and how 
      Are you Faustine? 

Your soul forgot her joys, forgot 
      Her times of teen; 
Yea, this life likewise will you not 
      Forget, Faustine? 

For in the time we know not of 
      Did fate begin 
Weaving the web of days that wove 
      Your doom, Faustine. 

The threads were wet with wine, and all 
      Were smooth to spin; 
They wove you like a Bacchanal, 
      The first Faustine. 

And Bacchus cast your mates and you 
      Wild grapes to glean; 
Your flower-like lips were dashed with dew 
      From his, Faustine. 

Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold 
      The vine's wet green, 
Long ere they coined in Roman gold 
      Your face, Faustine. 

Then after change of soaring feather 
      And winnowing fin, 
You woke in weeks of feverish weather, 
      A new Faustine. 

A star upon your birthday burned, 
      Whose fierce serene 
Red pulseless planet never yearned 
      In heaven, Faustine. 

Stray breaths of Sapphic song that blew 
      Through Mitylene 
Shook the fierce quivering blood in you 
      By night, Faustine. 

The shameless nameless love that makes 
      Hell's iron gin 
Shut on you like a trap that breaks 
      The soul, Faustine. 

And when your veins were void and dead, 
      What ghosts unclean 
Swarmed round the straitened barren bed 
      That hid Faustine? 

What sterile growths of sexless root 
      Or epicene? 
What flower of kisses without fruit 
      Of love, Faustine? 

What adders came to shed their coats? 
      What coiled obscene 
Small serpents with soft stretching throats 
      Caressed Faustine? 

But the time came of famished hours, 
      Maimed loves and mean, 
This ghastly thin-faced time of ours, 
      To spoil Faustine. 

You seem a thing that hinges hold, 
      A love-machine 
With clockwork joints of supple gold — 
      No more, Faustine. 

Not godless, for you serve one God, 
      The Lampsacene, 
Who metes the gardens with his rod; 
      Your lord, Faustine. 

If one should love you with real love 
      (Such things have been, 
Things your fair face knows nothing of, 
      It seems, Faustine); 

That clear hair heavily bound back, 
      The lights wherein 
Shift from dead blue to burnt-up black; 
      Your throat, Faustine, 

Strong, heavy, throwing out the face 
      And hard bright chin 
And shameful scornful lips that grace 
      Their shame, Faustine, 

Curled lips, long since half kissed away, 
      Still sweet and keen; 
You'd give him — poison shall we say? 
      Or what, Faustine?

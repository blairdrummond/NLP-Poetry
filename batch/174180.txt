title : Envoi

author : Ezra Pound

text : 
Go, dumb-born book, 
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes: 
Hadst thou but song 
As thou hast subjects known, 
Then were there cause in thee that should condone 
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie 
And build her glories their longevity. 

Tell her that sheds 
Such treasure in the air, 
Recking naught else but that her graces give 
Life to the moment, 
I would bid them live 
As roses might, in magic amber laid, 
Red overwrought with orange and all made 
One substance and one colour 
Braving time. 

Tell her that goes 
With song upon her lips 
But sings not out the song, nor knows 
The maker of it, some other mouth, 
May be as fair as hers, 
Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers, 
When our two dusts with Wallerâ€™s shall be laid, 
Siftings on siftings in oblivion, 
Till change hath broken down 
All things save Beauty alone.

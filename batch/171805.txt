text : 
In the still morning when you move   
toward me in sleep for love,   
I dream of 

an island where long-stemmed cranes,   
serious weather vanes,   
turn slowly on one 

foot. There the dragonfly folds   
his mica wings and rides   
the tall reed 

close as a handle. The hippo yawns,   
nods to thick pythons, 
slack and drowsy, who droop down 

like untied sashes 
from the trees. The brash   
hyenas do not cackle 

and run but lie with their paws   
on their heads like dogs.   
The lazy crow’s caw 

falls like a sigh. In the field   
below, the fat moles build   
their dull passage with an old 

instinct that needs 
no light or waking; its slow beat   
turns the hand in sleep 

as we turn toward each other   
in the ripe air of summer,   
before the change of weather, 

before the heavy drop   
of the apples.

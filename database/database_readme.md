I'm really new at databases, but this is an attempt to automatically generate code to get a database running. Automatically extracting meta-data from the poems in the corpus (And adding our new statistics/features as they are developed).

The System is being written for a postgresql standard, and it is being tested in pgadmin 3.


NOTE: At the moment, many poet names are not being extracted correctly.

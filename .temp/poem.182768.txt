Two shall be born the whole world wide apart, 
And speak in different tongues, and pay their debts 
In different kinds of coin; and give no heed 
Each to the other's being. And know not 
That each might suit the other to a T, 
If they were but correctly introduced. 
And these, unconsciously, shall bend their steps, 
Escaping Spaniards and defying war, 
Unerringly toward the same trysting-place, 
Albeit they know it not. Until at last 
They enter the same door, and suddenly 
They meet. And ere they've seen each other's face 
They fall into each other's arms, upon 
The Broadway cable car - and this is Fate!

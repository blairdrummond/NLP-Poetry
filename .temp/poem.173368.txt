This is my play's last scene; here heavens appoint 
My pilgrimage's last mile; and my race, 
Idly, yet quickly run, hath this last pace, 
My span's last inch, my minute's latest point; 
And gluttonous death will instantly unjoint 
My body and my soul, and I shall sleep a space; 
But my'ever-waking part shall see that face 
Whose fear already shakes my every joint. 
Then, as my soul to'heaven, her first seat, takes flight, 
And earth-born body in the earth shall dwell, 
So fall my sins, that all may have their right, 
To where they'are bred, and would press me, to hell. 
Impute me righteous, thus purg'd of evil, 
For thus I leave the world, the flesh, the devil.

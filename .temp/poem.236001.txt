High-hearted Surrey! I do love your ways, 
Venturous, frank, romantic, vehement, 
All with inviolate honor sealed and blent, 
To the axe-edge that cleft your soldier-bays: 
I love your youth, your friendships, whims, and frays; 
Your strict, sweet verse, with its imperious bent, 
Heard as in dreams from some old harper's tent, 
And stirring in the listener's brain for days. 
Good father-poet! if to-night there be 
At Framlingham none save the north-wind's sighs, 
No guard but moonlight's crossed and trailing spears, 
Smile yet upon the pilgrim named like me, 
Close at your gates, whose fond and weary eyes 
Sought not one other down three hundred years!

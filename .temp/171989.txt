 
Pawnbroker, scavenger, cheapskate, 
come creeping from your pigeon-filled backrooms, 
past guns and clocks and locks and cages, 
past pockets emptied and coins picked from the floor; 
come sweeping with the rainclouds down the river 
through the brokenblack windows of factories 
to avenues where movies whisk through basement projectors 
and children peel up into the supplejack twilight-- 
there a black-eyed straight-backed drag queen 
preens, fusses, fixes her hair in a shop window on Prince, 
a young businessman jingles his change 
and does his Travis Bickle for a long-faced friend, 
there on the corner I laughed at a joke Jim made. 
In the bedroom the moon is a dented spoon, 
cold, getting colder, so hurry sleep, 
come creep into bed, let's get it over with; 
lay me down and close my eyes 
and tell me whip, tell me winnow 
tell me sweet tell me skittish 
tell me No tell me no such thing 
tell me straw into gold tell me crept into fire 
tell me lost all my money tell me hoarded, verboten, 
but promise tomorrow I will be profligate, 
stepping into the sun like a trophy.

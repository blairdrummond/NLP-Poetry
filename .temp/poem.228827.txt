Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea; 
         The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape, 
         With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape; 
But O too fond, when have I answer'd thee? 
                Ask me no more. 

Ask me no more: what answer should I give? 
         I love not hollow cheek or faded eye: 
         Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die! 
Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live; 
                Ask me no more. 

Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal'd: 
         I strove against the stream and all in vain: 
         Let the great river take me to the main: 
No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield; 
                Ask me no more.

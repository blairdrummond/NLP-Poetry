 
I killed a fly 
and laid my weapon next to it 
as one lays the weapon of a dead hero   
beside his body--the fly 
that tried to mount the window 
to its top; that was born out of a swamp   
to die in a bold effort beyond itself, 
and I am the one who brought it to an end.   
Tired of the day and with night coming on   
I lay my body down beside the fly.

Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda.  - Dante Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.  - Petrarca 
I loved you first: but afterwards your love
    Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
    Which owes the other most? my love was long,
    And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
And loved me for what might or might not be -
    Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not 'mine' or 'thine;'
    With separate 'I' and 'thou' free love has done,
         For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of 'thine that is not mine;'
         Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.

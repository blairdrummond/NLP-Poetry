 
--Was it for this 
That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov'd 
To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's song, 
And from his alder shades and rocky falls, 
And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice 
That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou, 
O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains 
Near my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream 
Make ceaseless music through the night and day 
Which with its steady cadence, tempering 
Our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts 
To more than infant softness, giving me, 
Among the fretful dwellings of mankind, 
A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm 
That Nature breathes among the hills and groves. 
When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers 
Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came, 
Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close by, 
Along the margin of our Terrace Walk. 
He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd. 
Oh! many a time have I, a five years' Child, 
A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill, 
A little Mill-race sever'd from his stream, 
Made one long bathing of a summer's day, 
Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again 
Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd 
Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves 
Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill, 
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height, 
Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone 
Beneath the sky, as if I had been born 
On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut 
Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport, 
A naked Savage, in the thunder shower. 

       Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up 
Foster'd alike by beauty and by fear; 
Much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less 
In that beloved Vale to which, erelong, 
I was transplanted. Well I call to mind 
('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen 
Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope 
The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd 
The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy 
To wander half the night among the Cliffs 
And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran 
Along the open turf. In thought and wish 
That time, my shoulder all with springes hung, 
I was a fell destroyer. On the heights 
Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied 
My anxious visitation, hurrying on, 
Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars 
Were shining o'er my head; I was alone, 
And seem'd to be a trouble to the peace 
That was among them. Sometimes it befel 
In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire 
O'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird 
Which was the captive of another's toils 
Became my prey; and, when the deed was done 
I heard among the solitary hills 
Low breathings coming after me, and sounds 
Of undistinguishable motion, steps 
Almost as silent as the turf they trod. 
Nor less in springtime when on southern banks 
The shining sun had from his knot of leaves 
Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales 
And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then 
In the high places, on the lonesome peaks 
Where'er, among the mountains and the winds, 
The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean 
My object, and inglorious, yet the end 
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung 
Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass 
And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock 
But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd, 
Suspended by the blast which blew amain, 
Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time, 
While on the perilous ridge I hung alone, 
With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind 
Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky 
Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds! 

       The mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath 
And harmony of music. There is a dark 
Invisible workmanship that reconciles 
Discordant elements, and makes them move 
In one society. Ah me! that all 
The terrors, all the early miseries 
Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all 
The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd 
Into my mind, should ever have made up 
The calm existence that is mine when I 
Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end! 
Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe 
That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame 
A favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn 
Of infancy doth open out the clouds, 
As at the touch of lightning, seeking him 
With gentlest visitation; not the less, 
Though haply aiming at the self-same end, 
Does it delight her sometimes to employ 
Severer interventions, ministry 
More palpable, and so she dealt with me. 

       One evening (surely I was led by her) 
I went alone into a Shepherd's Boat, 
A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied 
Within a rocky Cave, its usual home. 
'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale 
Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come 
A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays. 
Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone 
No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff, 
Discover'd thus by unexpected chance, 
Than I unloos'd her tether and embark'd. 
The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear 
Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore 
I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again 
In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on 
Even like a Man who walks with stately step 
Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth 
And troubled pleasure; not without the voice 
Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on, 
Leaving behind her still on either side 
Small circles glittering idly in the moon, 
Until they melted all into one track 
Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose 
Above the Cavern of the Willow tree 
And now, as suited one who proudly row'd 
With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view 
Upon the top of that same craggy ridge, 
The bound of the horizon, for behind 
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. 
She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily 
I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake, 
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat 
Went heaving through the water, like a Swan; 
When from behind that craggy Steep, till then 
The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff, 
As if with voluntary power instinct, 
Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again 
And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff 
Rose up between me and the stars, and still, 
With measur'd motion, like a living thing, 
Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd, 
And through the silent water stole my way 
Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree. 
There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark, 
And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave 
And serious thoughts; and after I had seen 
That spectacle, for many days, my brain 
Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense 
Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts 
There was a darkness, call it solitude, 
Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes 
Of hourly objects, images of trees, 
Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields; 
But huge and mighty Forms that do not live 
Like living men mov'd slowly through the mind 
By day and were the trouble of my dreams. 

       Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! 
Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought! 
That giv'st to forms and images a breath 
And everlasting motion! not in vain, 
By day or star-light thus from my first dawn 
Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me 
The passions that build up our human Soul, 
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man, 
But with high objects, with enduring things, 
With life and nature, purifying thus 
The elements of feeling and of thought, 
And sanctifying, by such discipline, 
Both pain and fear, until we recognize 
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. 

       Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me 
With stinted kindness. In November days, 
When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made 
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods 
At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights, 
When, by the margin of the trembling Lake, 
Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went 
In solitude, such intercourse was mine; 
'Twas mine among the fields both day and night, 
And by the waters all the summer long. 

       And in the frosty season, when the sun 
Was set, and visible for many a mile 
The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd, 
I heeded not the summons:--happy time 
It was, indeed, for all of us; to me 
It was a time of rapture: clear and loud 
The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about, 
Proud and exulting, like an untired horse, 
That cares not for its home.--All shod with steel, 
We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games 
Confederate, imitative of the chace 
And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, 
The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. 
So through the darkness and the cold we flew, 
And not a voice was idle; with the din, 
Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud, 
The leafless trees, and every icy crag 
Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills 
Into the tumult sent an alien sound 
Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars, 
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west 
The orange sky of evening died away. 

       Not seldom from the uproar I retired 
Into a silent bay, or sportively 
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, 
To cut across the image of a star 
That gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes 
When we had given our bodies to the wind, 
And all the shadowy banks, on either side, 
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still 
The rapid line of motion; then at once 
Have I, reclining back upon my heels, 
Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs 
Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd 
With visible motion her diurnal round; 
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train 
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd 
Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep. 

       Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky 
And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills! 
And Souls of lonely places! can I think 
A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd 
Such ministry, when Ye through many a year 
Haunting me thus among my boyish sports, 
On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, 
Impress'd upon all forms the characters 
Of danger or desire, and thus did make 
The surface of the universal earth 
With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, 
Work like a sea? 

                                          Not uselessly employ'd, 
I might pursue this theme through every change 
Of exercise and play, to which the year 
Did summon us in its delightful round. 

       We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven 
Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, 
Nor saw a race in happiness and joy 
More worthy of the ground where they were sown. 
I would record with no reluctant voice 
The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers 
With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line, 
True symbol of the foolishness of hope, 
Which with its strong enchantment led us on 
By rocks and pools, shut out from every star 
All the green summer, to forlorn cascades 
Among the windings of the mountain brooks. 
--Unfading recollections! at this hour 
The heart is almost mine with which I felt 
From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons 
The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds 
Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser, 
Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days, 
Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly 
Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm. 

       Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt, 
A ministration of your own was yours, 
A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love! 
Can I forget you, being as ye were 
So beautiful among the pleasant fields 
In which ye stood? Or can I here forget 
The plain and seemly countenance with which 
Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye 
Delights and exultations of your own. 
Eager and never weary we pursued 
Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire 
At evening; when with pencil and with slate, 
In square divisions parcell'd out, and all 
With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er, 
We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head 
In strife too humble to be named in Verse. 
Or round the naked table, snow-white deal, 
Cherry or maple, sate in close array, 
And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on 
thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world 
Neglected and ungratefully thrown by 
Even for the very service they had wrought, 
But husbanded through many a long campaign. 
Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few 
Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards, 
Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth 
Had glorified, and call'd to represent 
The persons of departed Potentates. 
Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell! 
Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, 
A congregation piteously akin. 
Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit, 
Those sooty knaves, precipitated down 
With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven, 
The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse, 
Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay, 
And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd 
By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad 
The heavy rain was falling, or the frost 
Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth, 
And, interrupting oft the impassion'd game, 
From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice, 
While it sank down towards the water, sent, 
Among the meadows and the hills, its long 
And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves 
When they are howling round the Bothnic Main. 

       Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace 
How Nature by extrinsic passion first 
Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand, 
And made me love them, may I well forget 
How other pleasures have been mine, and joys 
Of subtler origin; how I have felt, 
Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, 
Those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense 
Which seem, in their simplicity, to own 
An intellectual charm, that calm delight 
Which, if I err not, surely must belong 
To those first-born affinities that fit 
Our new existence to existing things, 
And, in our dawn of being, constitute 
The bond of union betwixt life and joy. 

       Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth, 
And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd 
The faces of the moving year, even then, 
A Child, I held unconscious intercourse 
With the eternal Beauty, drinking in 
A pure organic pleasure from the lines 
Of curling mist, or from the level plain 
Of waters colour'd by the steady clouds. 

       The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays 
Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell 
How when the Sea threw off his evening shade 
And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags 
Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, 
How I have stood, to fancies such as these, 
Engrafted in the tenderness of thought, 
A stranger, linking with the spectacle 
No conscious memory of a kindred sight, 
And bringing with me no peculiar sense 
Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood, 
Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues 
Of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd, 
Through every hair-breadth of that field of light, 
New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers. 

       Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy 
Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits 
Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss 
Which, like a tempest, works along the blood 
And is forgotten; even then I felt 
Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth 
And common face of Nature spake to me 
Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true, 
By chance collisions and quaint accidents 
Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd 
Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain 
Nor profitless, if haply they impress'd 
Collateral objects and appearances, 
Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep 
Until maturer seasons call'd them forth 
To impregnate and to elevate the mind. 
--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight 
Wearied itself out of the memory, 
The scenes which were a witness of that joy 
Remained, in their substantial lineaments 
Depicted on the brain, and to the eye 
Were visible, a daily sight; and thus 
By the impressive discipline of fear, 
By pleasure and repeated happiness, 
So frequently repeated, and by force 
Of obscure feelings representative 
Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, 
So beauteous and majestic in themselves, 
Though yet the day was distant, did at length 
Become habitually dear, and all 
Their hues and forms were by invisible links 
Allied to the affections. 

                                                       I began 
My story early, feeling as I fear, 
The weakness of a human love, for days 
Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring 
Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. 
Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt 
In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out, 
With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. 
Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch 
Invigorating thoughts from former years, 
Might fix the wavering balance of my wind, 
And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power 
May spur me on, in manhood now mature, 
To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes 
Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught 
To understand myself, nor thou to know 
With better knowledge how the heart was fram'd 
Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee 
Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit 
Those recollected hours that have the charm 
Of visionary things, and lovely forms 
And sweet sensations that throw back our life 
And almost make our Infancy itself 
A visible scene, on which the sun is shining? 

       One end hereby at least hath been attain'd, 
My mind hath been revived, and if this mood 
Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down, 
Through later years, the story of my life. 
The road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme 
Single and of determined bounds; and hence 
I chuse it rather at this time, than work 
Of ampler or more varied argument.

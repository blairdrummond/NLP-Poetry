Gaily bedight, 
   A gallant knight, 
In sunshine and in shadow,   
   Had journeyed long,   
   Singing a song, 
In search of Eldorado. 

   But he grew old-- 
   This knight so bold--   
And o'er his heart a shadow--   
   Fell as he found 
   No spot of ground 
That looked like Eldorado. 

   And, as his strength   
   Failed him at length, 
He met a pilgrim shadow--   
   'Shadow,' said he,   
   'Where can it be-- 
This land of Eldorado?' 

   'Over the Mountains 
   Of the Moon, 
Down the Valley of the Shadow,   
   Ride, boldly ride,' 
   The shade replied,-- 
'If you seek for Eldorado!'

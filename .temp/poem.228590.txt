My true-love hath my heart and I have his, 
By just exchange one for the other given: 
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss; 
There never was a bargain better driven. 
His heart in me keeps me and him in one; 
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides: 
He loves my heart, for once it was his own; 
I cherish his because in me it bides. 
His heart his wound received from my sight; 
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart; 
For as from me on him his hurt did light, 
So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart: 
Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss, 
My true love hath my heart and I have his.

 
Here they are. The soft eyes open.   
If they have lived in a wood 
It is a wood. 
If they have lived on plains 
It is grass rolling 
Under their feet forever. 

Having no souls, they have come,   
Anyway, beyond their knowing.   
Their instincts wholly bloom   
And they rise. 
The soft eyes open. 

To match them, the landscape flowers,   
Outdoing, desperately 
Outdoing what is required: 
The richest wood, 
The deepest field. 

For some of these, 
It could not be the place 
It is, without blood. 
These hunt, as they have done, 
But with claws and teeth grown perfect, 

More deadly than they can believe.   
They stalk more silently, 
And crouch on the limbs of trees,   
And their descent 
Upon the bright backs of their prey 

May take years 
In a sovereign floating of joy.   
And those that are hunted   
Know this as their life, 
Their reward: to walk 

Under such trees in full knowledge   
Of what is in glory above them,   
And to feel no fear, 
But acceptance, compliance.   
Fulfilling themselves without pain 

At the cycle's center, 
They tremble, they walk   
Under the tree, 
They fall, they are torn,   
They rise, they walk again.

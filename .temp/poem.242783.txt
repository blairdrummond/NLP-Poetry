Their long skirts and high heels battled away:
Depending on the ground's and breezes' whim,
At times some stocking shone, low on the limb--
Too soon concealed!--tickling our naivete.


At times, as well, an envious bug would bite
Our lovelies' necks beneath the boughs, and we
Would glimpse a flash--white flash, ah! ecstasy!--
And glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.


Evening would fall, the autumn day would draw
To its uncertain close: our belles would cling
Dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering
Lies that still set our souls trembling with awe.

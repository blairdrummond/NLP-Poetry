Leave him now quiet by the way 
To rest apart. 
I know what draws him to the dust alway 
And churns him in the builder's lime: 
He has the fright of time. 

I heard it knocking in his breast 
A minute since; 
His human eyes did wince, 
He stubborned like the massive slaughter beast 
And as a thing o'erwhelmed with sound 
Stood bolted to the ground. 

Leave him, for rest alone can cure-- 
If cure there be-- 
This waif upon the sea. 
He is of those who slanted the great door 
And listened--wretched little lad-- 
To what they said.

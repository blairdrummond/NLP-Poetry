Lord, how can man preach thy eternal word? 
    He is a brittle crazy glass; 
Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford 
    This glorious and transcendent place, 
    To be a window, through thy grace. 

But when thou dost anneal in glass thy story, 
    Making thy life to shine within 
The holy preachers, then the light and glory 
    More reverend grows, and more doth win; 
    Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin. 

Doctrine and life, colors and light, in one 
    When they combine and mingle, bring 
A strong regard and awe; but speech alone 
    Doth vanish like a flaring thing, 
    And in the ear, not conscience, ring.

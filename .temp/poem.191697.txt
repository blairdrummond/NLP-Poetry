"There's machinery in the butterfly;
         There's a mainspring to the bee;
There's hydraulics to a daisy,
         And contraptions to a tree.

"If we could see the birdie
         That makes the chirping sound
With x-ray, scientific eyes,
    We could see the wheels go round."

And I hope all men 
Who think like this 
Will soon lie 
Underground.

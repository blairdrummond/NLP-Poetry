Never the time and the place
         And the loved one all together!
This path?how soft to pace!
         This May?what magic weather!
Where is the loved one's face?
In a dream that loved one's face meets mine,
         But the house is narrow, the place is bleak
Where, outside, rain and wind combine
         With a furtive ear, if I strive to speak,
         With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,
With a malice that marks each word, each sign!
O enemy sly and serpentine,
Uncoil thee from the waking man!
         Do I hold the Past
         Thus firm and fast
Yet doubt if the Future hold I can?
This path so soft to pace shall lead
Thro' the magic of May to herself indeed!
Or narrow if needs the house must be,
Outside are the storms and strangers: we
Oh, close, safe, warm sleep I and she,?
I and she!

Will you read my little pome, 
O you girls returned home 
From a summertime of sport 
At the Jolliest Resort, 
From a Heated Term of joys 
Far from urban dust and noise? 

You I speak to in this rhyme, 
You have had a Glorious Time 
Swimming, golfing, bridging, dancing, 
Riding, tennising, romancing, 
On the springboard, on the raft-- 
You've been often photographed. 

At the place you have forsaken, 
You have had some pictures taken, 
Pictures taken of you dancing, 
Riding, tennising, romancing, 
Swimming, golfing, and reclining; 
Snacking, luncheoning, and dining. 

Cometh now my brief advice; 
Ladies, be ye ne'er so nice, 
Be ye ne'er so fascinating, 
Luring, drawing, captivating, 
If with interest you'd imbue us, 
Do not show those pictures to us! 

Snapshots of the links and lawn 
Cause in many of us a yawn; 
(As for me myself, why, I'm 
Glad to see 'em any time) 
But--I give it to you square-- 
Lots of people do not care.

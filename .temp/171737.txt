 
"It's a '49," Rhinehardt said, and slammed 
The screen door, then worked his way around 
The dog turds in the yard
To the Buick gutted from fire?the gears 
Teething rust, the fenders sloped
Like the shoulders of a fired worker 
Out of beer. He circled the car
Kicking the tires, eyeing
The grille that still grinned the ribbed wings 
Of a sparrow. He looked inside and flies 
Lifted like patted dust, settling
Into a loose knot on the visor.
"Yeh, you're right as right ... it's a '50," 
Rhinehardt spat, his tongue rolling
A false tooth into place. "It's got no
Running board." He pressed a buck
Into his son's hand and retired to the porch 
Where he towel-flicked
His wife from a chair
And as evening came on watched beyond 
The street, a kennel of trees,
Where?as he had dreamed?a plane would drop 
And bloom fire. Two bucks on that one.

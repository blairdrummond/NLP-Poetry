Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies 
Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she; 
And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries 
That sickness brags itself best graced to be. 
    Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise 
That in that paleness beauty's white we see; 
And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes, 
Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee. 
   Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page, 
As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make 
All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage; 
Nature with care sweats for her darling's sake, 
   Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find 
   Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind.

Tell me, 
Was Venus more beautiful 
Than you are, 
When she topped 
The crinkled waves, 
Drifting shoreward 
On her plaited shell? 
Was Botticelli's vision 
Fairer than mine; 
And were the painted rosebuds   
He tossed his lady 
Of better worth 
Than the words I blow about you 
To cover your too great loveliness   
As with a gauze 
Of misted silver? 

For me, 
You stand poised 
In the blue and buoyant air, 
Cinctured by bright winds, 
Treading the sunlight. 
And the waves which precede you   
Ripple and stir 
The sands at my feet.

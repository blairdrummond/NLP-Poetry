 
When I have fears that I may cease to be 
   Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, 
Before high-piled books, in charactery, 
   Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain; 
When I behold, upon the night's starred face, 
   Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, 
And think that I may never live to trace 
   Their shadows with the magic hand of chance; 
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, 
   That I shall never look upon thee more, 
Never have relish in the faery power 
   Of unreflecting love--then on the shore 
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think 
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

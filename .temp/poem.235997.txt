Alone it stands in Poesy's fair land, 
   A temple by the muses set apart; 
   A perfect structure of consummate art, 
By artists builded and by genius planned. 
Beyond the reach of the apprentice hand, 
   Beyond the ken of the unturtored heart, 
   Like a fine carving in a common mart, 
Only the favored few will understand. 
A chef-d'oeuvre toiled over with great care, 
   Yet which the unseeing careless crowd goes by, 
A plainly set, but well-cut solitaire, 
An ancient bit of pottery, too rare 
   To please or hold aught save the special eye, 
These only with the sonnet can compare.

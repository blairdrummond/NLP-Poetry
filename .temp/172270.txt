 
Wherever the flamingo goes,   
she brings a city's worth 
of furbelows. She seems 
unnatural by nature-- 
too vivid and peculiar 
a structure to be pretty, 
and flexible to the point   
of oddity. Perched on 
those legs, anything she does   
seems like an act. Descending   
on her egg or draping her head   
along her back, she's 
too exact and sinuous 
to convince an audience 
she's serious. The natural elect,   
they think, would be less pink,   
less able to relax their necks,   
less flamboyant in general. 
They privately expect that it's some   
poorly jointed bland grey animal   
with mitts for hands 
whom God protects.

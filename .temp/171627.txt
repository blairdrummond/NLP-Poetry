 
Rather than hold his hands properly   
arched off the keys, like cats 
with their backs up, 
Monk, playing block chords, 
hit the keys with his fingertips well   
above his wrists, 

shoulders up, wrists down, scarce   
room for the pencil, ground   
freshly to a point, 
piano teachers love to poke 
into the palms of junior 
pianists with lazy hands. 

What easy villains these robotic   
dullards are in their floral- 
print teaching dresses 
(can those mauve blurs be 
peonies?). The teachers' plucky,   
make-do wardrobes suggest, like the wan 

bloom of dust the couch exhaled   
when I scrunched down to wait   
for Mrs. Oxley, just how we value   
them. She'd launch my predecessor   
home and drink some lemonade,   
then free me from the couch. 

The wisdom in Rocky Mount, 
North Carolina, where Monk grew up,   
is that those names, Thelonious   
Sphere, came later, but nobody's   
sure: he made his escape 
by turning himself into a genius 

in broad daylight while nobody   
watched. Just a weird little black   
kid one day and next thing anybody   
knew he was inexplicable 
and gone. We don't give lessons   
in that. In fact it's to stave off 

such desertions that we pay 
for lessons. It works for a while.   
Think of all the time we spend   
thinking about our kids. 
It's Mrs. Oxley, the frump 
with a metronome, and Mr. Mote, 

the bad teacher and secret weeper,   
we might think on, and everyone   
we pay to tend our young, opaque   
and truculent and terrified,   
not yet ready to replace us,   
or escape us, if that be the work.

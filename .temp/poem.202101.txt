The poet is a man who feigns 
And feigns so thoroughly, at last 
He manages to feign as pain 
The pain he really feels,

And those who read what once he wrote
Feel clearly, in the pain they read,
Neither of the pains he felt,
Only a pain they cannot sense.

And thus, around its jolting track 
There runs, to keep our reason busy, 
The circling clockwork train of ours 
That men agree to call a heart.

I once rejoiced, sweet evening gale,
To see thy breath the poplar wave;
But now it makes my cheek turn pale,
It waves the grass o'er Henry's grave.

Ah! setting sun! how changed I seem!
I to thy rays prefer deep gloom, --
Since now, alas! I see them beam
Upon my Henry's lonely tomb.

Sweet evening gale, howe'er I seem,
I wish thee o'er my sod to wave;
Ah! setting sun! soon mayst thou beam
On mine, as well as Henry's grave!

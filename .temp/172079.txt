 
Stuck on the fridge, our favorite pin-up girl   
is anorexic. On the radio we have a riff 

of Muzak sax, and on the mind 
a self-help book. We sprawl all evening, all 

alone, in the unraised ranch;   
all day the company we kept 

kept on incorporating. As for the world   
of poverty, we did our best, thanks 

to a fund of Christian feeling   
and mementos from 

Amelia, the foster child, who has 
the rags and seven photogenic sisters we prefer 

in someone to be saved. She's proof   
Americans have got a heart 

to go with all that happy 
acumen you read about. We're known to love 

a million little prettinesses,   
decency, and ribbons on 

the cockapoo. (But who 
will study alphabets for hands? Who gives 

a damn what patience goes into 
a good wheelchair? Who lugs the rice 

from its umpteen stores 
to the ends of the earth, to even 

one dead-end? Not we.)   
Our constitutional pursuit 

is happiness, i.e.   
somebody nice, and not 

too fat, we can have   
for our personal friend.

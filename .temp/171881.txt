 
Night is longing, longing, longing,  beyond all endurance.  --Henry Miller 
The back roads I've traveled late   
at night, alone, a little drunk,   
wishing I were someone 
on whom nothing is lost, 

are the roads by day I take 
to the car wash in Hammonton   
or to Blue Anchor's 
lawnmower repair shop 
when the self-propel mechanism goes. 

Fascinating how the lamplight   
that's beckoned 
from solitary windows 
gives way to white shutters 
and occasionally a woman 
in her yard, bending over 
something conspicuously in bloom. 

So much then is duty, duty, duty,   
and so much 
with the sun visor tilted 
and destination known 
can be endured. 

But at night . . . no, even at night   
so much can be endured. 

I've known only one man   
who left the road, 
followed an intriguing light   
to its source. 
He told me 
that he knocked many times   
before it became clear to him   
he must break down the door.

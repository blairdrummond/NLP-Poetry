TO MOZART

What junipers are these, inlaid 
   With flame of the pomegranate tree? 
The god of gardens must have made 
   This still unrumored place for thee 
To rest from immortality, 
   And dream within the splendid shade 
Some more elusive symphony 
   Than orchestra has ever played. 


I In A major 
Poco sosteniao 

The laying tide of inarticulate air 
Breaks here in flowers as the sea in foam, 
But with no satin lisp of failing wave: 
The odor-laden winds are very still. 
An unimagined music here exhales 
In upcurled petal, dreamy bud half-furled, 
And variations of thin vivid leaf: 
Symphonic beauty that some god forgot. 
If form could waken into lyric sound, 
This flock of irises like poising birds 
Would feel song at their slender feathered throats, 
And pour into a grey-winged aria 
Their wrinkled silver fingermarked with pearl; 
That flight of ivory roses high along 
The airy azure of the larkspur spires 
Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales 
With tool-evasive rapture, phrase on phrase. 
Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash, 
And the black cypress like a deep bassoon 
Would hum a clouded amber melody. 

But all across the trudging ragged chords 
That are the tangled grasses in the heat, 
The mariposa lilies fluttering 
Like trills upon some archangelic flute, 

The roses and carnations and divine 
Small violets that voice the vanished god, 
There is a lure of passion-poignant tone 
Not flower-of-pomegranate--that finds the heart 
As stubborn oboes do--can breathe in air, 
Nor poppies, nor keen lime, nor orange-bloom. 

What zone of wonder in the ardent dusk 
Of trees that yearn and cannot understand, 
Vibrates as to the golden shepherd horn 
That stirs some great adagio with its cry 
And will not let it rest? 
                                       0 tender trees, 
Your orchid, like a shepherdess of dreams, 
Calls home her whitest dream from following 
Elusive laughter of the unmindful god! 

Vivace 

The iris people dance 
Like any nimble faun: 
To rhythmic radiance 
They foot it in the dawn. 
They dance and have no need 
Of crystal-dripping flute 
Or chuckling river-reed,-- 
Their music hovers mute. 
The dawn-lights flutter by 
All noiseless, but they know! 

Such children of the sky 
Can hear the darkness go. 
But does the morning play 
Whatever they demand-- 
Or amber-barred bourre
Or silver saraband? 


THE POOL

II. In A minor 
Allegretto 

Cool-hearted dim familiar of the doves, 
   Thou coiled sweet water where they come to tell 
Their mellow legends and rehearse their loves, 
   As what in April or in June befell 
 of, --friend of Dryades 
   Who lean to see where flower should be set 
      To star the dusk of wreathed ivy braids, 
         They have not left thy trees, 
   Nor do tired fauns thy crystal kiss forget, 
      Nor forest--nymphs astray from distant glades. 

Thou feelest with delight their showery feet 
   Along thy mossy margin myrtle-starred, 
And thine the heart of wildness quick to beat 
   At imprint of shy hoof upon thy sward: 
Yet who could know thee wild who art so cool, 
   So heavenly--minded, templed in thy grove 
      Of plumy cedar, larch and juniper? 
         O strange ecstatic Pool, 
What unknown country art thou dreaming of, 
   Or temple than this garden lovelier? 

Who made thy sky the silver side of leaves, 
   And poised its orchid like a swan--white moon 
Whose disc of perfect pallor half deceives 
   The mirror of thy limpid green lagoon, 
He loveth well thy ripple-feathered moods, 
   Thy whims at dusk, thy rainbow look at dawn! 
      Dream thou no more of vales Olympian: 
         Where pale Olympus broods 
   There were no orchid white as moon or swan, 
   No sky of leaves, no garden--haunting Pan! 


THE BIRDS

Ill In F major 
Presto 

I keep a frequent tryst 
With whirr and shower of wings: 
Some inward melodist 
Interpreting all things 
Appoints the place, the hours. 
Dazzle and sense of flowers, 
Though not the least leaf stir, 
May mean a tanager: 
How rich the silence is until he sings! 

The smoke-tree's cloudy white 
Has fire within its breast. 
What winged mere delight 
There hides as in a nest 
And fashions of its flame 
Music without a name? 
So might an opal sing 
If given thrilling wing, 
And voice for lyric wildness unexpressed. 

In grassy dimness thatched 
With tangled growing things, 
A troubadour rose-patched, 
With velvet-shadowed wings, 
Seeks a sustaining fly. 
Who else unseen goes by 
Quick-pattering through the hush? 
Some twilight-footed thrush 
Or finch intent on small adventurings? 

I have no time for gloom, 
For gloom what time have I? 
The orange is in bloom; 
Emerald parrots fly 
Out of the cypress-dusk; 
Morning is strange with musk. 
The wild canary now 
Jewels the lemon-bough, 
And mocking-birds laugh in the rose's room. 


THE ORANGE TREE

In D Major 
Presto meno assai 

The blossom-powdered orange tree, 
   For all her royal speechlessness, 
Out of a heart of ecstasy 
   Is singing, singing, none the less! 

Light as a springing fountain, she 
   Is spray above the wind-sleek turf: 
Dream-daughter of the moon's white sea 
   And sister to its showered surf! 


TO THE MOON

IV In A major 
Allegro con brio 

Moon that shone on Babylon, 
Searching out the gardens there, 
Could you find a fairer one 
Than this garden, anywhere? 
Did Damascus at her best 
Hide such beauty in her breast? 

When you flood with creamy light 
Vines that net the sombre pine, 
Turn the shadowed iris white, 
Summon cactus stars to shine, 
Do you free in silvered air 
Wistful spirits everywhere? 

Here they linger, there they pass, 
And forget their native heaven: 
Flit along the dewy grass 
Rare Vittoria, Sappho, even! 
And the hushed magnolia burns 
Incense in her gleaming urns. 

When the nightingale demands 
Word with Keats who answers him, 
Shakespeare listens--understands-- 
Mindful of the cherubim; 
And the South Wind dreads to know 
Mozart gone as seraphs go. 

Moon of poets dead and gone, 
Moon to gods of music dear, 
Gardens they have looked upon 
Let them re-discover here: 
Rest--and dream a little space 
Of some heart-remembered place!

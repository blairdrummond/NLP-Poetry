 


Efficient as Fate, 
each eye a storm trooper, 

the cleaners wipe my smile 
with Comet fingers   
and tear the plaster   
off my suicide note. 

They learn everything 
from the walls' eloquent tongues. 

Now, quick as genocide, 
they powder my ghost for a cinnamon jar. 

They burn my posters 
(India and Heaven in flames), 

whitewash my voicestains, 

make everything new,   
clean as Death. 


When the landlord brings new tenants,   
even Memory is a stranger. 

The woman, her womb solid with the future,   
instructs her husband's eyes   
to clutch insurance policies. 

They ignore my love affair with the furniture,   
the corner table that memorized   
my crossed-out lines. 

Oh, she's beautiful, 
a hard-nippled Madonna. 

The landlord gives them my autopsy;   
they sign the lease. 

The room is beating with bottled infants,   
and I've stopped beating. 

I'm moving out holding tombstones in my hands.

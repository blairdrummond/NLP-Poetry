 
"Yesterday the bird of night did sit, Even at noon-day, upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking."  --William Shakespeare 


Imagine waking 
to a scene of snow so new   
not even memories 
of other snow 
can mar its silken 
surface. What other innocence   
is quite like this, 
and who can blame me 
for refusing 
to violate such whiteness 
with the booted cruelty 
of tracks?

 
for Cesar Chavez
Field 

The wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth 
The small, almost invisible scars 
On my hands.

The pores in my throat and elbows
Have taken in a seed of dirt of their own.

After a day in the grape fields near Rolinda 
A fine silt, washed by sweat, 
Has settled into the lines 
On my wrists and palms.

Already I am becoming the valley, 
A soil that sprouts nothing. 
For any of us.

Wind 

A dry wind over the valley
Peeled mountains, grain by grain, 
To small slopes, loose dirt
Where red ants tunnel.

The wind strokes
The skulls and spines of cattle 
To white dust, to nothing,

Covers the spiked tracks of beetles, 
Of tumbleweed, of sparrows 
That pecked the ground for insects.

Evenings, when I am in the yard weeding, 
The wind picks up the breath of my armpits
Like dust, swirls it 
Miles away

And drops it
On the ear of a rabid dog, 
And I take on another life.

Wind 

When you got up this morning the sun 
Blazed an hour in the sky,

A lizard hid
Under the curled leaves of manzanita 
And winked its dark lids.

Later, the sky grayed,
And the cold wind you breathed
Was moving under your skin and already far 
From the small hives of your lungs.

Stars 

At dusk the first stars appear.
Not one eager finger points toward them. 
A little later the stars spread with the night 
And an orange moon rises
To lead them, like a shepherd, toward dawn.

Sun 

In June the sun is a bonnet of light 
Coming up,
Little by little,
From behind a skyline of pine.

The pastures sway with fiddle-neck, 
Tassels of foxtail.

At Piedra
A couple fish on the river's edge, 
Their shadows deep against the water. 
Above, in the stubbled slopes,
Cows climb down
As the heat rises
In a mist of blond locusts,
Returning to the valley.

Rain 

When autumn rains flatten sycamore leaves, 
The tiny volcanos of dirt
Ants raised around their holes,
I should be out of work.

My silverware and stack of plates will go unused 
Like the old, my two good slacks
Will smother under a growth of lint
And smell of the old dust
That rises
When the closet door opens or closes.

The skin of my belly will tighten like a belt 
And there will be no reason for pockets.

Harvest 

East of the sun's slant, in the vineyard that never failed, 
A wind crossed my face, moving the dust 
And a portion of my voice a step closer to a new year.

The sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays, 
And in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me 
From the thick harvest that was not mine.

Fog 

If you go to your window
You will notice a fog drifting in.

The sun is no stronger than a flashlight. 
Not all the sweaters 
Hung in closets all summer

Could soak up this mist. The fog:
A mouth nibbling everything to its origin, 
Pomegranate trees, stolen bicycles,

The string of lights at a used-car lot, 
A Pontiac with scorched valves.

In Fresno the fog is passing
The young thief prying a window screen, 
Graying my hair that falls
And goes unfound, my fingerprints 
Slowly growing a fur of dust?

One hundred years from now
There should be no reason to believe 
I lived.

Daybreak 

In this moment when the light starts up 
In the east and rubs 
The horizon until it catches fire,

We enter the fields to hoe,
Row after row, among the small flags of onion, 
Waving off the dragonflies 
That ladder the air.

And tears the onions raise
Do not begin in your eyes but in ours, 
In the salt blown
From one blister into another;

They begin in knowing
You will never waken to bear
The hour timed to a heart beat,
The wind pressing us closer to the ground.

When the season ends,
And the onions are unplugged from their sleep, 
We won't forget what you failed to see, 
And nothing will heal
Under the rain's broken fingers.

 
I 
However the image enters 
its force remains within 
my eyes 
rockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve   
wild for life, relentless and acquisitive   
learning to survive 
where there is no food 
my eyes are always hungry 
and remembering 
however the image enters 
its force remains. 
A white woman stands bereft and empty 
a black boy hacked into a murderous lesson   
recalled in me forever 
like a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep   
etched into my visions 
food for dragonfish that learn 
to live upon whatever they must eat 
fused images beneath my pain. 

    II 
The Pearl River floods through the streets of Jackson   
A Mississippi summer televised. 
Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain 
a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing boat   
her fingers tarry for a moment on the chimney   
now awash 
tearless and no longer young, she holds   
a tattered baby's blanket in her arms. 
In a flickering afterimage of the nightmare rain   
a microphone 
thrust up against her flat bewildered words 
          "we jest come from the bank yestiddy   
                   borrowing money to pay the income tax   
                   now everything's gone. I never knew   
                   it could be so hard." 
Despair weighs down her voice like Pearl River mud   
caked around the edges 
her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation 
unanswered 
she shifts her search across the watered street, dry-eyed   
                   "hard, but not this hard." 
Two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her   
hanging upon her coat like mirrors 
until a man with ham-like hands pulls her aside   
snarling "She ain't got nothing more to say!" 
and that lie hangs in his mouth 
like a shred of rotting meat. 

    III 
I inherited Jackson, Mississippi. 
For my majority it gave me Emmett Till   
his 15 years puffed out like bruises   
on plump boy-cheeks 
his only Mississippi summer 
whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie 
as a white girl passed him in the street   
and he was baptized my son forever   
in the midnight waters of the Pearl. 

His broken body is the afterimage of my 21st year 
when I walked through a northern summer 
my eyes averted 
from each corner's photographies   
newspapers protest posters magazines   
Police Story, Confidential, True   
the avid insistence of detail 
pretending insight or information 
the length of gash across the dead boy's loins 
his grieving mother's lamentation   
the severed lips, how many burns   
his gouged out eyes 
sewed shut upon the screaming covers   
louder than life 
all over 
the veiled warning, the secret relish   
of a black child's mutilated body   
fingered by street-corner eyes   
bruise upon livid bruise 
and wherever I looked that summer 
I learned to be at home with children's blood 
with savored violence 
with pictures of black broken flesh   
used, crumpled, and discarded   
lying amid the sidewalk refuse   
like a raped woman's face. 

A black boy from Chicago 
whistled on the streets of Jackson, Mississippi 
testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to do 
his teachers 
ripped his eyes out his sex his tongue 
and flung him to the Pearl weighted with stone 
in the name of white womanhood 
they took their aroused honor 
back to Jackson 
and celebrated in a whorehouse 
the double ritual of white manhood 
confirmed. 

    IV 
    "If earth and air and water do not judge them who are 
      we to refuse a crust of bread?" 


Emmett Till rides the crest of the Pearl, whistling 
24 years his ghost lay like the shade of a raped woman   
and a white girl has grown older in costly honor   
(what did she pay to never know its price?) 
now the Pearl River speaks its muddy judgment   
and I can withhold my pity and my bread. 

            "Hard, but not this hard." 
Her face is flat with resignation and despair   
with ancient and familiar sorrows 
a woman surveying her crumpled future 
as the white girl besmirched by Emmett's whistle   
never allowed her own tongue 
without power or conclusion 
unvoiced 
she stands adrift in the ruins of her honor   
and a man with an executioner's face 
pulls her away. 

Within my eyes 
the flickering afterimages of a nightmare rain 
a woman wrings her hands 
beneath the weight of agonies remembered 
I wade through summer ghosts   
betrayed by vision 
hers and my own 
becoming dragonfish to survive   
the horrors we are living 
with tortured lungs 
adapting to breathe blood. 

A woman measures her life's damage 
my eyes are caves, chunks of etched rock 
tied to the ghost of a black boy   
whistling 
crying and frightened 
her tow-headed children cluster   
like little mirrors of despair   
their father's hands upon them   
and soundlessly 
a woman begins to weep.

 
I. 

They let me go 
at night, minus my timepiece, lighter,   
personal effects. The air is always shaking   
the same jars of safety pins: cicadas.   
Song is my recidivism: always 
I'm abandoning the road to stand 
(unwatched, unseconded) in someone's   
field. The stars (that are not mine) 

tick fitfully, they always have 
appointments. Punctual, six-sharp, 
they are David's; they have lodged in his 
death tent, have stuck in his mud sleep. Bad luck 

leaves me a loan: no company, no katy- 
did or promissory 
note or night 
can last. 
The air 
loses its nerve, 
the old saw its eyeteeth and I 
my words--my alwaysing and my. 

   II. 

In hush the repossessors reach   
the edges of the field. They pass 

for shadows, sheep of ambush, animals of   
permanence. They turn a black beyond returning 

and they haunt the sleepless. I don't count,   
who cannot earn my keep.

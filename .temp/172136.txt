 
Wahiawa is still 
a red dirt town 
where the sticky smell   
of pineapples 
being lopped off 
in the low-lying fields   
rises to mix 
with the minty leaves   
of eucalyptus 
in the bordering gulch. 

We lived there 
near the edge 
where the orchids grew huge   
as lanterns overnight 
and the passion fruits rotted   
on the vines 
before they could be picked. 

We grew there 
in the steady rain 
that fell like a gray curtain   
through which my mother peered:   
patches of depression. 
She kept the children under cover.   
We built houses within houses,   
stripping our parents' bed 
of pillows and sheets, 
erecting walls out of 
The National Geographic 
which my father had subscribed to 
for years. We feasted 
on those pictures of the world, 
while the mud oozed 
past the windows 
knocking over the drab green leaves 
of palm fronds 
as we ate our spinach. 
The mildew grew in rings 
around the sink 
where centipedes came 
swimming up the pipes 
on multiple feet   
and the mold grew   
around our small fingers 
making everything slippery 
to touch. 
We were squeamish and pale. 

I remember one night   
my sister screamed. 
All the lights blinked on   
in the house. 
In the sudden brightness,   
we rushed to her room   
and found her crumpled 
in the far corner of the bed, 
her nightgown twisted in a strange shape;   
her eyes were as huge as mine, 
staring into the eyes of the bat   
that clung to the screen.   
Its rodent fingers 
finally letting go 
as my father jabbed its furry body 
with the end of a broom.

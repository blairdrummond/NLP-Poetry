 
Long ago we quit lifting our heels 
like the others--horse, dog, and tiger-- 
though we thrill to their speed 
as they flee. Even the mouse 
bearing the great weight of a nugget   
of dog food is enviably graceful. 
There is little spring to our walk, 
we are so burdened with responsibility,   
all of the disciplinary actions 
that have fallen to us, the punishments,   
the killings, and all with our feet 
bound stiff in the skins of the conquered.   
But sometimes, in the early hours,   
we can feel what it must have been like   
to be one of them, up on our toes, 
stealing past doors where others are sleeping,   
and suddenly able to see in the dark.

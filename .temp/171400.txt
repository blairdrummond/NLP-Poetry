 
The house is so quiet now 
The vacuum cleaner sulks in the corner closet,   
Its bag limp as a stopped lung, its mouth   
Grinning into the floor, maybe at my 
Slovenly life, my dog-dead youth. 

I've lived this way long enough, 
But when my old woman died her soul 
Went into that vacuum cleaner, and I can't bear   
To see the bag swell like a belly, eating the dust   
And the woolen mice, and begin to howl 

Because there is old filth everywhere 
She used to crawl, in the corner and under the stair.   
I know now how life is cheap as dirt,   
And still the hungry, angry heart   
Hangs on and howls, biting at air.

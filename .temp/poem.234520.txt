Act I, Scene viii, Air X--"Thomas, I Cannot,"
Polly.          I like a ship in storms was tossed,
                        Yet afraid to put into land,
                   For seized in the port the vessel's lost
                        Whose treasure is contraband.
                           The waves are laid,
                           My duty's paid;
                        O joy beyond expression!
                           Thus safe ashore
                           I ask no more;
                        My all is in my possession.

 
He approaches her, trailing his whole fortune, 
Perfectly cocksure, and suddenly spreads 
The huge fan of his tail for her amazement. 

Each turquoise and purple, black-horned, walleyed quill 
Comes quivering forward, an amphitheatric shell 
For his most fortunate audience: her alone. 

He plumes himself. He shakes his brassily gold 
Wings and rump in a dance, lifting his claws 
Stiff-legged under the great bulge of his breast. 

And she strolls calmly away, pecking and pausing, 
Not watching him, astonished to discover 
All these seeds spread just for her in the dirt.

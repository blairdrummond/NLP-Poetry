 
When I was fair and young, then favor graced me. 
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be. 
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore: 
Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more. 

How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe, 
How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show, 
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore: 
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. 

Then spake fair Venus' son, that proud victorious boy, 
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy, 
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more: 
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. 

As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast 
That neither night nor day I could take any rest. 
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before: 
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

O but we talked at large before 
The sixteen men were shot, 
But who can talk of give and take, 
What should be and what not 
While those dead men are loitering there 
To stir the boiling pot? 

You say that we should still the land 
Till Germany's overcome; 
But who is there to argue that 
Now Pearse is deaf and dumb? 
And is their logic to outweigh 
MacDonagh's bony thumb? 

How could you dream they'd listen 
That have an ear alone 
For those new comrades they have found, 
Lord Edward and Wolfe Tone, 
Or meddle with our give and take 
That converse bone to bone?

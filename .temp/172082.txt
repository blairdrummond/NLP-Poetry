 
I've stayed in the front yard all my life. 
I want a peek at the back 
Where it's rough and untended and hungry weed grows.   
A girl gets sick of a rose. 

I want to go in the back yard now   
And maybe down the alley, 
To where the charity children play.   
I want a good time today. 

They do some wonderful things. 
They have some wonderful fun. 
My mother sneers, but I say it's fine 
How they don't have to go in at quarter to nine.   
My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae   
Will grow up to be a bad woman. 
That George'll be taken to Jail soon or late 
(On account of last winter he sold our back gate). 

But I say it's fine. Honest, I do. 
And I'd like to be a bad woman, too, 
And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace   
And strut down the streets with paint on my face.

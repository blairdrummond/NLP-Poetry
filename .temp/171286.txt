 
My mother had two faces and a frying pot   
where she cooked up her daughters 
into girls 
before she fixed our dinner. 
My mother had two faces 
and a broken pot 
where she hid out a perfect daughter   
who was not me 
I am the sun and moon and forever hungry   
for her eyes. 

I bear two women upon my back   
one dark and rich and hidden 
in the ivory hungers of the other   
mother 
pale as a witch 
yet steady and familiar 
brings me bread and terror 
in my sleep 
her breasts are huge exciting anchors   
in the midnight storm. 

All this has been 
before 
in my mother's bed 
time has no sense 
I have no brothers 
and my sisters are cruel. 

Mother I need 
mother I need 
mother I need your blackness now   
as the august earth needs rain.   
I am 

the sun and moon and forever hungry   
the sharpened edge 
where day and night shall meet 
and not be 
one.

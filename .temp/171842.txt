 
Shall I say how it is in your clothes? 
A month after your death I wear your blue jacket.   
The dog at the center of my life recognizes   
you've come to visit, he's ecstatic. 
In the left pocket, a hole. 
In the right, a parking ticket 
delivered up last August on Bay State Road.   
In my heart, a scatter like milkweed, 
a flinging from the pods of the soul. 
My skin presses your old outline. 
It is hot and dry inside. 

I think of the last day of your life, 
old friend, how I would unwind it, paste   
it together in a different collage, 
back from the death car idling in the garage,   
back up the stairs, your praying hands unlaced,   
reassembling the bits of bread and tuna fish   
into a ceremony of sandwich, 
running the home movie backward to a space   
we could be easy in, a kitchen place 
with vodka and ice, our words like living meat. 

Dear friend, you have excited crowds 
with your example. They swell 
like wine bags, straining at your seams.   
I will be years gathering up our words,   
fishing out letters, snapshots, stains, 
leaning my ribs against this durable cloth 
to put on the dumb blue blazer of your death.

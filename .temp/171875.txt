 
Back when it took all day to come up 
from the curving broad ponds on the plains 
where the green-winged jacanas ran on the lily pads 

easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges 
crossing villages silted in hollows 
in the foothills 
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square   
of red earth and its 
talkers eating fruit under trees 

turning a corner and catching 
sight at last of inky forests far above 
steep as faces 
with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering   
airy valleys opening out of them 

waterfalls still roared from the folds   
of the mountain 
white and thundering and spray drifted   
around us swirling into the broad leaves   
and the waiting boughs 

once I took a tin cup and climbed 
the sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside   
one of the high falls 
looking up step by step into 
the green sky from which rain was falling 
when I looked back from a ledge there were only   
dripping leaves below me 
and flowers 

beside me the hissing 
cataract plunged into the trees 
holding on I moved closer 
left foot on a rock in the water 
right foot on a rock in deeper water   
at the edge of the fall 
then from under the weight of my right foot   
came a voice like a small bell singing   
over and over one clear treble   
syllable 

I could feel it move 
I could feel it ring in my foot in my skin   
everywhere 
in my ears in my hair 
I could feel it in my tongue and in the hand   
holding the cup 
as long as I stood there it went on 
without changing 

when I moved the cup 
still it went on 
when I filled the cup 
in the falling column 
still it went on 
when I drank it rang in my eyes 
through the thunder curtain 

when I filled the cup again   
when I raised my foot   
still it went on 
and all the way down   
from wet rock to wet rock   
green branch to green branch 
it came with me 

until I stood 
looking up and we drank 
the light water 
and when we went on we could 
still hear the sound 
as far as the next turn on the way over

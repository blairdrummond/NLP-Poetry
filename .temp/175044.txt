 
Rigid Body (sings).
Gin a body meet a body
      Flyin' through the air,
Gin a body hit a body,
      Will it fly? and where?
Ilka impact has its measure,
      Ne'er a ane hae I,
Yet a' the lads they measure me,
      Or, at least, they try.

Gin a body meet a body
      Altogether free,
How they travel afterwards
      We do not always see.
Ilka problem has its method
      By analytics high;
For me, I ken na ane o' them,
      But what the waur am I?

Cyriack, this three years' day these eyes, though clear 
       To outward view of blemish or of spot, 
       Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; 
       Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear 
Of sun or moon or star throughout the year, 
       Or man or woman. Yet I argue not 
       Against Heav'n's hand or will, not bate a jot 
       Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer 
Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask? 
       The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied 
       In liberty's defence, my noble task, 
Of which all Europe talks from side to side. 
       This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask 
       Content, though blind, had I no better guide.

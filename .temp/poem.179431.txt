xxxiii, 46-48, 52-66
As I drew nearer to the end of all desire, 
I brought my longing's ardor to a final height, 
Just as I ought. My vision, becoming pure, 

Entered more and more the beam of that high light 
That shines on its own truth. From then, my seeing 
Became too large for speech, which fails at a sight 

Beyond all boundaries, at memory's undoing-- 
As when the dreamer sees and after the dream 
The passion endures, imprinted on his being 

Though he can't recall the rest. I am the same: 
Inside my heart, although my vision is almost 
Entirely faded, droplets of its sweetness come 

The way the sun dissolves the snow's crust-- 
The way, in the wind that stirred the light leaves,   
The oracle that the Sibyl wrote was lost.

 
of Paradys ne can not I speken propurly ffor I was not there
        - Mandeville
The stars of the Great Bear drift apart 
The Horse and the Rider together northeastward 
Alpha and Omega asunder   
The others diversely 
There are rocks 
On the earth more durable 
Than the configurations of heaven 
Species now motile and sanguine   
Shall see the stars in new clusters   
The beaches changed 
The mountains shifted   
Gigantic 
Immobile 
Floodlit 
The faces appear and disappear   
Chewing the right gum   
Smoking the right cigarette   
Buying the best refrigerator   
The polished carnivorous teeth   
Exhibited in approval 
The lights 
Of the houses 
Draw together 
In the evening dewfall on the banks 
Of the Wabash 
Sparkle discreetly 
High on the road to Provo   
Above the Salt Lake Valley   
And 
The mountain shaped like a sphinx   
And 
The mountain shaped like a finger   
Pointing 
On the first of April at eight o'clock   
Precisely at Algol 
There are rocks on the earth   
And one who sleepless 
Throbbed with the ten 
Nightingales in the plum trees   
Sleepless as Bootes stood over him   
Gnawing the pillow 
Sitting on the bed's edge smoking   
Sitting by the window looking   
One who rose in the false   
Dawn and stoned 
The nightingales in the garden   
The heart pawned for wisdom   
The heart 
Bartered for knowledge and folly   
The will troubled 
The mind secretly aghast 
The eyes and lips full of sorrow   
The apices of vision wavering 
As the flower spray at the tip of the windstalk   
The becalmed sail 
The heavy wordless weight   
And now 
The anguishing and pitiless file   
Cutting away life 
Capsule by capsule biting   
Into the heart 
The coal of fire 
Sealing the lips 
There are rocks on earth 

And 

In the Japanese quarter 
A phonograph playing 
"Moonlight on ruined castles"   
Kojo n'suki 

And 
The movement of the wind fish   
Keeping time to the music 
Sirius setting behind it 
(The Dog has scented the sun) 
Gold immense fish   
Squirm in the trade wind   
"Young Middle Western woman 
In rut 
Desires correspondent"   
The first bright flower   
Cynoglossum 
The blue hound's tongue   
Breaks on the hill   
"The tide has gone down   
Over the reef 
I walk about the world   
There is great 
Wind and then rain" 
"My life is bought and paid for 
So much pleasure 
For so much pain" 
The folded fossiliferous   
Sedimentary rocks end here 
The granite batholith   
Obtrudes abruptly   
West of the fault line   
Betelgeuse reddens 
Drawing its substance about it 
It is possible that a process is beginning   
Similar to that which lifted   
The great Sierra fault block   
Through an older metamorphic range 

(The Dog barks on the sun's spoor)   

Now 

The thought of death 
Binds fast the flood of light 
Ten years ago the snow falling 
All a long winter night 
I had lain waking in my bed alone   
Turning my heavy thoughts 
And no way might 
Sleep 
Remembering divers things long gone 
Now 
In the long day in the hour of small shadow   
I walk on the continent's last western hill   
And lie prone among the iris in the grass   
My eyes fixed on the durable stone 
That speaks and hears as though it were myself

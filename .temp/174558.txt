 
One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, is: 
Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly this. 

What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and under: 
If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without thunder. 

Doubt is faith in the main: but faith, on the whole, is doubt: 
We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe without? 

Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not clover: 
Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and over. 

Two and two may be four: but four and four are not eight: 
Fate and God may be twain: but God is the same thing as fate. 

Ask a man what he thinks, and get from a man what he feels: 
God, once caught in the fact, shows you a fair pair of heels. 

Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is which: 
The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk in a ditch. 

More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the whole: 
Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the soul? 

One and two are not one: but one and nothing is two: 
Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be true. 

Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as cocks: 
Then the mammoth was God: now is He a prize ox. 

Parallels all things are: yet many of these are askew: 
You are certainly I: but certainly I am not you. 

Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the rock: 
Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the cock. 

God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we see: 
Fiddle, we know, is diddle: and diddle, we take it, is dee.

 


The children of the Czar   
Played with a bouncing ball 

In the May morning, in the Czar's garden,   
Tossing it back and forth. 

It fell among the flowerbeds   
Or fled to the north gate. 

A daylight moon hung up 
In the Western sky, bald white. 

Like Papa's face, said Sister,   
Hurling the white ball forth.

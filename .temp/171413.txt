 


Water roared everywhere around us, yet from the bank   
all we could see of it were quick spumes and flashes   
here and there, in among the boulders. Cautiously,   
as if they might awaken, we clambered over   
the gigantic slabs and humps, the sun-baked ovals   
lumpy as hammered clay, and saw downstream below us   
only the vague shapes of others, almost billowy,   
like magnified amoebas, stretching away to even   
vaguer ones beyond them, turning the narrow   
streambed through the valley to a lunar seam.

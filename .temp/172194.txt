 
Interesting that I have to live with my skeleton.   
It stands, prepared to emerge, and I carry it 
with me--this other thing I will become at death,   
and yet it keeps me erect and limber in my walk,   
my rival. 

What will the living see of me 
if they should open my grave but my bones   
that will stare at them through hollow sockets   
and bared teeth. 

I write this to warn my friends 
not to be shocked at my changed attitude   
toward them, but to be aware 
that I have it in me to be someone 
other than I am, and I write to ask forgiveness   
that death is not wholesome for friendships,   
that bones do not talk, have no quarrel with me,   
do not even know I exist. 

A machine called skeleton will take my place   
in the minds of others when I am dead   
among the living, and that machine   
will make it obvious that I have died   
to be identified by bones 
that have no speech, no thought, no mind   
to speak of having let themselves be carried   
once around in me, as at my service   
at the podium or as I lay beside my love   
or when I held my child at birth 
or embraced a friend or shook a critic's hand   
or held a pen to sign a check or book 
or wrote a farewell letter to a love 
or held my penis at the bowl 
or lay my hand upon my face at the mirror   
and approved of it. 

There is Ignatow, it will be said, 
looking down inside the open grave.   
I'll be somewhere in my poems, I think, 
to be mistaken for my bones, but There's Ignatow   
will be said. I say to those who persist,   
just read what I have written. 
I'll be there, held together by another kind   
of structure, of thought and imagery, 
mind and matter, love and longing, tensions   
opposite, such as the skeleton requires   
to stand upright, to move with speed, 
to sit with confidence, my friend the skeleton   
and I its friend, shielding it from harm.

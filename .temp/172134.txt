 
Nothing nastier than a white person! 
She mutters as she irons alterations 
in the backroom of Charlotte's Dress Shoppe.   
The steam rising from a cranberry wool   
comes alive with perspiration 
and stale Evening of Paris. 
Swamp she born from, swamp 
she swallow, swamp she got to sink again. 

The iron shoves gently 
into a gusset, waits until 
the puckers bloom away. Beyond   
the curtain, the white girls are all 
wearing shoulder pads to make their faces   
delicate. That laugh would be Autumn,   
tossing her hair in imitation of Bacall. 

Beulah had read in the library 
how French ladies at court would tuck   
their fans in a sleeve 
and walk in the gardens for air. Swaying   
among lilies, lifting shy layers of silk,   
they dropped excrement as daintily   
as handkerchieves. Against all rules 

she had saved the lining from a botched coat   
to face last year's gray skirt. She knows   
whenever she lifts a knee 
she flashes crimson. That seems legitimate;   
but in the book she had read 
how the cavaliere amused themselves 
wearing powder and perfume and spraying 
yellow borders knee-high on the stucco   
of the Orangerie. 

A hanger clatters 
in the front of the shoppe. 
Beulah remembers how 
even Autumn could lean into a settee 
with her ankles crossed, sighing 
I need a man who'll protect me 
while smoking her cigarette down to the very end.

 
Whatever city or country road   
you two are on 
there are nettles, 
and the dark invisible 
elements cling to your skin 
though you do not cry 
and you do not scratch 
your arms at forty-five degree angles   
as the landing point of a swan 
in the Ohio, the Detroit River; 

at the Paradise Theatre 
you named the cellist 
with the fanatical fingers 
of the plumber, the exorcist, 
and though the gimmicky at wrist   
and kneecaps could lift the seance   
table, your voice was real 
in the gait and laughter of Uncle   
Henry, who could dance on either   
leg, wooden or real, to the sound   
of the troop train, megaphone,   
catching the fine pitch of a singer   
on the athletic fields of Virginia. 

At the Radisson Hotel, 
we once took a fine angel 
of the law to the convention center,   
and put her down as an egret 
in the subzero platform of a friend-- 
this is Minneapolis, the movies 
are all of strangers, holding themselves   
in the delicacy of treading water,   
while they wait for the trumpet   
of the 20th Century Limited 
over the bluff or cranny. 
You two men like to confront. 
the craters of history and spillage,   
our natural infections of you   
innoculating blankets and fur,   
ethos of cadaver and sunflower. 

I hold the dogwood blossom, 
eat the pear, and watch the nettle   
swim up in the pools 
of the completed song 
of Leadbelly and Little Crow   
crooning the buffalo and horse   
to the changes and the bridge   
of a twelve-string guitar, 
the melody of "Irene"; 
this is really goodbye-- 
I can see the precious stones 
of embolism and consumption 
on the platinum wires of the mouth: 
in the flowing rivers, in the public baths   
of Ohio and Michigan.

 
for Robert Lowell
We smile at each other 
and I lean back against the wicker couch.   
How does it feel to be dead? I say. 
You touch my knees with your blue fingers.   
And when you open your mouth, 
a ball of yellow light falls to the floor   
and burns a hole through it. 
Don't tell me, I say. I don't want to hear.   
Did you ever, you start, 
wear a certain kind of silk dress 
and just by accident, 
so inconsequential you barely notice it,   
your fingers graze that dress 
and you hear the sound of a knife cutting paper,   
you see it too 
and you realize how that image 
is simply the extension of another image,   
that your own life 
is a chain of words 
that one day will snap. 
Words, you say, young girls in a circle, holding hands,   
and beginning to rise heavenward 
in their confirmation dresses, 
like white helium balloons, 
the wreaths of flowers on their heads spinning, 
and above all that, 
that's where I'm floating,   
and that's what it's like 
only ten times clearer, 
ten times more horrible.   
Could anyone alive survive it?

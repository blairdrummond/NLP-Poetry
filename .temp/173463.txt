 
W'en daih's chillun in de house,
   Dey keep on a-gittin' tall;
But de folks don' seem to see
   Dat dey's growin' up at all,
'Twell dey fin' out some fine day
   Dat de gals has 'menced to grow,
W'en dey notice as dey pass
   Dat de front gate's saggin' low.

W'en de hinges creak an' cry,
   An' de bahs go slantin' down,
You kin reckon dat hit's time
   Fu' to cas' yo' eye erroun',
'Cause daih ain't no 'sputin' dis,
   Hit's de trues' sign to show
Dat daih's cou'tin goin' on
   W'en de ol' front gate sags low.

Oh, you grumble an' complain,
   An' you prop dat gate up right;
But you notice right nex' day

So you fin' dat hit's a rule,
   An' daih ain' no use to blow,
W'en de gals is growin' up,
   Dat de front gate will sag low.

Den you t'ink o' yo' young days,

An' you so't o' feel ashamed
   Fu' to grumble an' complain,
'Cause yo' ricerlection says,
   An' you know hits wo'ds is so,
Dat huh pappy had a time
   Wid his front gate saggin' low.

So you jes' looks on an' smiles

Tryin' to t'ink whut he kin say
   Fu' to keep him daih so late,
But you lets dat gate erlone,
   Fu' yo' 'sperunce goes to show,
'Twell de gals is ma'ied off,
   It gwine keep on saggin' low.

 
That day I hired a private detective to follow me,   
and could not read his notes. In a tangled grove,   
I hid behind white pines, compressed my body,   
then watched him write, left-handed and myopic,   
under an Irish cap, when I asked for help   
from strangers who spoke Slavic languages.   
Wary, moving ahead, I found a depot, 
watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam,   
and boarded, second class. I had no ticket,   
and my expired passport represented 
a drooping head with unfamiliar eyes. 
Unshaken, rows behind, the stranger waited,   
wielding camera and pen. Across the border 
I disembarked, but knew he would capture me,   
with soundless footsteps, even on black gravel. 

I tried to recall my crime. I know I am guilty, 
but never why. Lawless, I have ignored 
those signs: WRONG WAY; GO BACK and NO WAY OUT,   
circles that tell me YOU ARE HERE. I gather 
it is the whispers that explode, the looks 
that make dogs whimper. When I bow in prayer 
I think of love; I know I've killed my friends, 
pelting them with a touch--and yet I've heard 
they are alive. Besides, that's not the real 

offense. I would cross any path, or trek 
through swamps to find my crime. But even he,   
that bald, insistent man who follows me,   
unsleeping, cannot tell me what I've done.

The length o' days agean do shrink 
   An' flowers be thin in mead, among 
   The eegrass a-sheenen bright, along 
Brook upon brook, an' brink by brink. 

   Noo starlens do rise in vlock on wing-- 
   Noo goocoo in nest-green leaves do sound-- 
   Noo swallows be now a-wheelen round-- 
Dip after dip, an' swing by swing. 

   The wheat that did leately rustle thick 
   Is now up in mows that still be new, 
   An' yollow bevore the sky o' blue-- 
Tip after tip, an' rick by rick. 

   While now I can walk a dusty mile 
   I'll teake me a day, while days be clear, 
   To vind a vew friends that still be dear, 
Feace after feace, an' smile by smile.

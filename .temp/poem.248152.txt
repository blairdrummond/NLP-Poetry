Lying is an occupation, 
     Used by all who mean to rise;
Politicians owe their station, 
     But to well concerted lies. 

These to lovers give assistance, 
     To ensnare the fair-one's heart; 
And the virgin's best resistance 
     Yields to this commanding art. 

Study this superior science, 
     Would you rise in Church or State; 
Bid to Truth a bold defiance, 
     'Tis the practice of the great.

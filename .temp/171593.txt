 
The dove-white gulls 
on the wet lawn in Washington Square   
in the early morning fog 
each a little ghost in the gloaming 
Souls transmigrated maybe 
from Hudson's shrouded shores 
across all the silent years-- 
Which one's my maybe mafioso father   
in his so white suit and black shoes 
in his real estate office Forty-second Street   
or at the front table wherever he went-- 
Which my dear lost mother with faded smile   
locked away from me in time-- 
Which my big brother Charley 
selling switching-signals all his life 
on the New York Central-- 
And which good guy brother Clem 
sweating in Sing Sing's darkest offices   
deputy-warden thirty years 
watching executions in the wooden armchair   
(with leather straps and black hood) 
He too gone mad with it in the end-- 
And which my nearest brother Harry 
still kindest and dearest in a far suburb-- 
I see them now all turn to me at last   
gull-eyed in the white dawn 
about to call to me 
across the silent grass

 
A little heat caught 
in gleaming rags, 
in shrouds of veil, 
   torn and sun-shot swaddlings: 

   over the Methodist roof, 
two clouds propose a Zion 
of their own, blazing 
   (colors of tarnish on copper) 

   against the steely close 
of a coastal afternoon, December, 
while under the steeple 
   the Choral Society 

   prepares to perform 
Messiah, pouring, in their best 
blacks and whites, onto the raked stage. 
   Not steep, really, 

   but from here, 
the first pew, they're a looming 
cloudbank of familiar angels: 
   that neighbor who 

   fights operatically 
with her girlfriend, for one, 
and the friendly bearded clerk 
   from the post office 

   --tenor trapped 
in the body of a baritone? Altos 
from the A&P, soprano 
   from the T-shirt shop: 

   today they're all poise, 
costume and purpose 
conveying the right note 
   of distance and formality. 

   Silence in the hall, 
anticipatory, as if we're all 
about to open a gift we're not sure 
   we'll like; 

   how could they 
compete with sunset's burnished 
oratorio? Thoughts which vanish, 
   when the violins begin. 

   Who'd have thought 
they'd be so good? Every valley, 
proclaims the solo tenor, 
   (a sleek blonde 

   I've seen somewhere before 
--the liquor store?) shall be exalted, 
and in his handsome mouth the word 
   is lifted and opened 

   into more syllables 
than we could count, central ah 
dilated in a baroque melisma, 
   liquefied; the pour 

   of voice seems 
to make the unplaned landscape 
the text predicts the Lord 
   will heighten and tame. 

   This music 
demonstrates what it claims: 
glory shall be revealed. If art's 
   acceptable evidence, 

   mustn't what lies 
behind the world be at least 
as beautiful as the human voice? 
   The tenors lack confidence, 

   and the soloists, 
half of them anyway, don't 
have the strength to found 
   the mighty kingdoms 

   these passages propose 
--but the chorus, all together, 
equals my burning clouds, 
   and seems itself to burn, 

   commingled powers 
deeded to a larger, centering claim. 
These aren't anyone we know; 
   choiring dissolves 

   familiarity in an up- 
pouring rush which will not 
rest, will not, for a moment, 
   be still. 

   Aren't we enlarged 
by the scale of what we're able 
to desire? Everything, 
   the choir insists, 

   might flame; 
inside these wrappings 
burns another, brighter life, 
   quickened, now, 

   by song: hear how 
it cascades, in overlapping, 
lapidary waves of praise? Still time. 
   Still time to change.

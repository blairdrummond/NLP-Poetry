Grand Cayman
This tuft that thrives on saline nothingness, 
Inverted octopus with heavenward arms 
Thrust parching from a palm-bole hard by the cove? 
A bird almost?of almost bird alarms, 

Is pulmonary to the wind that jars 
Its tentacles, horrific in their lurch. 
The lizard's throat, held bloated for a fly, 
Balloons but warily from this throbbing perch. 

The needles and hack-saws of cactus bleed 
A milk of earth when stricken off the stalk; 
But this,?defenseless, thornless, sheds no blood, 
Almost no shadow?but the air's thin talk. 

Angelic Dynamo! Ventriloquist of the Blue! 
While beachward creeps the shark-swept Spanish Main 
By what conjunctions do the winds appoint 
Its apotheosis, at last?the hurricane!

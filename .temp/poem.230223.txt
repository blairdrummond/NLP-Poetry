It's my belief that every man 
   Should do his share of work, 
And in our economic plan 
   No citizen should shirk. 
That in return each one should get 
   His meed of fold and food, 
And feel that all his toil and sweat 
   Is for the common good. 

It's my belief that every chap 
   Should have an equal start, 
And there should be no handicap 
   To hinder his depart; 
That there be fairness in the fight, 
   And justice in the race, 
And every lad should have the right 
   To win his proper place. 

It's my belief that people should 
   Be neither rich nor poor; 
That none should suffer servitude, 
   And all should be secure. 
That wealth is loot, and rank is rot, 
   And foul is class and clan; 
That to succeed a man may not 
   Exploit his brother man. 

It's my belief that heritage 
   And usury are wrong; 
That each should win a worthy wage 
   And sing an honest song .... 
Not one like this -- for though I rue 
   The wrong of life, I flout it. 
Alas! I'm not prepared to do 
   A goddam thing about it.

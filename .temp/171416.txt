 
On the long shore, lit by the moon   
To show them properly alone,   
Two lovers suddenly embraced   
So that their shadows were as one.   
The ordinary night was graced 
For them by the swift tide of blood   
That silently they took at flood,   
And for a little time they prized 
   Themselves emparadised. 

Then, as if shaken by stage-fright   
Beneath the hard moon's bony light,   
They stood together on the sand   
Embarrassed in each other's sight   
But still conspiring hand in hand,   
Until they saw, there underfoot, 
As though the world had found them out,   
The goose fish turning up, though dead, 
   His hugely grinning head. 

There in the china light he lay,   
Most ancient and corrupt and grey.   
They hesitated at his smile, 
Wondering what it seemed to say 
To lovers who a little while 
Before had thought to understand,   
By violence upon the sand, 
The only way that could be known   
   To make a world their own. 

It was a wide and moony grin 
Together peaceful and obscene; 
They knew not what he would express,   
So finished a comedian 
He might mean failure or success,   
But took it for an emblem of 
Their sudden, new and guilty love 
To be observed by, when they kissed,   
   That rigid optimist. 

So he became their patriarch, 
Dreadfully mild in the half-dark. 
His throat that the sand seemed to choke,   
His picket teeth, these left their mark   
But never did explain the joke 
That so amused him, lying there 
While the moon went down to disappear   
Along the still and tilted track 
   That bears the zodiac.

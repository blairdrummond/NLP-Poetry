Let me thy Properties explain, 
A rotten Cabin, dropping Rain; 
Chimnies with Scorn rejecting Smoak; 
Stools, Tables, Chairs, and Bed-steds broke: 
Here Elements have lost their Vses, 
Air ripens not, nor Earth produces: 
In vain we make poor Sheelah toil, 
Fire will not roast, nor Water boil. 
Thro' all the Vallies, Hills, and Plains, 
The Goddess Want in Triumph reigns; 
And her chief Officers of State, 
Sloth, Dirt, and Theft around her wait.

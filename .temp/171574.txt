 
He comes here 
by whatever way he can,   
not too late, 
not too soon. 

He sits, waiting. 
He doesn't know   
why he should 
have such a patience. 

He sits at a table   
on a chair. 
He is comfortable   
sitting there. 

No one else 
in this room, 
no others, no expectations,   
no sounds. 

Had he walked   
another way, 
would he be here,   
like they say.

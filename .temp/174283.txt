 
Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;
         I am also call'd No-more, Too-late, Farewell;
         Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell
Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between;
Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
         Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell
         Is now a shaken shadow intolerable,
Of ultimate things unutter'd the frail screen.

Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart
         One moment through thy soul the soft surprise
         Of that wing'd Peace which lulls the breath of sighs,?
Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart
Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
         Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes.

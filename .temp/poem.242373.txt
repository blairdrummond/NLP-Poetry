Methinks 'tis pretty sport to hear a child,
 Rocking a word in mouth yet undefiled. 
 The tender racket rudely plays the sound,
 Which weakly banded cannot back rebound,
 And the soft air the softer roof does kiss,
 With a sweet dying and a pretty miss,
 Which hears no answer yet from the white rank
 Of teeth, not risen from their coral bank. 
 The alphabet is searched for letters soft,
 To try a word before it can be wrought,
 And when it slides forth, it goes as nice, 
 As when a man does walk upon the ice.

 
Sometime during eternity 
                                                       some guys show up   
and one of them 
                      who shows up real late 
                                                       is a kind of carpenter   
      from some square-type place 
                                              like Galilee 
          and he starts wailing 
                                          and claiming he is hip 
            to who made heaven 
                                       and earth 
                                                      and that the cat 
                   who really laid it on us 
                                                 is his Dad 

          And moreover 
             he adds 
                         It's all writ down 
                                              on some scroll-type parchments   
          which some henchmen 
                  leave lying around the Dead Sea somewheres   
                a long time ago 
                                       and which you won't even find   
         for a coupla thousand years or so 
                                                 or at least for 
      nineteen hundred and fortyseven 
                                                      of them 
                            to be exact 
                                             and even then 
         nobody really believes them 
                                                   or me 
                                                            for that matter 
          You're hot 
                         they tell him 
          And they cool him 

          They stretch him on the Tree to cool 

                         And everybody after that 
                                                               is always making models   
                                          of this Tree 
                                                          with Him hung up   
          and always crooning His name 
                                     and calling Him to come down   
                                 and sit in 
                                                 on their combo 
                           as if he is the king cat 
                                                            who's got to blow   
                      or they can't quite make it 

                      Only he don't come down 
                                                         from His Tree 
          Him just hang there 
                                       on His Tree 
          looking real Petered out 
                                          and real cool 
                                                             and also 
                   according to a roundup 
                                                    of late world news   
             from the usual unreliable sources 
                                                               real dead

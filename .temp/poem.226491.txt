I 

Swear by what the Sages spoke   
Round the Mareotic Lake 
That the Witch of Atlas knew,   
Spoke and set the cocks a-crow. 

Swear by those horsemen, by those women,   
Complexion and form prove superhuman,   
That pale, long visaged company 
That airs an immortality 
Completeness of their passions won;   
Now they ride the wintry dawn 
Where Ben Bulben sets the scene. 

Here's the gist of what they mean.   





Many times man lives and dies   
Between his two eternities,   
That of race and that of soul,   
And ancient Ireland knew it all.   
Whether man dies in his bed   
Or the rifle knocks him dead, 
A brief parting from those dear   
Is the worst man has to fear.   
Though grave-diggers' toil is long,   
Sharp their spades, their muscle strong,   
They but thrust their buried men   
Back in the human mind again. 





You that Mitchel's prayer have heard   
`Send war in our time, O Lord!'   
Know that when all words are said   
And a man is fighting mad,   
Something drops from eyes long blind   
He completes his partial mind,   
For an instant stands at ease,   
Laughs aloud, his heart at peace,   
Even the wisest man grows tense   
With some sort of violence   
Before he can accomplish fate   
Know his work or choose his mate. 





Poet and sculptor do the work   
Nor let the modish painter shirk   
What his great forefathers did,   
Bring the soul of man to God,   
Make him fill the cradles right. 

Measurement began our might:   
Forms a stark Egyptian thought,   
Forms that gentler Phidias wrought. 

Michael Angelo left a proof   
On the Sistine Chapel roof,   
Where but half-awakened Adam   
Can disturb globe-trotting Madam   
Till her bowels are in heat,   
Proof that there's a purpose set   
Before the secret working mind:   
Profane perfection of mankind. 

Quattrocento put in paint, 
On backgrounds for a God or Saint,   
Gardens where a soul's at ease;   
Where everything that meets the eye 
Flowers and grass and cloudless sky   
Resemble forms that are, or seem   
When sleepers wake and yet still dream,   
And when it's vanished still declare,   
With only bed and bedstead there,   
That Heavens had opened. 

                                        Gyres run on; 
When that greater dream had gone   
Calvert and Wilson, Blake and Claude   
Prepared a rest for the people of God,   
Palmer's phrase, but after that 
Confusion fell upon our thought. 





Irish poets learn your trade   
Sing whatever is well made,   
Scorn the sort now growing up   
All out of shape from toe to top, 
Their unremembering hearts and heads   
Base-born products of base beds.   
Sing the peasantry, and then   
Hard-riding country gentlemen,   
The holiness of monks, and after   
Porter-drinkers' randy laughter;   
Sing the lords and ladies gay   
That were beaten into the clay   
Through seven heroic centuries;   
Cast your mind on other days   
That we in coming days may be   
Still the indomitable Irishry. 





Under bare Ben Bulben's head 
In Drumcliff churchyard Yeats is laid,   
An ancestor was rector there 
Long years ago; a church stands near, 
By the road an ancient Cross. 
No marble, no conventional phrase,   
On limestone quarried near the spot   
By his command these words are cut: 

               Cast a cold eye   
               On life, on death.   
               Horseman, pass by!

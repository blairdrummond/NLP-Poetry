 
Atlas, you're Homer. I am so glad you're Hera.    
Thera so many things to tell you. I went on that    
minotaur of the museum. The new display centaurs    
on how you can contract Sisyphus if you don't use    
a Trojan on your Dictys. It was all Greek to me, see. 
When I was Roman around,    
I rubbed Midas against someone. "Medea, you look like a Goddess,"    
he said. The Minerva him! I told him to    
Frigg off, oracle the cops. "Loki here," I said.    
"In Odin times men had better manners." It's best to try    
and nymph that sort of thing in the bud. He said he knew    
Athena two about women like me, then tried to Bacchus    
into a corner. Dryads I could, he wouldn't stop.    
"Don't Troy with my affections," he said.    
"I'm already going to Helen a hand basket."    
I pretended to be completely Apollo by his behavior.    
If something like that Mars your day, it Styx with you    
forever. "I'm not Bragi," he said. "But Idon better."    
Some people will never Lerna. Juno what I did?    
Valhalla for help. I knew the police would    
Pegasus to the wall. The Sirens went off.    
Are you or Argonaut guilty, they asked.    
He told the cops he was Iliad bad clams.    
He said he accidentally Electra Cupid himself    
trying to adjust a lamp shade. This job has its    
pluses and Minos. The cops figured he was Fulla it.    
He nearly Runic for me. I'm telling you,    
it was quite an Odyssey, but I knew things would    
Pan out. And oh, by the way, here's all his gold.    
I was able to Fleece him before the museum closed.

Although I can see him still-- 
The freckled man who goes 
To a gray place on a hill 
In gray Connemara clothes 
At dawn to cast his flies-- 
It's long since I began 
To call up to the eyes 
This wise and simple man.   
All day I'd looked in the face   
What I had hoped it would be   
To write for my own race   
And the reality:   
The living men that I hate,   
The dead man that I loved,   
The craven man in his seat,   
The insolent unreproved-- 
And no knave brought to book   
Who has won a drunken cheer-- 
The witty man and his joke   
Aimed at the commonest ear,   
The clever man who cries   
The catch cries of the clown,   
The beating down of the wise   
And great Art beaten down. 

Maybe a twelve-month since 
Suddenly I began, 
In scorn of this audience, 
Imagining a man, 
And his sun-freckled face 
And gray Connemara cloth, 
Climbing up to a place 
Where stone is dark with froth, 
And the down turn of his wrist 
When the flies drop in the stream-- 
A man who does not exist,   
A man who is but a dream;   
And cried, "Before I am old   
I shall have written him one   
Poem maybe as cold   
And passionate as the dawn."

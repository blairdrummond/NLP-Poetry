 
For Reverend Theodore Richardson
If Mary came would Mary   
Forgive, as Mothers may,   
And sad and second Saviour   
Furnish us today? 

She would not shake her head and leave   
This military air, 
But ratify a modern hay, 
And put her Baby there. 

Mary would not punish men-- 
If Mary came again.

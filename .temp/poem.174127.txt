Come, my Lucasia, since we see
      That Miracles Mens faith do move,
By wonder and by prodigy
      To the dull angry world let's prove
      There's a Religion in our Love.





For though we were design'd t' agree,
      That Fate no liberty destroyes,
But our Election is as free
      As Angels, who with greedy choice
      Are yet determin'd to their joyes.





Our hearts are doubled by the loss,
      Here Mixture is Addition grown ;
We both diffuse, and both ingross :
      And we whose minds are so much one,
      Never, yet ever are alone.





We court our own Captivity
      Than Thrones more great and innocent :
'Twere banishment to be set free,
      Since we wear fetters whose intent
      Not Bondage is, but Ornament.





Divided joyes are tedious found,
      And griefs united easier grow :
We are our selves but by rebound,
      And all our Titles shuffled so,
      Both Princes, and both Subjects too.





Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid,
      While they (such power in Friendship lies)
Are Altars, Priests, and Off'rings made :
      And each Heart which thus kindly dies,
      Grows deathless by the Sacrifice.

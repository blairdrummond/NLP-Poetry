 
When descends on the Atlantic 
      The gigantic 
Storm-wind of the equinox, 
Landward in his wrath he scourges 
      The toiling surges, 
Laden with seaweed from the rocks: 

From Bermuda's reefs; from edges 
      Of sunken ledges, 
In some far-off, bright Azore; 
From Bahama, and the dashing, 
      Silver-flashing 
Surges of San Salvador; 

From the tumbling surf, that buries 
      The Orkneyan skerries, 
Answering the hoarse Hebrides; 
And from wrecks of ships, and drifting 
      Spars, uplifting 
On the desolate, rainy seas; -- 

Ever drifting, drifting, drifting 
      On the shifting 
Currents of the restless main; 
Till in sheltered coves, and reaches 
      Of sandy beaches, 
All have found repose again. 

So when storms of wild emotion 
      Strike the ocean 
Of the poet's soul, erelong 
From each cave and rocky fastness, 
      In its vastness, 
Floats some fragment of a song: 

From the far-off isles enchanted, 
      Heaven has planted 
With the golden fruit of Truth; 
From the flashing surf, whose vision 
      Gleams Elysian 
In the tropic clime of Youth; 

From the strong Will, and the Endeavor 
      That forever 
Wrestle with the tides of Fate; 
From the wreck of Hopes far-scattered, 
      Tempest-shattered, 
Floating waste and desolate; -- 

Ever drifting, drifting, drifting 
      On the shifting 
Currents of the restless heart; 
Till at length in books recorded, 
      They, like hoarded 
Household words, no more depart.

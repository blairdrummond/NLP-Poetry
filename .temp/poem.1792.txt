Watching the still pool and the reeds   

And the dark clouds   

Which the wind of the upper air   

Tore like the green leafy boughs   

Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;   

But though I greatly delight   

In these and the water-lilies,   

That which sets me nighest to weeping   

Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,   

And the pale yellow grasses   

Among them.

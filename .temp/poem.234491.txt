Love, thou art best of Human Joys,
    Our chiefest Happiness below;
All other Pleasures are but Toys,
Musick without Thee is but Noise,
       And Beauty but an empty show.

Heav'n , who knew best what Man wou'd move,
    And raise his Thoughts above the Brute;
Said, Let him Be, and Let him Love;
That must alone his Soul improve,
       Howe'er Philosophers dispute.

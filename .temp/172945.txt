 
She has attained the permanence 
She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning. 
Untended stalks blow over her 
Even and swift, like young men running. 

Always in the heart she loved 
Others had lived,--she heard their laughter. 
She lies where none has lain before, 
Where certainly none will follow after.

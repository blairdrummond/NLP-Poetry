I looked up from my writing, 
   And gave a start to see, 
As if rapt in my inditing, 
   The moon's full gaze on me. 

Her meditative misty head 
   Was spectral in its air, 
And I involuntarily said, 
   'What are you doing there?' 

'Oh, I've been scanning pond and hole 
   And waterway hereabout 
For the body of one with a sunken soul 
   Who has put his life-light out. 

'Did you hear his frenzied tattle? 
   It was sorrow for his son 
Who is slain in brutish battle, 
   Though he has injured none. 

'And now I am curious to look 
   Into the blinkered mind 
Of one who wants to write a book 
   In a world of such a kind.' 

Her temper overwrought me, 
   And I edged to shun her view, 
For I felt assured she thought me 
   One who should drown him too.

 
Oh, but to fade, and live we know not where, 
To be a cold obstruction and to groan! 
This sensible, warm woman to become 
A prudish clod; and the delighted spirit 
To live and die alone, or to reside 
With married sisters, and to have the care 
Of half a dozen children, not your own; 
And driven, for no one wants you, 
Round the pendant world; or worse than worse 
Of those that disappointment and pure spite 
Have driven to madness: 'Tis too horrible! 
The weariest and most troubled married life 
That age, ache, penury, or jealousy 
Can lay on nature, is a paradise 
To being an old maid.

I'm herdsman of a flock. 
The sheep are my thoughts 
And my thoughts are all sensations. 
I think with my eyes and my ears 
And my hands and feet 
And nostrils and mouth. 

To think a flower is to see and smell it. 
To eat a fruit is to sense its savor. 

And that is why, when I feel sad, 
In a day of heat, because of so much joy 
And lay me down in the grass to rest 
And close my sun-warmed eyes, 
I feel my whole body relaxed in reality 
And know the whole truth and am happy.

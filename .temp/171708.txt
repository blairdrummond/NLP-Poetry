 
The unicorn is an easy prey: its horn 
in the maiden's lap is an obvious 
twist, a tamed figure--like the hawk 
that once roamed free, but sits now, fat and hooded,   
squawking on the hunter's wrist. It's easy   
to catch what no longer captures 
the mind, long since woven in, 
a faded tapestry on a crumbling wall 
made by the women who wore keys 
at their waists and in their sleep came 
hot dreams of wounded knights left bleeding 
in their care, who would wake the next morning   
groaning from the leftover lance in the groin,   
look up into the round blond face beaming down   
at them thinking "mine," and say: "angel."   
Such beasts are easy to catch; their dreams   
betray them. But the hard prey is the one   
that won't come bidden. 

By these signs you will know it: 
when you lift your lure 
out of the water, the long plastic line 
will be missing its end: the lure and the hook   
will be gone, and the line will swing free   
in the air, so light it will be without 
bait or its cunning 
sharp curl of silver. Or when you pull 
your net from the stream, it will be eaten   
as if by acid, its fine mesh sodden shreds. 

Or when you go at dawn to check your traps,   
their great metal jaws will be wrenched 
open, the teeth blunt with rust 
as if they had lain for years in the rain. 
Or when the thunderstorm suddenly breaks   
in the summer, next morning 
the computer's memory will be blank. 

Look then for the blank card, the sprung trap,   
the net's dissolve, the unburdened   
line that swings free in the air. 
There. By day, go empty-handed to the hunt   
and come home the same way   
in the dark.

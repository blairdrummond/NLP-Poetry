 
Although most are totally naked   
and too scant for even the slightest    
color and although they have no voice    
that I've ever heard for cry or song, they are,    
nevertheless, more than mirage, more    
than hallucination, more than falsehood.   

They have confronted sulfuric    
boiling black sea bottoms and stayed,      
held on under ten tons of polar ice,    
established themselves in dense salts    
and acids, survived eating metal ions.    
They are more committed than oblivion,    
more prolific than stars.   

Far too ancient for scripture, each   
one bears in its one cell one text--   
the first whit of alpha, the first    
jot of bearing, beneath the riling    
sun the first nourishing of self.      

Too lavish for saints, too trifling    
for baptism, they have existed    
throughout never gaining girth enough    
to hold a firm hope of salvation.   
Too meager in heart for compassion,   
too lean for tears, less in substance   
than sacrifice, not one has ever    
carried a cross anywhere.   

And not one of their trillions    
has ever been given a tombstone.    
I've never noticed a lessening    
of light in the ceasing of any one    
of them. They are more mutable    
than mere breathing and vanishing,    
more mysterious than resurrection,    
too minimal for death.

 
My mother weeping 
in the dark hallway, in the arms of a man, 
not my father, 
as I sat at the top of the stairs unnoticed-- 
my mother weeping and pleading for what I didn't know 
then and can still only imagine-- 
for things to be somehow other than they were, 
not knowing what I would change, 
for, or to, or why, 
only that my mother was weeping 
in the arms of a man not me, 
and the rain brought down the winter sky 
and hid me in the walls that looked on, 
indifferent to my mother's weeping, 
or mine, 
in the rain that brought down the dark afternoon.

 
The man moves earth   
to dispel grief. 
He digs holes 
the size of cars. 
In proportion to what is taken   
what is given multiplies-- 
rain-swollen ponds 
and dirt mounds 
rooted with flame-tipped flowers. 
He carries trees like children   
struggling to be set down.   
Trees that have lived 
out their lives, 
he cuts and stacks 
like loaves of bread 
which he will feed the fire.   
The green smoke sweetens   
his house. 

The woman sweeps air 
to banish sadness.   
She dusts floors,   
polishes objects 
made of clay and wood. 
In proportion to what is taken 
what is given multiplies-- 
the task of something   
else to clean. 
Gleaming appliances   
beg to be smudged, 
breathed upon by small children 
and large animals   
flicking out hope   
as she whirls by,   
flap of tongue, 
scratch of paw, 
sweetly reminding her. 

The man moves earth,   
the woman sweeps air.   
Together they pull water   
out of the other, 
pull with the muscular   
ache of the living, 
hauling from the deep   
well of the body 
the rain-swollen, 
the flame-tipped, 
the milk-fed-- 
all that cycles 
through lives moving,   
lives sweeping, water   
circulating between them   
like breath, 
drawn out of leaves by light.

 
If you press a stone with your finger, 
Sir Isaac Newton observed, 
The finger is also 
Pressed by the stone. 
But can a woman, pressed by memory's finger, 
In the deep night, alone, 
Of her softness move 
The airy thing 
That presses upon her 
With the whole weight of love? This 
Sir Isaac said nothing of.

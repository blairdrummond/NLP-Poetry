If no one ever marries me,-- 
And I don't see why they should, 
For nurse says I'm not pretty, 
And I'm seldom very good--

If no one ever marries me 
I shan't mind very much; 
I shall buy a squirrel in a cage, 
And a little rabbit-hutch:

I shall have a cottage near a wood, 
And a pony all my own, 
And a little lamb quite clean and tame, 
That I can take to town:

And when I'm getting really old,-- 
At twenty-eight or nine-- 
I shall buy a little orphan-girl 
And bring her up as mine.

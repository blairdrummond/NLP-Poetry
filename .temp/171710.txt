 
Whose woods these are I think I know ...
The landings had gone wrong; white silk,   
like shrouds, covered the woods. 
The trees had trapped the flimsy fabric 
in their web--everywhere the harnessed bodies   
hung--helpless, treading air 
like water. 
                  We thought to float down 
easily--a simple thing 
like coming home: feet first, 
a welcome from the waiting fields, 
a gentle fall in clover. 

We hadn't counted on this 
wilderness, the gusts of wind 
that took us over; we were surprised   
by the tenacity of branching wood,   
its reach, and how impenetrable 
the place we left, and thought we knew,   
could be. 
               Sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling   
pendulums that mark the time,   
we still can dream 
someone will come and cut us down.   
There is nothing here but words, the calls   
we try the dark with--hoping for a human   
ear, response, a rescue party. 
But all we hear is other 
voices like our own, other bodies   
tangled in the lines, 
the repetition of a cry from every tree: 

I can't help you, help me.

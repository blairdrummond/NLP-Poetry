 
I love the way the black ants use their dead. 
They carry them off like warriors on their steel 
backs. They spend hours struggling, lifting, 
dragging (it is not grisly as it would be for us, 
to carry them back to be eaten), 
so that every part will be of service. I think of 
my husband at his father's grave-- 
the grass had closed 
over the headstone, and the name had disappeared. He took out   
his pocket knife and cut the grass away, he swept it 
with his handkerchief to make it clear. "Is this the way 
we'll be forgotten?" And he bent down over the grave and wept.

As if the flow of the waters
From the triple streams of heavenly showers 
So the sacred Ao of the eighth heavens
Whose flames have scorched the land. 

      Chorus: 
      Should our hearts' love be restored 
      And our rights be ours once more 
      Then will our sacred beloved shoals of Kane 
      Be the firm foundation of the land. 

The heavens expand and bestow 
Her beauteous crownlets free 
Its life to her people for offerings given 
And from loyal hearts ascended prayers. 

Cold words and looks reprove 
Oh, turn not thus away 
Give kindly greetings, words of love 
And a heart which beats within.

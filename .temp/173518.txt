 
De Camptown ladies sing dis song--Doo-dah! doo-dah! 
De Camp-town race-track five miles long--Oh! doo-dah day! 
I come down dah wid my hat caved in--Doo-dah! doo-dah! 
I go back home wid a pocket full of tin--Oh! doo-dah day!

Gwine to run all day! 
I'll bet my money on de bob-tail nag-- 
Somebody bet on de bay. 

De long tail filly and de big black hoss--Doo-dah! doo-dah! 
Dey fly de track and dey both cut across--Oh! doo-dah-day! 
De blind hoss sticken in a big mud hole--Doo-dah! doo-dah! 
Can't touch bottom wid a ten foot pole--Oh! doo-dah-day!

Somebody bet on de bay.

 
When the forests have been destroyed their darkness remains   
The ash the great walker follows the possessors 
Forever 
Nothing they will come to is real 
Nor for long 
Over the watercourses 
Like ducks in the time of the ducks 
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky 
Making a new twilight 

Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead   
Again again with its pointless sound 
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything 

The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed   
The dead go away like bruises 
The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands   
Pain the horizon 
Remains 
Overhead the seasons rock 
They are paper bells 
Calling to nothing living 

The possessors move everywhere under Death their star   
Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows   
Like thin flames with no light 
They with no past 
And fire their only future

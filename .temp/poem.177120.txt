This World is not Conclusion. 
A Species stands beyond-- 
Invisible, as Music-- 
But positive, as Sound-- 
It beckons, and it baffles-- 
Philosophy--don't know-- 
And through a Riddle, at the last-- 
Sagacity, must go-- 
To guess it, puzzles scholars-- 
To gain it, Men have borne 
Contempt of Generations 
And Crucifixion, shown-- 
Faith slips--and laughs, and rallies-- 
Blushes, if any see-- 
Plucks at a twig of Evidence-- 
And asks a Vane, the way-- 
Much Gesture, from the Pulpit-- 
Strong Hallelujahs roll-- 
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth 
That nibbles at the soul--

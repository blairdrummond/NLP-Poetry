I'll not weep that thou art going to leave me, 
There's nothing lovely here; 
And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 
While thy heart suffers there. 

I'll not weep, because the summer's glory 
Must always end in gloom; 
And, follow out the happiest story-- 
It closes with a tomb! 

And I am weary of the anguish 
Increasing winters bear; 
Weary to watch the spirit languish 
Through years of dead despair. 

So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 
Should haply fall from me, 
It is but that my soul is sighing, 
To go and rest with thee.

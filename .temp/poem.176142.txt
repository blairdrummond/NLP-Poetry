All night I dreamed of roses,   
   Wild tangle by the sea,   
And shadowy garden closes.   
   Dream-led I met with thee. 

Around thee swayed the roses, 
   Beyond thee sang the sea; 
The shadowy garden closes   
   Were Paradise to me. 

O Love, 'mid the dream-roses   
   Abide to heal, to save! 
The world that day discloses   
   Narrows to one white grave.

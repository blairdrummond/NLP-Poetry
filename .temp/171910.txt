 
Every city in America is approached 
through a work of art, usually a bridge 
but sometimes a road that curves underneath 
or drops down from the sky. Pittsburgh has a tunnel-- 

you don't know it--that takes you through the rivers   
and under the burning hills. I went there to cry   
in the woods or carry my heavy bicycle 
through fire and flood. Some have little parks-- 

San Francisco has a park. Albuquerque   
is beautiful from a distance; it is purple 
at five in the evening. New York is Egyptian,   
especially from the little rise on the hill 

at 14-C; it has twelve entrances 
like the body of Jesus, and Easton, where I lived,   
has two small floating bridges in front of it   
that brought me in and out. I said good-bye 

to them both when I was 57. I'm reading 
Joseph Wood Krutch again--the second time. 
I love how he lived in the desert. I'm looking at the skull   
of Georgia O'Keeffe. I'm kissing Stieglitz good-bye. 

He was a city, Stieglitz was truly a city 
in every sense of the word; he wore a library   
across his chest; he had a church on his knees.   
I'm kissing him good-bye; he was, for me, 

the last true city; after him there were   
only overpasses and shopping centers,   
little enclaves here and there, a skyscraper   
with nothing near it, maybe a meaningless turf 

where whores couldn't even walk, where nobody sits,   
where nobody either lies or runs; either that   
or some pure desert: a lizard under a boojum,   
a flower sucking the water out of a rock. 

What is the life of sadness worth, the bookstores   
lost, the drugstores buried, a man with a stick   
turning the bricks up, numbering the shards,   
dream twenty-one, dream twenty-two. I left 

with a glass of tears, a little artistic vial. 
I put it in my leather pockets next 
to my flask of Scotch, my golden knife and my keys,   
my joyful poems and my T-shirts. Stieglitz is there 

beside his famous number; there is smoke 
and fire above his head; some bowlegged painter   
is whispering in his ear; some lady-in-waiting   
is taking down his words. I'm kissing Stieglitz 

good-bye, my arms are wrapped around him, his photos   
are making me cry; we're walking down Fifth Avenue;   
we're looking for a pencil; there is a girl 
standing against the wall--I'm shaking now 

when I think of her; there are two buildings, one   
is in blackness, there is a dying poplar; 
there is a light on the meadow; there is a man 
on a sagging porch. I would have believed in everything.

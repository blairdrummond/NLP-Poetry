Now like the Lady of Shalott, 
   I dwell within an empty room, 
And through the day and through the night 
   I sit before an ancient loom. 

And like the Lady of Shalott 
   I look into a mirror wide, 
Where shadows come, and shadows go, 
   And ply my shuttle as they glide. 

Not as she wove the yellow wool, 
   Ulysses' wife, Penelope; 
By day a queen among her maids, 
   But in the night a woman, she, 

Who, creeping from her lonely couch, 
   Unraveled all the slender woof; 
Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers, 
   To fire the fagots on the roof! 

But weaving with a steady hand 
   The shadows, whether false or true, 
I put aside a doubt which asks 
   'Among these phantoms what are you?' 

For not with altar, tomb, or urn, 
   Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield, 
Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars, 
   Or banquet in the tented field; 

Or Norman knight in armor clad, 
   Waiting a foe where four roads meet; 
Or hawk and hound in bosky dell, 
   Where dame and page in secret greet; 

Or rose and lily, bud and flower, 
   My web is broidered. Nothing bright 
Is woven here: the shadows grow 
   Still darker in the mirror's light! 

And as my web grows darker too, 
   Accursed seems this empty room; 
For still I must forever weave 
   These phantoms by this ancient loom.

Once there came a man 
Who said:   
"Range me all men of the world in rows." 
And instantly   
There was a terrific clamor among the people 
Against being ranged in rows. 
There was a loud quarrel, world-wide. 
It endured for ages; 
And blood was shed 
By those who would not stand in rows, 
And by those who pined to stand in rows. 
Eventually, the man went to death, weeping. 
And those who stayed in the bloody scuffle 
Knew not the great simplicity.

There is a Smile of Love 
And there is a Smile of Deceit 
And there is a Smile of Smiles 
In which these two Smiles meet 

And there is a Frown of Hate 
And there is a Frown of disdain 
And there is a Frown of Frowns 
Which you strive to forget in vain 

For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core 
And it sticks in the deep Back bone 
And no Smile that ever was smild 
But only one Smile alone 

That betwixt the Cradle & Grave 
It only once Smild can be 
But when it once is Smild 
Theres an end to all Misery

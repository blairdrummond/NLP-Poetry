 
Strong ankled, sun burned, almost naked, 
The daughters of California   
Educate reluctant humanists; 
Drive into their skulls with tennis balls 
The unhappy realization 
That nature is still stronger than man. 
The special Hellenic privilege   
Of the special intellect seeps out   
At last in this irrigated soil. 
Sweat of athletes and juice of lovers 
Are stronger than Socrates' hemlock; 
And the games of scrupulous Euclid 
Vanish in the gymnopaedia.

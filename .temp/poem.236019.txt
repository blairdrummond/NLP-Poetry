Yes, nonsense is a treasure!
   I love it from my heart; 
The only earthly pleasure 
   That never will depart. 

But, as for stupid reason, 
    That stalking, ten-foot rule, 
She's always out of season, 
    A tedious, testy fool. 

She's like a walking steeple, 
    With a clock for face and eyes, 
Still bawling to all people, 
   Time bids us to be wise. 

While nonsense on the spire 
    A weathercock you'll find, 
Than reason soaring higher, 
    And changing with the wind. 

The clock too oft deceives, 
    Says what it cannot prove; 
While every one believes 
    The vane that turns above. 

Reason oft speaks unbidden, 
    And chides us to our face; 
For which she should be chidden, 
    And taught to know her place. 

While nonsense smiles and chatters, 
    And says such charming things, 
Like youthful hope she flatters; 
    And like a syren sings. 

Her charm's from fancy borrowed, 
    For she is fancy's pet; 
Her name is on her forehead, 
    In rainbow colors set. 

Then, nonsense let us cherish, 
    Far, far from reason's light; 
Lest in her light she perish, 
   And vanish from our sight.

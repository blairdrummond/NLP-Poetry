Last night rain fell over the scarred plateau 
And now from the dark horizon, dazzling, flies 
Arrow on fire-plumed arrow to the skies 
Shot from the bright arc of Apollo's bow; 
And from the wild and writhen waste below,
 From flashing pools and mounds lit one by one,
 O is it mist or are these companies 
Of morning heroes who arise, arise 
With thrusting arms, with limbs and hair aglow 
Toward the risen god, upon whose brow
 Burns the gold laurel of all victories, 
Hero and hero's god, th' invincible Sun?

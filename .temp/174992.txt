 
There's a certain Slant of light, 
Winter Afternoons - 
That oppresses, like the Heft 
Of Cathedral Tunes - 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us - 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference - 
Where the Meanings, are - 

None may teach it - Any - 
'Tis the seal Despair - 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the Air - 

When it comes, the Landscape listens - 
Shadows - hold their breath - 
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death -

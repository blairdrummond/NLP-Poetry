Exert thy voice, sweet harbinger of spring! 
    This moment is thy time to sing, 
    This moment I attend to praise, 
And set my numbers to they lays. 
    Free as thine shall be my song; 
    As they music, short, or long. 
Poets, wild as thee, were born, 
    Pleasing best when unconfined, 
    When to please is least designed, 
Soothing but their cares to rest; 
    Cares do still their thoughts molest, 
    And still th' unhappy poet's breast, 
Like thine, when best he sings, is placed against a thorn. 
She begins, Let all be still! 
    Muse, they promise now fulfill! 
Sweet, oh! sweet, still sweeter yet 
Can thy words such accents fit, 
Canst thou syllables refine, 
Melt a sense that shall retain 
Still some spirit of the brain, 
Till with sounds like these it join. 
    'Twill not be! then change thy note; 
    Let division shake thy throat. 
Hark! Division now she tries; 
Yet as far the Muse outflies. 
    Cease then, prithee, cease thy tune; 
    Trifler, wilt thou sing till *June*? 
Till thy business all lies waste, 
And the time of building's past! 
    Thus we poets that have speech,                                              
Unlike what they forests teach, 
    If a fluent vein be shown 
    That's transcendant to our own, 
Criticize, reform, or preach, 
Or censure what we cannot reach.

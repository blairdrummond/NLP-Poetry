 
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
   Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
   Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
   Till I can see so wide, 
Rivers and trees and cattle and all 
   Over the countryside-- 

Till I look down on the garden green, 
   Down on the roof so brown-- 
Up in the air I go flying again, 
   Up in the air and down!

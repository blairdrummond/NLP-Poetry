 
Green groweth the holly, 
So doth the ivy. 
Though winter blasts blow never so high, 
Green groweth the holly. 

As the holly groweth green 
And never changeth hue, 
So I am, ever hath been, 
Unto my lady true. 

As the holly groweth green 
With ivy all alone 
When flowers cannot be seen 
And greenwood leaves be gone, 

Now unto my lady 
Promise to her I make, 
From all other only 
To her I me betake. 

Adieu, mine own lady, 
Adieu, my special 
Who hath my heart truly 
Be sure, and ever shall.

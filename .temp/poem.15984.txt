1. 
Of the gardens of Adonis, Lydia, I love 
Most of all those fugitive roses 
         That on the day they are born, 
         That very day, must also die. 
Eternal, for them, the light of day: 
They're born when the sun is already high 
         And die before Apollo's course

         Across the visible sky is run. 
We too, of our lives, must make one day: 
We never know, my Lydia, nor want 
        To know of nights before or after 
        The little while that we may last. 
2. 
To be great, be whole: nothing that's you 
         Should you exaggerate or exclude. 
In each thing, be all. Give all you are 
         In the least you ever do. 
The whole moon, because it rides so high, 
         Is reflected in each pool.

Though beauty be the mark of praise, 
   And yours of whom I sing be such 
   As not the world can praise too much, 
Yet 'tis your virtue now I raise. 

A virtue, like allay, so gone 
   Throughout your form, as, though that move 
   And draw and conquer all men's love, 
This subjects you to love of one. 

Wherein you triumph yet; because 
   'Tis of yourself, and that you use 
   The noblest freedom, not to choose 
Against or faith or honor's laws. 

But who should less expect from you, 
   In whom alone Love lives again? 
   By whom he is restored to men, 
And kept, and bred, and brought up true. 

His falling temples you have reared, 
   The withered garlands ta'en away; 
   His altars kept from the decay 
That envy wished, and nature feared; 

And on them burn so chaste a flame, 
   With so much loyalties' expense, 
   As Love, t' acquit such excellence, 
Is gone himself into your name. 

And you are he; the deity 
   To whom all lovers are designed 
   That would their better objects find; 
Among which faithful troop am I. 

Who, as an offspring at your shrine, 
   Have sung this hymn, and here entreat 
   One spark of your diviner heat 
To light upon a love of mine. 

Which, if it kindle not, but scant 
   Appear, and that to shortest view, 
   Yet give me leave t' adore in you 
What I in her am grieved to want.

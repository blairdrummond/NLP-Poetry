 
Each morning I made my way   
among gangways, elevators,   
and nurses' pods to Jane's room   
to interrogate the grave helpers   
who tended her through the night   
while the ship's massive engines   
kept its propellers turning. 
Week after week, I sat by her bed   
with black coffee and the Globe.   
The passengers on this voyage   
wore masks or cannulae 
or dangled devices that dripped   
chemicals into their wrists.   
I believed that the ship 
traveled to a harbor 
of breakfast, work, and love.   
I wrote: "When the infusions   
are infused entirely, bone 
marrow restored and lymphoblasts   
remitted, I will take my wife,   
bald as Michael Jordan, 
back to our dog and day." Today,   
months later at home, these   
words turned up on my desk   
as I listened in case Jane called   
for help, or spoke in delirium,   
ready to make the agitated 
drive to Emergency again 
for readmission to the huge 
vessel that heaves water month   
after month, without leaving   
port, without moving a knot,   
without arrival or destination,   
its great engines pounding.

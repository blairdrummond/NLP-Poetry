"How does the water
  Come down at Lodore?"
  My little boy asked me
  Thus, once on a time;
  And moreover he tasked me
  To tell him in rhyme.
  Anon, at the word,
  There first came one daughter,
  And then came another,
  To second and third
  The request of their brother,
  And to hear how the water
  Comes down at Lodore,
  With its rush and its roar,
  As many a time
  They had seen it before.
  So I told them in rhyme,
  For of rhymes I had store;
  And 'twas in my vocation
  For their recreation
  That so I should sing;
  Because I was Laureate
  To them and the King.


  From its sources which well
  In the tarn on the fell;
  From its fountains
  In the mountains,
  Its rills and its gills;
  Through moss and through brake,
  It runs and it creeps
  For a while, till it sleeps
  In its own little lake.
  And thence at departing,
  Awakening and starting,
  It runs through the reeds,
  And away it proceeds,
  Through meadow and glade,
  In sun and in shade,
  And through the wood-shelter,
  Among crags in its flurry,
  Helter-skelter,
  Hurry-skurry.
  Here it comes sparkling,
  And there it lies darkling;
  Now smoking and frothing
  Its tumult and wrath in,
  Till, in this rapid race
  On which it is bent,
  It reaches the place
  Of its steep descent.


  The cataract strong
  Then plunges along,
  Striking and raging


  As if a war raging
  Its caverns and rocks among;
  Rising and leaping,
  Sinking and creeping,
  Swelling and sweeping,
  Showering and springing,
  Flying and flinging,
  Writhing and ringing,
  Eddying and whisking,
  Spouting and frisking,
  Turning and twisting,
  Around and around
  With endless rebound:
  Smiting and fighting,
  A sight to delight in;
  Confounding, astounding,
  Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound.


  Collecting, projecting,
  Receding and speeding,
  And shocking and rocking,
  And darting and parting,
  And threading and spreading,
  And whizzing and hissing,
  And dripping and skipping,
  And hitting and splitting,
  And shining and twining,
  And rattling and battling,
  And shaking and quaking,
  And pouring and roaring,
  And waving and raving,
  And tossing and crossing,
  And flowing and going,
  And running and stunning,
  And foaming and roaming,
  And dinning and spinning,
  And dropping and hopping,
  And working and jerking,
  And guggling and struggling,
  And heaving and cleaving,
  And moaning and groaning;


  And glittering and frittering,
  And gathering and feathering,
  And whitening and brightening,
  And quivering and shivering,
  And hurrying and skurrying,
  And thundering and floundering;


  Dividing and gliding and sliding,
  And falling and brawling and sprawling,
  And driving and riving and striving,
  And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling,
  And sounding and bounding and rounding,
  And bubbling and troubling and doubling,
  And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling,
  And clattering and battering and shattering;


  Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,
  Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,
  Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing,
  Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling,
  And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming,
  And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing,
  And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping,
  And curling and whirling and purling and twirling,
  And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,
  And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;
  And so never ending, but always descending,
  Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending
  All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar, -
  And this way the water comes down at Lodore.

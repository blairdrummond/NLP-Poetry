I have met them at close of day   
Coming with vivid faces 
From counter or desk among grey   
Eighteenth-century houses. 
I have passed with a nod of the head   
Or polite meaningless words,   
Or have lingered awhile and said   
Polite meaningless words, 
And thought before I had done   
Of a mocking tale or a gibe   
To please a companion 
Around the fire at the club,   
Being certain that they and I   
But lived where motley is worn:   
All changed, changed utterly:   
A terrible beauty is born. 

That woman's days were spent   
In ignorant good-will, 
Her nights in argument 
Until her voice grew shrill. 
What voice more sweet than hers   
When, young and beautiful,   
She rode to harriers? 
This man had kept a school   
And rode our winged horse;   
This other his helper and friend   
Was coming into his force; 
He might have won fame in the end,   
So sensitive his nature seemed,   
So daring and sweet his thought. 
 This other man I had dreamed 
A drunken, vainglorious lout. 
He had done most bitter wrong 
To some who are near my heart,   
Yet I number him in the song; 
He, too, has resigned his part 
In the casual comedy; 
He, too, has been changed in his turn,   
Transformed utterly: 
A terrible beauty is born. 

Hearts with one purpose alone   
Through summer and winter seem   
Enchanted to a stone 
To trouble the living stream. 
The horse that comes from the road,   
The rider, the birds that range   
From cloud to tumbling cloud,   
Minute by minute they change;   
A shadow of cloud on the stream   
Changes minute by minute;   
A horse-hoof slides on the brim,   
And a horse plashes within it;   
The long-legged moor-hens dive,   
And hens to moor-cocks call;   
Minute by minute they live:   
The stone's in the midst of all. 

Too long a sacrifice 
Can make a stone of the heart.   
O when may it suffice? 
That is Heaven's part, our part   
To murmur name upon name,   
As a mother names her child   
When sleep at last has come   
On limbs that had run wild.   
What is it but nightfall? 
No, no, not night but death;   
Was it needless death after all? 
 For England may keep faith   
For all that is done and said.   
We know their dream; enough 
To know they dreamed and are dead;   
And what if excess of love   
Bewildered them till they died?   
I write it out in a verse-- 
MacDonagh and MacBride   
And Connolly and Pearse 
Now and in time to be, 
Wherever green is worn, 
Are changed, changed utterly:   
A terrible beauty is born.

 
Flesh, and cars, tar, dug holes beneath stone 
a rude hierarchy of money, band saws cross out   
music, feeling. Even speech, corrodes. 
                                                          I came here 
from where I sat boiling in my veins, cold fear   
at the death of men, the death of learning, in 
cold fear, at my own. Romantic vests of same death   
blank at the corner, blank when they raise their fingers 

Criss the hearts, in dark flesh staggered so marvelous   
are their lies. So complete, their mastery, of these   
stupid niggers. Loud spics kill each other, and will not 

make the simple trip to Tiffany's. Will not smash their stainless   
heads, against the simpler effrontery of so callous a code as gain. 

You are no brothers, dirty woogies, dying under dried rinds, in massa's   
droopy tuxedos. Cab Calloways of the soul, at the soul's juncture, a   
music, they think will save them from our eyes. (In back of the terminal 

where the circus will not go. At the backs of crowds, stooped and vulgar   
breathing hate syllables, unintelligible rapes of all that linger in   
our new world. Killed in white fedora hats, they stand so mute at what 

whiter slaves did to my father. They muster silence. They pray at the   
steps of abstract prisons, to be kings, when all is silence, when all 
is stone. When even the stupid fruit of their loins is gold, or something   
else they cannot eat.

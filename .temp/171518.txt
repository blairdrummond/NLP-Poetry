 
Sorting out letters and piles of my old 
    Canceled checks, old clippings, and yellow note cards   
That meant something once, I happened to find 
    Your picture. That picture. I stopped there cold,   
Like a man raking piles of dead leaves in his yard 
             Who has turned up a severed hand. 

Still, that first second, I was glad: you stand 
    Just as you stood--shy, delicate, slender, 
In that long gown of green lace netting and daisies 
    That you wore to our first dance. The sight of you stunned   
Us all. Well, our needs were different, then, 
             And our ideals came easy. 

Then through the war and those two long years 
    Overseas, the Japanese dead in their shacks   
Among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes; I carried 
    This glimpse of you, there, to choke down my fear,   
Prove it had been, that it might come back. 
             That was before we got married. 

--Before we drained out one another's force   
    With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret 
And the sick eyes that blame; before the divorce 
    And the treachery. Say it: before we met. Still,   
I put back your picture. Someday, in due course, 
             I will find that it's still there.

 
I go separately 
The sweet knees of oxen have pressed a path for me   
ghosts with ingots have burned their bare hands   
it is the dungaree darkness with China stitched   
where the westerly winds 
and the traveler's checks 
the evensong of salesmen 
the glistening paraphernalia of twin suitcases   
where no one speaks English. 
I go separately 
It is the wind, the rubber wind 
when we brush our teeth in the way station   
a climate to beard. What forks these roads? 
Who clammers o'er the twain? 
What murmurs and rustles in the distance 
in the white branches where the light is whipped   
piercing at the crossing as into the dunes we simmer   
and toss ourselves awhile the motor pants like a forest   
where owls from their bandaged eyes send messages   
to the Indian couple. Peaks have you heard?   
I go separately 
We have reached the arithmetics, are partially quenched   
while it growls and hints in the lost trapper's voice   
She is coming toward us like a session of pines   
in the wild wooden air where rabbits are frozen,   
O mother of lakes and glaciers, save us gamblers   
whose wagon is perilously rapt.

Oh, Love, he went a-straying, 
A long time ago! 
I missed him in the Maying, 
When blossoms were of snow; 
So back I came by the old sweet way; 
And for I loved him so, wept that he came not with me, 
A long time ago! 
Wide open stood my chamber door, 
And one stepped forth to greet; 
Gray Grief, strange Grief, who turned me sore 
With words he spake so sweet. 
I gave him meat; I gave him drink; 
(And listened for Love's feet.) 
How many years? I cannot think; 
In truth, I do not know-- 
Ah, long time ago! 
Oh, love, he came not back again, 
Although I kept me fair; 
And each white May, in field and lane, 
I waited for him there! 
Yea, he forgot; but Grief stayed on, 
And in Love's empty chair 
Doth sit and tell of days long gone-- 
'Tis more than I can bear!

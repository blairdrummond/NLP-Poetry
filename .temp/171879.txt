 
Then it was the future, though what's arrived   
isn't what we had in mind, all chrome and   
cybernetics, when we set up exhibits 
in the cafeteria for the judges 
to review what we'd made of our hypotheses. 

The class skeptic (he later refused to sign   
anyone's yearbook, calling it a sentimental   
degradation of language) chloroformed mice,   
weighing the bodies before and after 
to catch the weight of the soul, 

wanting to prove the invisible 
real as a bagful of nails. A girl 
who knew it all made cookies from euglena, 
a one-celled compromise between animal and plant,   
she had cultured in a flask. 

We're smart enough, she concluded, 
to survive our mistakes, showing photos of farmland,   
poisoned, gouged, eroded. No one believed 
he really had built it when a kid no one knew   
showed up with an atom smasher, confirming that 

the tiniest particles could be changed   
into something even harder to break. 
And one whose mother had cancer (hard to admit now,   
it was me) distilled the tar of cigarettes   
to paint it on the backs of shaven mice. 

She wanted to know what it took, 
a little vial of sure malignancy, 
to prove a daily intake smaller 
than a single aspirin could finish 
something as large as a life. I thought of this 

because, today, the dusky seaside sparrow 
became extinct. It may never be as famous 
as the pterodactyl or the dodo, 
but the last one died today, a resident 
of Walt Disney World where now its tissue samples 

lie frozen, in case someday we learn to clone 
one from a few cells. Like those instant dinosaurs 
that come in a gelatin capsule--just add water   
and they inflate. One other thing this 
brings to mind. The euglena girl won first prize 

both for science and, I think, in retrospect, for hope.

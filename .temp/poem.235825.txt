What was it like, God of mine, what was it like? 
--Oh unfaithful heart, indecisive intelligence! 
Was it like the going by of the wind? 
Like the disappearance of the spring? 

As nimble, as changeable, as weightless 
as milkweed seeds in summer . . . Yes! Indefinite 
as a smile which is lost forever in a laugh . . . 
Arrogant in the air, just like a flag! 

   Flag, smile, milkweed pod, swift 
spring in June, clear wind! . . . 
Your celebration was so wild, so sad! 

   All of your changes ended up in nothing-- 
remembrance, a blind bee of bitter things!-- 
I don't know what you were like, but you were!

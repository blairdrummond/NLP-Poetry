 


The old watch: their 
thick eyes 
puff and foreclose by the moon. The young, heads   
trailed by the beginnings of necks, 
shiver, 
in the guarantee they shall be bodies. 

In the frog pond 
the vapor trail of a SAC bomber creeps, 

I hear its drone, drifting, high up   
in immaculate ozone. 


And I hear, 
coming over the hills, America singing, 
her varied carols I hear: 
crack of deputies' rifles practicing their aim on stray dogs at night,   
sput of cattleprod, 
TV going on about the smells of the human body, 
curses of the soldier as he poisons, burns, grinds, and stabs   
the rice of the world, 
with open mouth, crying strong, hysterical curses. 


And by paddies in Asia 
bones 
wearing a few shadows 
walk down a dirt road, smashed   
bloodsuckers on their heel, knowing   
flesh thrown down in the sunshine   
dogs shall eat 
and flesh flung into the air 
shall be seized by birds, 
shoulder blades smooth, unmarked by old feather-holes,   
hands rivered 
by blue, erratic wanderings of the blood,   
eyes crinkled shut at almost seeing   
the drifting sun that gives us our lives.

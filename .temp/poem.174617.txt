Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again, 
         So loud with voices of the birds, 
         So thick with lowings of the herds, 
Day, when I lost the flower of men; 

Who tremblest thro' thy darkling red 
         On yon swoll'n brook that bubbles fast 
         By meadows breathing of the past, 
And woodlands holy to the dead; 

Who murmurest in the foliaged eaves 
         A song that slights the coming care, 
         And Autumn laying here and there 
A fiery finger on the leaves; 

Who wakenest with thy balmy breath 
         To myriads on the genial earth, 
         Memories of bridal, or of birth, 
And unto myriads more, of death. 

O wheresoever those may be, 
         Betwixt the slumber of the poles, 
         To-day they count as kindred souls; 
They know me not, but mourn with me.

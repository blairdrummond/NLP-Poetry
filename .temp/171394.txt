 
The two boys lean out on the railing   
of the front porch, looking up. 
Behind them they can hear their mother   
in one room watching "Name That Tune,"   
their father in another watching   
a Walter Cronkite Special, the TVs   
turned up high and higher till they   
each can't hear the other's show.   
The older boy is saying that no matter   
how many stars you counted there were   
always more stars beyond them   
and beyond the stars black space   
going on forever in all directions,   
so that even if you flew up 
millions and millions of years   
you'd be no closer to the end   
of it than they were now 
here on the porch on Tuesday night   
in the middle of summer. 
The younger boy can think somehow   
only of his mother's closet,   
how he likes to crawl in back   
behind the heavy drapery 
of shirts, nightgowns and dresses,   
into the sheer black where 
no matter how close he holds   
his hand up to his face 
there's no hand ever, no 
face to hold it to. 

A woman from another street 
is calling to her stray cat or dog,   
clapping and whistling it in, 
and farther away deep in the city   
sirens now and again 
veer in and out of hearing. 

The boys edge closer, shoulder   
to shoulder now, sad Ptolemies, 
the older looking up, the younger 
as he thinks back straight ahead 
into the black leaves of the maple 
where the street lights flicker 
like another watery skein of stars. 
"Name That Tune" and Walter Cronkite 
struggle like rough water 
to rise above each other. 
And the woman now comes walking 
in a nightgown down the middle 
of the street, clapping and 
whistling, while the older boy 
goes on about what light years 
are, and solar winds, black holes, 
and how the sun is cooling 
and what will happen to 
them all when it is cold.

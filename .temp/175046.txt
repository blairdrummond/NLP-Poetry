 
In the sad November time, 
When the leaf has left the lime, 
And the Cam, with sludge and slime, 
      Plasters his ugly channel, 
While, with sober step and slow, 
Round about the marshes low, 
Stiffening students stumping go 
      Shivering through their flannel. 

Then to me in doleful mood 
Rises up a question rude, 
Asking what sufficient good 
      Comes of this mode of living? 
Moping on from day to day, 
Grinding up what will not "pay," 
Till the jaded brain gives way 
      Under its own misgiving. 

Why should wretched Man employ 
Years which Nature meant for joy, 
Striving vainly to destroy 
      Freedom of thought and feeling? 
Still the injured powers remain 
Endless stores of hopeless pain, 
When at last the vanquished brain 
      Languishes past all healing. 

Where is then his wealth of mind-- 
All the schemes that Hope designed? 
Gone, like spring, to leave behind 
      Indolent melancholy. 
Thus he ends his helpless days, 
Vex't with thoughts of former praise-- 
Tell me, how are Wisdom's ways 
      Better than senseless Folly? 

Happier those whom trifles please, 
Dreaming out a life of ease, 
Sinking by unfelt degrees 
      Into annihilation. 
Or the slave, to labour born, 
Heedless of the freeman's scorn, 
Destined to be slowly worn 
      Down to the brute creation. 

Thus a tempting spirit spoke, 
As from troubled sleep I woke 
To a morning thick with smoke, 
      Sunless and damp and chilly. 
Then to sleep I turned once more, 
Eyes inflamed and windpipe sore, 
Dreaming dreams I dreamt before, 
      Only not quite so silly. 

In my dream methought I strayed 
Where a learned-looking maid 
Stores of flimsy goods displayed, 
      Articles not worth wearing. 
"These," she said, with solemn air, 
"Are the robes that sages wear, 
Warranted, when kept with care, 
      Never to need repairing." 

Then unnumbered witlings, caught 
By her wiles, the trappings bought, 
And by labour, not by thought, 
      Honour and fame were earning. 
While the men of wiser mind 
Passed for blind among the blind; 
Pedants left them far behind 
      In the career of learning. 

"Those that fix their eager eyes 
Ever on the nearest prize 
Well may venture to despise 
      Loftier aspirations. 
Pedantry is in demand! 
Buy it up at second-hand, 
Seek no more to understand 
      Profitless speculations." 

Thus the gaudy gowns were sold, 
Cast off sloughs of pedants old; 
Proudly marched the students bold 
      Through the domain of error, 
Till their trappings, false though fair, 
Mouldered off and left them bare, 
Clustering close in blank despair, 
      Nakedness, cold, and terror. 

Then, I said, "These haughty Schools 
Boast that by their formal rules 
They produce more learned fools 
      Than could be well expected. 
Learned fools they are indeed, 
Learned in the books they read; 
Fools whene'er they come to need 
      Wisdom, too long neglected. 

"Oh! that men indeed were wise, 
And would raise their purblind eyes 
To the opening mysteries 
      Scattered around them ever. 
Truth should spring from sterile ground, 
Beauty beam from all around, 
Right should then at last be found 
      Joining what none may sever."

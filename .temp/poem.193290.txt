There's a flutter of grey through the trees:
   Ah, the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes
   Fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is!

I see not her face, I but see
   The swift re-appearance, the flitting persistence--
   There!--of that flutter of grey in the distance.

It has flickered and fluttered away:
   What a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream,
   And what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may 
         dream!

It was only a flutter of grey;
   But the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances
   Has set my heart beating the way of old dances.

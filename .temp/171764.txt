 
Between pond and sheepbarn, by maples and watery birches,   
Rebecca paces a double line of rust 
in a sandy trench, striding on black 
creosoted eight-by-eights. 
                                       In nineteen-forty-three, 
wartrains skidded tanks, 
airframes, dynamos, searchlights, and troops 
to Montreal. She counted cars 
from the stopped hayrack at the endless crossing:   
ninety-nine, one hundred; and her grandfather Ben's   
voice shaking with rage and oratory told 
how the mighty Boston and Maine 
kept the Statehouse in its pocket. 
                                                   Today Rebecca walks   
a line that vanishes, in solitude 
bypassed by wars and commerce. She remembers the story   
of the bunting'd day her great-great-great- 
grandmother watched the first train roll and smoke   
from Potter Place to Gale 
with fireworks, cider, and speeches. Then the long rail   
drove west, buzzing and humming; the hive of rolling stock   
extended a thousand-car'd perspective 
from Ohio to Oregon, where men who left stone farms   
rode rails toward gold. 
                                  On this blue day she walks   
under a high jet's glint of swooped aluminum pulling   
its feathery contrail westward. She sees ahead   
how the jet dies into junk, and highway wastes   
like railroad. Beside her the old creation retires,   
hayrack sunk like a rowboat 
under its fields of hay. She closes her eyes 
to glimpse the vertical track that rises 
from the underworld of graves, 
soul's ascension connecting dead to unborn, rails   
that hum with a hymn of continual vanishing   
where tracks cross. 
                            For she opens her eyes to read   
on a solitary gravestone next to the rails 
the familiar names of Ruth and Matthew Bott, born   
in a Norfolk parish, who ventured 
the immigrant's passionate Exodus westward to labor   
on their own land. Here love builds 
its mortal house, where today's wind carries   
a double scent of heaven and cut hay.

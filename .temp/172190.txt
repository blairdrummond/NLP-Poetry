 
As I reach to close each book 
lying open on my desk, it leaps up   
to snap at my fingers. My legs 
won't hold me, I must sit down. 
My fingers pain me 
where the thick leaves snapped together   
at my touch. 
                   All my life 
I've held books in my hands 
like children, carefully turning 
their pages and straightening out   
their creases. I use books 
almost apologetically. I believe 
I often think their thoughts for them.   
Reading, I never know where theirs leave off   
and mine begin. I am so much alone   
in the world, I can observe the stars   
or study the breeze, I can count the steps   
on a stair on the way up or down,   
and I can look at another human being   
and get a smile, knowing 
it is for the sake of politeness. 
Nothing must be said of estrangement   
among the human race and yet 
nothing is said at all 
because of that. 
But no book will help either. 
I stroke my desk, 
its wood so smooth, so patient and still.   
I set a typewriter on its surface 
and begin to type 
to tell myself my troubles. 
Against the evidence, I live by choice.

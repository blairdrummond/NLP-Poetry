 
It was a' for our rightful king 
         That we left fair Scotland's strand; 
It was a' for our rightful king 
         We e'er saw Irish land, 
                My dear, 
         We e'er saw Irish land. 

Now a' is done that men can do, 
         And a' is done in vain! 
My love, and native land, fareweel! 
         For I maun cross the main, 
                My dear, 
         For I maun cross the main. 

He turn'd him right and round about, 
         Upon the Irish shore, 
He gave his bridle-reins a shake, 
         With, Adieu for evermore, 
                My dear! 
         And adieu for evermore! 

The soldier frae the war returns, 
         And the merchant frae the main. 
But I hae parted frae my love, 
         Never to meet again, 
                My dear, 
         Never to meet again. 

When day is gone and night is come, 
         And a' folk bound to sleep, 
I think on him that's far awa 
         The lee-lang night, and weep, 
                My dear, 
         The lee-lang night, and weep.

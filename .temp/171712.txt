 
To turn a stone 
with its white squirming 
underneath, to pry the disc 
from the sun's eclipse--white heat 
coiling in the blinded eye: to these malign   
necessities we come 
from the dim time of dinosaurs 
who crawled like breathing lava 
from the earth's cracked crust, and swung   
their tiny heads above the lumbering tons   
of flesh, brains no bigger than a fist 
clenched to resist the white flash 
in the sky the day the sun-flares 
pared them down to relics for museums,   
turned glaciers back, seared Sinai's 
meadows black--the ferns withered, the swamps   
were melted down to molten mud, the cells   
uncoupled, recombined, and madly 
multiplied, huge trees toppled to the ground,   
the slow life there abandoned hope, 
a caterpillar stiffened in the grass. 
Two apes, caught in the act of coupling,   
made a mutant child 
who woke to sunlight wondering, his mother   
torn by the huge new head 
that forced the narrow birth canal. 

As if compelled to repetition   
and to unearth again 
white fire at the heart of matter--fire 
we sought and fire we spoke, 
our thoughts, however elegant, were fire 
from first to last--like sentries set to watch   
at Argos for the signal fire 
passed peak to peak from Troy 
to Nagasaki, triumphant echo of the burning   
city walls and prologue to the murders   
yet to come--we scan the sky 
for that bright flash, 
our eyes stared white from watching   
for the signal fire that ends 
the epic--a cursed line 
with its caesura, a pause 
to signal peace, or a rehearsal 
for the silence.

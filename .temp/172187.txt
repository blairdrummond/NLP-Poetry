 
I am looking for a past   
I can rely on 
in order to look to death   
with equanimity. 
What was given me:   
my mother's largeness   
to protect me, 
my father's regularity 
in coming home from work   
at night, his opening the door   
silently and smiling,   
pleased to be back 
and the lights on 
in all the rooms 
through which I could run   
freely or sit at ease 
at table and do my homework   
undisturbed: love arranged 
as order directed at the next day.   
Going to bed was a journey.

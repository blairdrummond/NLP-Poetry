 
Don't let that horse 
                              eat that violin 

    cried Chagall's mother 

                                     But he   
                      kept right on 
                                     painting 

And became famous 

And kept on painting 
                              The Horse With Violin In Mouth 

And when he finally finished it 
he jumped up upon the horse 
                                        and rode away   
          waving the violin 

And then with a low bow gave it 
to the first naked nude he ran across 


And there were no strings   
                                     attached

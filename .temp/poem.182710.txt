Street Yarn
Roses caged in windows, heighten
    Your faint blooms today;
Silks and sheeny satins, brighten;
    He has passed this way!

Could ye keep his fleeting presence
    Gone beyond recall,
But a little of his essence,
    I would have you all.

Arabesque so quaint and shady,
    That mightst catch his eye
To adorn a stately lady
    Ere her hour went by,

Canst assure me that his glancing
    Rested on they fold?
Did that set your purples dancing?
    Wake the sleepy gold?

Ye neglected apple-venders
    Mouldering in the street,
Did he curse between your tenders,
    Spurning with his feet?

Then must I an alms deliver
    For his graceless pride;
Could I buy his sins forever,
    I'd not be denied.

Paying patiently his ransom
    Never conscience-pricked;
Cheating Justice of her handsome
    Heartless derelict.

Did he view thee, ancient steeple,
    With thy weird clock-face,
Frowning down on sinful people
    Passing out of grace?

Nay, respond not to my question
    With thy prate of time:
Things to which my soul must hasten
    Lie beyond thy chime.

With no circumstance to screen us,
    We must meet again:
I shall bid God judge between us,
    Answering Amen.

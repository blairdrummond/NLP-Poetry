 
Go your seeking, soul. 
Mine the proven path of time's foretelling.   
Yours accordance with some mysteried whole.   
I am but your passion-haunted dwelling. 

Bring what news you can, 
Stranger, loved of body's humbled heart.   
Say one whispered word to mortal man   
From that peace whereof he claims you part. 

Hither-hence, my guest, 
Blood and bone befriend, where you abide   
Till withdrawn to share some timeless quest.   
I am but the brain that dreamed and died.

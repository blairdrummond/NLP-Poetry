Three lovely notes he whistled, too soft to be heard
 If others sang; but others never sang
 In the great beech-wood all that May and June.
 No one saw him: I alone could hear him
 Though many listened. Was it but four years
 Ago? or five? He never came again.


 Oftenest when I heard him I was alone,
 Nor could I ever make another hear.
 La-la-la! he called, seeming far-off--
 As if a cock crowed past the edge of the world,
 As if the bird or I were in a dream.
 Yet that he travelled through the trees and sometimes
 Neared me, was plain, though somehow distant still
 He sounded. All the proof is--I told men
 What I had heard.


                                    I never knew a voice,
 Man, beast, or bird, better than this. I told
 The naturalists; but neither had they heard
 Anything like the notes that did so haunt me,
 I had them clear by heart and have them still.
 Four years, or five, have made no difference. Then
 As now that La-la-la! was bodiless sweet:
 Sad more than joyful it was, if I must say
 That it was one or other, but if sad
 'Twas sad only with joy too, too far off
 For me to taste it. But I cannot tell
 If truly never anything but fair
 The days were when he sang, as now they seem.
 This surely I know, that I who listened then,
 Happy sometimes, sometimes suffering
 A heavy body and a heavy heart,
 Now straightway, if I think of it, become
 Light as that bird wandering beyond my shore.

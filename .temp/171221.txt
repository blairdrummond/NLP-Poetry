 
I want a red dress. 
I want it flimsy and cheap, 
I want it too tight, I want to wear it   
until someone tears it off me. 
I want it sleeveless and backless, 
this dress, so no one has to guess 
what's underneath. I want to walk down 
the street past Thrifty's and the hardware store   
with all those keys glittering in the window,   
past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old   
donuts in their cafe, past the Guerra brothers   
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly,   
hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders.   
I want to walk like I'm the only 
woman on earth and I can have my pick.   
I want that red dress bad. 
I want it to confirm 
your worst fears about me, 
to show you how little I care about you   
or anything except what 
I want. When I find it, I'll pull that garment   
from its hanger like I'm choosing a body   
to carry me into this world, through   
the birth-cries and the love-cries too,   
and I'll wear it like bones, like skin,   
it'll be the goddamned 
dress they bury me in.

To-night the winds begin to rise 
         And roar from yonder dropping day: 
         The last red leaf is whirl'd away, 
The rooks are blown about the skies; 

The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd, 
         The cattle huddled on the lea; 
         And wildly dash'd on tower and tree 
The sunbeam strikes along the world: 

And but for fancies, which aver 
         That all thy motions gently pass 
         Athwart a plane of molten glass, 
I scarce could brook the strain and stir 

That makes the barren branches loud; 
         And but for fear it is not so, 
         The wild unrest that lives in woe 
Would dote and pore on yonder cloud 

That rises upward always higher, 
         And onward drags a labouring breast, 
         And topples round the dreary west, 
A looming bastion fringed with fire.

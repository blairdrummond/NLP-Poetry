 
Creo que si ... I believe   
it will rain 
tomorrow ... I believe   
the son of a bitch 


is going into the river ... 
I believe All men are 
created equal--By your   
leave a leafy 

shelter over the exposed   
person--I'm a 
believer creature 
of habit but without 

out there a void of   
pattern older 
older the broken   
pieces no longer 

salvageable bits 
but incommensurate   
chips yet must 
get it back together. 

In God we 
trust emptiness privilege   
will not not perish 
perish from this earth-- 


In particular echo 
of inside pushes 
at edges all these years   
collapse in slow motion. 

The will to believe,   
the will to be good,   
the will to want 
a way out-- 

Humanness, like 
you, man. Us--pun 
for once beyond reflective   
mirror of brightening prospect? 

I believe what it was   
was a hope it could be   
somehow what it was   
and would so continue. 

A plank to walk out on, 
fair enough. Jump! said the pirate.   
Believe me if all 
those endearing young charms ...   


Here, as opposed to there,   
even in confusions there seems   
still a comfort, 
still a faith. 

I'd as lief 
not leave, not   
go away, not   
not believe. 

I believe in belief ...   
All said, whatever I can think of   
comes from there, 
goes there. 

As it gets now impossible   
to say, it's your hand 
I hold to, still 
your hand.

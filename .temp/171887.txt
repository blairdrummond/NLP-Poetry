 
No sooner does the plane angle up 
than I cork off to dream a bomb blast: 
A fireball roiling through the cabin in slo-mo,   
seat blown loose from its bolts, 
I hang weightless a nanosecond 
         in blue space 

then jerk awake to ordered rows. 
And there's the silver liquor cart jangling   
its thousand bells, the perfect doses   
of juniper gin and oak-flavored scotch 
         held by a rose-nailed hand. 

I don't miss drinking, don't miss 
driving into shit with more molecular density   
than myself, nor the Mission Impossible 
reruns I sat before, nor the dead 
space inside only alcohol could fill and then   
         not even. But I miss 

the aftermath, the pure simplicity: 
mouth parched, head hissing static. 
How little I asked of myself then--to suck   
the next breath, suffer the next heave, live   
till cocktail hour when I could mix 
         the next sickness. 

I locked the bathroom door, sat   
on the closed commode, shirtless, 
in filmy underpants telling myself that death   
could fit my grasp and be staved off   
while in the smeary shaving glass,   
I practiced the stillness of a soul 
         awaiting birth. 

For the real that swarmed beyond the door 
I was pure scorn, dead center of my stone and starless   
universe, orbited by no one. Novitiate obliterate, Saint   
Absence, Duchess of Naught . . . 
A stinging ether folded me in mist. 

Sometimes landing the head's pressure's enormous.   
When my plane tilts down, houses grow large, streets 
lose their clear geometry. The leafy earth soon fills my portal,   
and in the gray graveyard of cars, a stick figure 
becomes my son in royal blue cap flapping his arms   
as if to rise. Thank god for our place 
in this forest of forms, for the gravitas 
that draws me back to him, and for how lightly 
         lightly I touch down.

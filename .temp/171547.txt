 
Look! From my window there's a view   
of city streets 
where only lives as dry as tortoises   
can crawl--the Gallapagos of desire. 

There is the day of Negroes with red hair 
and the day of insane women on the subway;   
there is the day of the word Trieste 
and the night of the blind man with the electric guitar. 

But I have no profession. Like a spy 
I read the papers--Situations Wanted.   
Surely there is a secret 
which, if I knew it, would change everything!

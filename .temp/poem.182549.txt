This rose-tree is not made to bear 
The violet blue, nor lily fair, 
   Nor the sweet mignionet: 
And if this tree were discontent, 
Or wished to change its natural bent, 
   It all in vain would fret. 

And should it fret, you would suppose 
It ne'er had seen its own red rose, 
   Nor after gentle shower 
Had ever smelled its rose's scent, 
Or it could ne'er be discontent 
   With its own pretty flower. 

Like such a blind and senseless tree 
As I've imagined this to be, 
   All envious persons are: 
With care and culture all may find 
Some pretty flower in their own mind, 
   Some talent that is rare.

1915-1916




            Phantasmal fears, 
            And the flap of the flame, 
            And the throb of the clock, 
            And a loosened slate, 
            And the blind night's drone, 
Which tiredly the spectral pines intone! 





            And the blood in my ears 
            Strumming always the same, 
            And the gable-cock 
            With its fitful grate, 
            And myself, alone.





            The twelfth hour nears 
            Hand-hid, as in shame; 
            I undo the lock, 
            And listen, and wait 
            For the Young Unknown. 





            In the dark there careers -- 
            As if Death astride came 
            To numb all with his knock -- 
            A horse at mad rate 
            Over rut and stone. 





            No figure appears, 
            No call of my name, 
            No sound but 'Tic-toc' 
            Without check. Past the gate 
            It clatters -- is gone. 





            What rider it bears 
            There is none to proclaim; 
            And the Old Year has struck,
            And, scarce animate, 
            The New makes moan. 





            Maybe that 'More Tears! -- 
            More Famine and Flame -- 
            More Severance and Shock!' 
            Is the order from Fate 
            That the Rider speeds on 
To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone.

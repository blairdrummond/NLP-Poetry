And wherefore do the Poor complain? 
The rich man asked of me,-- 
Come walk abroad with me, I said 
And I will answer thee. 

Twas evening and the frozen streets 
Were cheerless to behold, 
And we were wrapt and coated well, 
And yet we were a-cold. 

We met an old bare-headed man, 
His locks were few and white, 
I ask'd him what he did abroad 
In that cold winter's night: 

'Twas bitter keen indeed, he said, 
But at home no fire had he, 
And therefore, he had come abroad 
To ask for charity. 

We met a young bare-footed child, 
And she begg'd loud and bold, 
I ask'd her what she did abroad 
When the wind it blew so cold; 

She said her father was at home 
And he lay sick a-bed, 
And therefore was it she was sent 
Abroad to beg for bread. 

We saw a woman sitting down 
Upon a stone to rest, 
She had a baby at her back 
And another at her breast; 

I ask'd her why she loiter'd there 
When the wind it was so chill; 
She turn'd her head and bade the child 
That scream'd behind be still. 

She told us that her husband served 
A soldier, far away, 
And therefore to her parish she 
Was begging back her way. 

We met a girl; her dress was loose 
And sunken was her eye, 
Who with the wanton's hollow voice 
Address'd the passers by; 

I ask'd her what there was in guilt 
That could her heart allure 
To shame, disease, and late remorse? 
She answer'd, she was poor. 

I turn'd me to the rich man then 
For silently stood he, 
You ask'd me why the Poor complain, 
And these have answer'd thee.

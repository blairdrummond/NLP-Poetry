 
Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine, 
That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told; 
Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine, 
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold. 
Or else let them in statelier glory shine, 
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old; 
Or with strange similes enrich each line, 
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold. 
For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know; 
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow, 
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites. 
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read 
What love and beauty be; then all my deed 
But copying is, what in her Nature writes.

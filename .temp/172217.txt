 
What do we need for love--a midnight fire 
Flinging itself by fistfuls up the chimney 
In soft bright snatches? Do we need the snow, 
Gentle as silence, covering the scars 
Of weeks of hunger, years of shabby having? 
Summer or winter? A heaven of stars? A room? 
The smiling mouth, the sadness of desire 
Are everywhere the same. If lovers go 
Along an unknown road, they find no less 
What is familiar. Let them stay at home, 
And all will still be strange. This they know 
Who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change.

I strayed about the deck, an hour, to-night
 Under a cloudy moonless sky; and peeped
 In at the windows, watched my friends at table,
 Or playing cards, or standing in the doorway,
 Or coming out into the darkness. Still
 No one could see me.


                                          I would have thought of them
--Heedless, within a week of battle--in pity,
 Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness
 And link'd beauty of bodies, and pity that
 This gay machine of splendour 'ld soon be broken,
 Thought little of, pashed, scattered. ...


                                                                        Only, always,
 I could but see them--against the lamplight--pass
 Like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass,
 Slight bubbles, fainter than the wave's faint light,
 That broke to phosphorus out in the night,
 Perishing things and strange ghosts--soon to die
 To other ghosts--this one, or that, or I.

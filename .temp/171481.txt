 
The light has traveled unthinkable thousands of miles to be   
condensed, recharged, and poured off the white white pages 
of an open Bible the country parson holds in front of this couple   
in a field, in July, in the sap and the flyswirl of July 
in upper Wisconsin, where their vows buzz in a ring in the air 
like the flies, and are as sweet as the sap, in these rich and ritual minutes.   
Is it sentimental? Oops. And out of that Bible the light continues   
to rush as if from a faucet. There will be a piecrust cooling   
out of its own few x'ed-out cuts. And will it make us run   
for the picklier taste of irony rolled around protectively on our tongues   
like a grab of Greek olives? My students and I discuss this   
slippery phenomenon. Does "context" matter? Does 
"earned" count? If a balled-up fidget of snakes 
in the underbrush dies in a freeze is it sentimental? No,   
yes, maybe. What if a litter of cocker spaniels? What 
if we called them "puppydogs" in the same poem in that same hard,   
hammering winter? When my father was buried, 
the gray snow in the cemetery was sheet tin. If I said 
that? Yes, no, what does "tone" or "history" do 
to the Hollywood hack violinists who patiently wait to play   
the taut nerves of the closest human body until from that   
lush cue alone, the eyes swell moistly, and the griefs 
we warehouse daily take advantage of this thinning 
of our systems, then the first sloppy gushes begin . . . 
Is that "wrong"? Did I tell you the breaths 
of the gravediggers puffed out like factorysmoke 
as they bent and straightened, bent and straightened, 
mechanically? Are wise old (toothless) Black blues singers   
sentimental?--"gran'ma"? "country cookin'"? But 
they have their validity, don't they, yes? their 
sweat-in-the-creases, picking up the lighting 
in a fine-lined mesh of what it means to have gone through time   
alive a little bit on this planet. Hands shoot up . . . opinions . . . 
questions . . . What if the sun wept? the moon? Why, in the face 
of those open faces, are we so squeamish? Call out 
the crippled girl and her only friend the up-for-sale foal,   
and let her tootle her woeful pennywhistle musics. 
What if some chichi streetwise junkass from the demimonde 
gave forth with the story of orphans forced through howling storm   
to the workhouse, letting it swing between the icy-blue   
quotation marks of cynicism--then? What if   
I wept? What if I simply put the page down,   
rocked my head in my own folded elbows, forgot   
the rest of it all, and wept? What if I stepped into   
the light of that page, a burnished and uncompromising   
light, and walked back up to his stone a final time,   
just that, no drama, and it was so cold, 
and the air was so brittle, metal buckled 
out song like a bandsaw, and there, from inside me,   
where they'd been lost in shame and sophistry 
all these years now, every last one of my childhood's   
heartwormed puppydogs found its natural voice.

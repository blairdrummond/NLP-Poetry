 
I would be 
A painter with words 
Creating sharp portraits 
On the wide canvas of your mind   
Images of those things 
Shaped through my eyes 
That interest me; 
But being a Tenth American   
In this democracy 
I sometimes sketch a miniature   
Though I contract for a mural. 

Of course 
You understand this democracy; 
One man as good as another, 
From log cabin to White House, 
Poor boy to corporation president,   
Hoover and Browder with one vote each,   
A free country, 
Complete equality-- 
Yeah-- 
And the rich get tax refunds, 
The poor get relief checks. 

As for myself 
I pay five cents for a daily synopsis of current history, 
Two bits and the late lowdown on Hollywood, 
Twist a dial for Stardust or Shostakovich, 
And with each bleacher stub I reserve the right to shout "kill the bum" at the umpire-- 
Wherefore am I different 
From nine other Americans? 

But listen, you 
Don't worry about me 
I rate! 
I'm Convert 4711 at Beulah Baptist Church,   
I'm Social Security No. 337-16-3458 in Washington, 
Thank you Mister God and Mister Roosevelt! 
And another thing:-- 
No matter what happens 
I too can always call in a policeman!

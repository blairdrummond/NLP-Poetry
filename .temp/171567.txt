 
Comes the time when it's later 
and onto your table the headwaiter   
puts the bill, and very soon after 
rings out the sound of lively laughter-- 

Picking up change, hands like a walrus,   
and a face like a barndoor's, 
and a head without any apparent size,   
nothing but two eyes-- 

So that's you, man, 
or me. I make it as I can,   
I pick up, I go 
faster than they know-- 

Out the door, the street like a night,   
any night, and no one in sight,   
but then, well, there she is, 
old friend Liz-- 

And she opens the door of her cadillac,   
I step in back, 
and we're gone. 
She turns me on-- 

There are very huge stars, man, in the sky, 
and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie, 
with a gob of white, white ice cream on top of it,   
and I eat it-- 

Slowly. And while certainly 
they are laughing at me, and all around me is racket   
of these cats not making it, I make it 

in my wicker basket.

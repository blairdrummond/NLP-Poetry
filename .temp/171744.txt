 
The star dissolved in evening--the one star   
The silently 
                   and night O soon now, soon   
And still the light now 
                                    and still now the large   
Relinquishing 
                     and through the pools of blue   
Still, still the swallows 
                                       and a wind now 
                                                            and the tree   
Gathering darkness: 
                              I was small. I lay   
Beside my mother on the grass, and sleep   
Came-- 

          slow hooves and dripping with the dark   
The velvet muzzles, the white feet that move   
In a dream water 
                        and O soon now soon 
Sleep and the night. 

                              And I was not afraid.   
Her hand lay over mine. Her fingers knew   
Darkness,--and sleep--the silent lands, the far   
Far off of morning where I should awake.

 
Whatever we do, whether we light 
strangers' cigarettes--it may turn out 
to be a detective wanting to know who is free   
with a light on a lonely street nights-- 
or whether we turn away and get a knife 
planted between our shoulders for our discourtesy;   
whatever we do--whether we marry for love   
and wake up to find love is a task, 
or whether for convenience to find love   
must be won over, or we are desperate-- 
whatever we do; save by dying, 
and there too we are caught, 
by being planted too close to our parents.

We deemed the secret lost, the spirit gone,   
Which spake in Greek simplicity of thought,   
And in the forms of gods and heroes wrought   
Eternal beauty from the sculptured stone,-- 
A higher charm than modern culture won   
With all the wealth of metaphysic lore,   
Gifted to analyze, dissect, explore. 
A many-colored light flows from one sun; 
Art, 'neath its beams, a motley thread has spun;   
The prism modifies the perfect day; 
But thou hast known such mediums to shun,   
And cast once more on life a pure, white ray.   
Absorbed in the creations of thy mind,   
Forgetting daily self, my truest self I find.

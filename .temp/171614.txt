 
A snake is the love of a thumb   
and forefinger. 
Other times, an arm 
that has swallowed a bicep. 

The air behind this one   
is like a knot 
in a child's shoelace 
come undone 
while you were blinking. 

It is bearing something away.   
What? What time   
does the next snake leave? 

This one's tail is ravelling   
into its burrow-- 
a rosary returned to a purse. 
The snake is the last time your spine   
could go anywhere alone.

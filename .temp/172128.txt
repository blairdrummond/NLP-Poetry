 
1. The Cane Fields 

There is a parrot imitating spring 
in the palace, its feathers parsley green.   
Out of the swamp the cane appears 

to haunt us, and we cut it down. El General   
searches for a word; he is all the world   
there is. Like a parrot imitating spring, 

we lie down screaming as rain punches through   
and we come up green. We cannot speak an R-- 
out of the swamp, the cane appears 

and then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina. 
The children gnaw their teeth to arrowheads.   
There is a parrot imitating spring. 

El General has found his word: perejil. 
Who says it, lives. He laughs, teeth shining   
out of the swamp. The cane appears 

in our dreams, lashed by wind and streaming.   
And we lie down. For every drop of blood   
there is a parrot imitating spring. 
Out of the swamp the cane appears. 


2. The Palace 

The word the general's chosen is parsley.   
It is fall, when thoughts turn 
to love and death; the general thinks 
of his mother, how she died in the fall 
and he planted her walking cane at the grave   
and it flowered, each spring stolidly forming   
four-star blossoms. The general 

pulls on his boots, he stomps to 
her room in the palace, the one without   
curtains, the one with a parrot 
in a brass ring. As he paces he wonders   
Who can I kill today. And for a moment   
the little knot of screams 
is still. The parrot, who has traveled 

all the way from Australia in an ivory   
cage, is, coy as a widow, practising   
spring. Ever since the morning   
his mother collapsed in the kitchen   
while baking skull-shaped candies   
for the Day of the Dead, the general   
has hated sweets. He orders pastries   
brought up for the bird; they arrive 

dusted with sugar on a bed of lace.   
The knot in his throat starts to twitch;   
he sees his boots the first day in battle   
splashed with mud and urine 
as a soldier falls at his feet amazed-- 
how stupid he looked!-- at the sound 
of artillery. I never thought it would sing   
the soldier said, and died. Now 

the general sees the fields of sugar   
cane, lashed by rain and streaming.   
He sees his mother's smile, the teeth   
gnawed to arrowheads. He hears   
the Haitians sing without R's 
as they swing the great machetes:   
Katalina, they sing, Katalina, 

mi madle, mi amol en muelte. God knows   
his mother was no stupid woman; she   
could roll an R like a queen. Even   
a parrot can roll an R! In the bare room   
the bright feathers arch in a parody   
of greenery, as the last pale crumbs 
disappear under the blackened tongue. Someone 

calls out his name in a voice 
so like his mother's, a startled tear 
splashes the tip of his right boot. 
My mother, my love in death. 
The general remembers the tiny green sprigs   
men of his village wore in their capes   
to honor the birth of a son. He will 
order many, this time, to be killed 

for a single, beautiful word.

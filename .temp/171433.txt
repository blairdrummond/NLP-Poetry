 
And now the green household is dark.   
The half-moon completely is shining   
On the earth-lighted tops of the trees.   
To be dead, a house must be still. 
The floor and the walls wave me slowly;   
I am deep in them over my head.   
The needles and pine cones about me 

Are full of small birds at their roundest,   
Their fist without mercy gripping 
Hard down through the tree to the roots   
To sing back at light when they feel it.   
We lie here like angels in bodies, 
My brothers and I, one dead, 
The other asleep from much living, 

In mid-air huddled beside me. 
Dark climbed to us here as we climbed 
Up the nails I have hammered all day 
Through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder   
Of broom handles, crate slats, and laths 
Foot by foot up the trunk to the branches   
Where we came out at last over lakes 

Of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth   
That move with the moves of the spirit.   
Each nail that sustains us I set here; 
Each nail in the house is now steadied 
By my dead brother's huge, freckled hand.   
Through the years, he has pointed his hammer   
Up into these limbs, and told us 

That we must ascend, and all lie here.   
Step after step he has brought me,   
Embracing the trunk as his body, 
Shaking its limbs with my heartbeat,   
Till the pine cones danced without wind   
And fell from the branches like apples.   
In the arm-slender forks of our dwelling 

I breathe my live brother's light hair.   
The blanket around us becomes 
As solid as stone, and it sways. 
With all my heart, I close 
The blue, timeless eye of my mind.   
Wind springs, as my dead brother smiles   
And touches the tree at the root; 

A shudder of joy runs up 
The trunk; the needles tingle;   
One bird uncontrollably cries. 
The wind changes round, and I stir   
Within another's life. Whose life? 
Who is dead? Whose presence is living?   
When may I fall strangely to earth, 

Who am nailed to this branch by a spirit?   
Can two bodies make up a third? 
To sing, must I feel the world's light?   
My green, graceful bones fill the air   
With sleeping birds. Alone, alone 
And with them I move gently. 
I move at the heart of the world.

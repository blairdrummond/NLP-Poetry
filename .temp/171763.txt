 
Ruminant pillows! Gregarious soft boulders! 

If one of you found a gap in a stone wall, 
the rest of you--rams, ewes, bucks, wethers, lambs;   
mothers and daughters, old grandfather-father,   
cousins and aunts, small bleating sons-- 
followed onward, stupid 
as sheep, wherever 
your leader's sheep-brain wandered to. 

My grandfather spent all day searching the valley   
and edges of Ragged Mountain, 
calling "Ke-day!" as if he brought you salt,   
"Ke-day! Ke-day!" 


When the shirt wore out, and darns in the woolen   
shirt needed darning, 
a woman in a white collar 
cut the shirt into strips and braided it,   
as she braided her hair every morning. 

In a hundred years 
the knees of her great-granddaughter 
crawled on a rug made from the wool of sheep   
whose bones were mud, 
like the bones of the woman, who stares   
from an oval in the parlor. 


I forked the brambly hay down to you 
in nineteen-fifty. I delved my hands deep   
in the winter grass of your hair. 

When the shearer cut to your nakedness in April   
and you dropped black eyes in shame, 
hiding in barnyard corners, unable to hide,   
I brought grain to raise your spirits, 
and ten thousand years 
wound us through pasture and hayfield together,   
threads of us woven 
together, three hundred generations 
from Africa's hills to New Hampshire's. 


You were not shrewd like the pig.   
You were not strong like the horse.   
You were not brave like the rooster. 

Yet none of the others looked like a lump of granite   
that grew hair, 
and none of the others 
carried white fleece as soft as dandelion seed   
around a black face, 
and none of them sang such a flat and sociable song.

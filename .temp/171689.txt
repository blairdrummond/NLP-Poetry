 
How much death works,   
No one knows what a long   
Day he puts in. The little   
Wife always alone 
Ironing death's laundry.   
The beautiful daughters   
Setting death's supper table.   
The neighbors playing   
Pinochle in the backyard   
Or just sitting on the steps   
Drinking beer. Death,   
Meanwhile, in a strange   
Part of town looking for   
Someone with a bad cough, 
But the address is somehow wrong,   
Even death can't figure it out   
Among all the locked doors ...    
And the rain beginning to fall.   
Long windy night ahead.   
Death with not even a newspaper   
To cover his head, not even   
A dime to call the one pining away,   
Undressing slowly, sleepily,   
And stretching naked   
On death's side of the bed.

 
It's a kitchen. Its curtains fill 
with a morning light so bright   
you can't see beyond its windows   
into the afternoon. A kitchen   
falling through time with its things   
in their places, the dishes jingling   
up in the cupboard, the bucket   
of drinking water rippled as if 
a truck had just gone past, but that truck   
was thirty years. No one's at home   
in this room. Its counter is wiped,   
and the dishrag hangs from its nail,   
a dry leaf. In housedresses of mist,   
blue aprons of rain, my grandmother   
moved through this life like a ghost,   
and when she had finished her years,   
she put them all back in their places 
and wiped out the sink, turning her back   
on the rest of us, forever.

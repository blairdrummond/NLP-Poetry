 
for M.H.
Friend, remember how you showed us beasts love beauty?   
We were wading in your lake with bluegills and you said,   
Be careful, you will lose your beauty marks 

To their little jaws. We were a delicacy. From us they purchased 
The darkest part of the skin, only what contrasts on us.   
And it was more than a pinch or sting, 

It's a sensation of hunger 
That makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep   
And safe. "No blue stripes on cheeks; no red on fins; 

Old individual's belly coppery red or brassy."   
As others see you, I think these indicate, 
Who would have you all one shade then wouldn't have you. 

At your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,   
We read in the book the fish that liked us 
Has certain maxillaries "wholly wanting." Your gourmet bluegill: 

It lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the vitreous   
Humor, would eat even your blind spot!   
But we think we can paddle out there until all 

Goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too much.

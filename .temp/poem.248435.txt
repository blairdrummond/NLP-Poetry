 


Only a man harrowing clods
    In a slow silent walk
With an old horse that stumbles and nods
    Half asleep as they stalk.



Only thin smoke without flame
    From the heaps of couch-grass;
Yet this will go onward the same
    Though Dynasties pass.



Yonder a maid and her wight
    Come whispering by:
War's annals will cloud into night
    Ere their story die.

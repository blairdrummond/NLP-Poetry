Her terrace was the sand
 And the palms and the twilight.


 She made of the motions of her wrist
 The grandiose gestures 
 Of her thought.


 The rumpling of the plumes
 Of this creature of the evening
 Came to be sleights of sails
 Over the sea.


 And thus she roamed
 In the roamings of her fan,
 Partaking of the sea,
 And of the evening,
 As they flowed around
 And uttered their subsiding sound.

 
I am a little world made cunningly 
Of elements and an angelic sprite, 
But black sin hath betray'd to endless night 
My world's both parts, and oh both parts must die. 
You which beyond that heaven which was most high 
Have found new spheres, and of new lands can write, 
Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might 
Drown my world with my weeping earnestly, 
Or wash it, if it must be drown'd no more. 
But oh it must be burnt; alas the fire 
Of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore, 
And made it fouler; let their flames retire, 
And burn me O Lord, with a fiery zeal 
Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heal.

 
Because we rage inside 
the old boundaries, 
like a young girl leaving the Church,   
scared of her parents. 

Because we all dream of saving   
the shaggy, dung-caked buffalo,   
shielding the herd with our bodies. 

Because grief unites us, 
like the locked antlers of moose   
who die on their knees in pairs.

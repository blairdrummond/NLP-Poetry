Our sweet companions--sharing your bunk and your bed 
The versts and the versts and the versts and a hunk of your bread 
The wheels' endless round 
The rivers, streaming to ground   
The road. . . 

Oh the heavenly the Gypsy the early dawn light 
Remember the breeze in the morning, the steppe silver-bright 
Wisps of blue smoke from the rise 
And the song of the wise   
Gypsy czar. . . 

In the dark midnight, under the ancient trees' shroud 
We gave you sons as perfect as night, sons 
As poor as the night 
And the nightingale chirred   
Your might. . . 

We never stopped you, companions for marvelous hours 
Poverty's passions, the impoverished meals we shared 
The fierce bonfire's glow 
And there, on the carpet below,   
Fell stars. . .

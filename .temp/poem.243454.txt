When beechen buds begin to swell,
   And woods the blue-bird's warble know,
 The yellow violet's modest bell
   Peeps from the last year's leaves below.


 Ere russet fields their green resume,
   Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare,
 To meet thee, when thy faint perfume
   Alone is in the virgin air.


 Of all her train, the hands of Spring
   First plant thee in the watery mould,
 And I have seen thee blossoming
   Beside the snow-bank's edges cold.


 Thy parent sun, who bade thee view
   Pale skies, and chilling moisture sip,
 Has bathed thee in his own bright hue,
   And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.


 Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat,
   And earthward bent thy gentle eye,
 Unapt the passing view to meet
   When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.


 Oft, in the sunless April day,
   Thy early smile has stayed my walk;
 But midst the gorgeous blooms of May,
   I passed thee on thy humble stalk.


 So they, who climb to wealth, forget
   The friends in darker fortunes tried.
 I copied them--but I regret
   That I should ape the ways of pride.


 And when again the genial hour
   Awakes the painted tribes of light,
 I'll not o'erlook the modest flower
   That made the woods of April bright.

 
Is it, then, your opinion 
                      Women are putty in your hands?   
                  Is this the face to launch upon   
                      A thousand one night stands? 

First, please, would you be so kind 
    As to define your contribution   
To modern verse, the Western mind 
    And human institutions? 

                                    Where, where is the long, flowing hair,   
                                        The velvet suit, the broad bow tie;   
                                    Where is the other-worldly air, 
                                        Where the abstracted eye? 

Describe the influence on your verse 
    Of Oscar Mudwarp's mighty line,   
The theories of Susan Schmersch 
    Or the spondee's decline. 

         You've labored to present us with 
             This mouse-sized volume; shall this equal   
         The epic glories of Joe Smith? 
             He's just brought out a sequel. 

                  Where are the beard, the bongo drums, 
                      Tattered T-shirt and grubby sandals,   
                  As who, released from Iowa, comes 
                      To tell of wondrous scandals? 

Have you subversive, out of date,   
    Or controversial ideas? 
And can you really pull your weight   
    Among such minds as these? 

                                    Ah, what avails the tenure race,   
                                        Ah, what the Ph.D., 
                                    When all departments have a place   
                                        For nincompoops like thee?

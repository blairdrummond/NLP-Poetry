 
There is no stillness in this wood. 
The quiet of this clearing 
Is the denial of my hearing 
The sounds I should. 

There is no vision in this glade. 
This tower of sun revealing 
The timbered scaffoldage is stealing 
Essence from shade. 

Only my love is love's ideal. 
The love I could discover 
In these recesses knows no lover, 
Is the unreal, 

The undefined, unanalysed, 
Unabsolute many; 
It is antithesis of any, 
In none comprised.

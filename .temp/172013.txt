 
II. Conversion 


I like to be stationary. 
                      --Bartleby 


Who is not a wild Enthusiast   

in a green meadow   

furious and fell 

Arriving on the stage of history   
I saw madness of the world 

Stripped of falsification   
and corruption 

anthems were singing in Authorem 

Father and the Father 
by my words will I be justified 

Autobiography I saw 

Legal righteousness makes us servants   
All good hearers 

Opposers or despisers 
Night page torn word missing 

The family silence   
gave up the ghost 

I feared the fall of my child   

resting quietly with some hopes   

as a bird before any 

Election--Vocation-- 
Justification-- 
Cape of Wind wreathe   
fame out laughing   
Seated on a cloud   
Seacret drift 
seacretly behest   
the dear She 
comes to all Guilty   
all circling 
Eye window soul body   
Pride cannot bow   
Ariadne's diadem   
zodiac helmet belt

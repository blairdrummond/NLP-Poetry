 
I don't mind the human race.   
I've got pretty used to them   
In these past twenty-five years.   
I don't mind if they sit next   
To me on streetcars, or eat   
In the same restaurants, if   
It's not at the same table.   
However, I don't approve   
Of a woman I respect 
Dancing with one of them. I've   
Tried asking them to my home   
Without success. I shouldn't   
Care to see my own sister   
Marry one. Even if she 
Loved him, think of the children.   
Their art is interesting,   
But certainly barbarous.   
I'm sure, if given a chance,   
They'd kill us all in our beds.   
And you must admit, they smell.

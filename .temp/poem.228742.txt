I 
Stately, kindly, lordly friend, 
      Condescend 
Here to sit by me, and turn 
Glorious eyes that smile and burn, 
Golden eyes, love's lustrous meed, 
On the golden page I read. 

All your wondrous wealth of hair, 
      Dark and fair, 
Silken-shaggy, soft and bright 
As the clouds and beams of night, 
Pays my reverent hand's caress 
Back with friendlier gentleness. 

Dogs may fawn on all and some 
      As they come; 
You, a friend of loftier mind, 
Answer friends alone in kind. 
Just your foot upon my hand 
Softly bids it understand. 

Morning round this silent sweet 
      Garden-seat 
Sheds its wealth of gathering light, 
Thrills the gradual clouds with might, 
Changes woodland, orchard, heath, 
Lawn, and garden there beneath. 

Fair and dim they gleamed below: 
      Now they glow 
Deep as even your sunbright eyes, 
Fair as even the wakening skies. 
Can it not or can it be 
Now that you give thanks to see? 

May not you rejoice as I, 
      Seeing the sky 
Change to heaven revealed, and bid 
Earth reveal the heaven it hid 
All night long from stars and moon, 
Now the sun sets all in tune? 

What within you wakes with day 
      Who can say? 
All too little may we tell, 
Friends who like each other well, 
What might haply, if we might, 
Bid us read our lives aright. 



Wild on woodland ways your sires 
      Flashed like fires: 
Fair as flame and fierce and fleet 
As with wings on wingless feet 
Shone and sprang your mother, free, 
Bright and brave as wind or sea. 

Free and proud and glad as they, 
      Here to-day 
Rests or roams their radiant child, 
Vanquished not, but reconciled, 
Free from curb of aught above 
Save the lovely curb of love. 

Love through dreams of souls divine 
      Fain would shine 
Round a dawn whose light and song 
Then should right our mutual wrong -- 
Speak, and seal the love-lit law 
Sweet Assisi's seer foresaw. 

Dreams were theirs; yet haply may 
      Dawn a day 
When such friends and fellows born, 
Seeing our earth as fair at morn, 
May for wiser love's sake see 
More of heaven's deep heart than we.

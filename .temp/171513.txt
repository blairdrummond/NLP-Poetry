 
After experience taught me that all the ordinary   
Surroundings of social life are futile and vain; 

         I'm going to show you something very   
         Ugly: someday, it might save your life. 

Seeing that none of the things I feared contain   
In themselves anything either good or bad 

         What if you get caught without a knife;   
         Nothing--even a loop of piano wire; 

Excepting only in the effect they had   
Upon my mind, I resolved to inquire 

         Take the first two fingers of this hand; 
         Fork them out--kind of a "V for Victory"-- 

Whether there might be something whose discovery   
Would grant me supreme, unending happiness. 

         And jam them into the eyes of your enemy.   
         You have to do this hard. Very hard. Then press 

No virtue can be thought to have priority   
Over this endeavor to preserve one's being. 

         Both fingers down around the cheekbone   
         And setting your foot high into the chest 

No man can desire to act rightly, to be blessed,   
To live rightly, without simultaneously 

         You must call up every strength you own   
         And you can rip off the whole facial mask. 

Wishing to be, to act, to live. He must ask   
First, in other words, to actually exist. 


                           And you, whiner, who wastes your time 
                              Dawdling over the remorseless earth,   
                           What evil, what unspeakable crime 
                              Have you made your life worth?

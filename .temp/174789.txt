 
I travelled among unknown men,
         In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England! did I know till then
         What love I bore to thee.

'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
         Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
         To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
         The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
         Beside an English fire.

Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,
         The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
         That Lucy's eyes surveyed.

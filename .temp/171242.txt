 
Genial poets, pink-faced   
earnest wits-- 
you have given the world   
some choice morsels, 
gobbets of language presented 
as one presents T-bone steak 
and Cherries Jubilee.   
Goodbye, goodbye, 
                            I don't care 
if I never taste your fine food again,   
neutral fellows, seers of every side.   
Tolerance, what crimes 
are committed in your name. 

And you, good women, bakers of nicest bread,   
blood donors. Your crumbs 
choke me, I would not want 
a drop of your blood in me, it is pumped   
by weak hearts, perfect pulses that never   
falter: irresponsive 
to nightmare reality. 

It is my brothers, my sisters, 
whose blood spurts out and stops 
forever 
because you choose to believe it is not your business. 

Goodbye, goodbye, 
your poems 
shut their little mouths,   
your loaves grow moldy,   
a gulf has split 
                     the ground between us, 
and you won't wave, you're looking 
another way. 
We shan't meet again-- 
unless you leap it, leaving   
behind you the cherished   
worms of your dispassion,   
your pallid ironies, 
your jovial, murderous,   
wry-humored balanced judgment, 
leap over, un- 
balanced? ... then 
how our fanatic tears 
would flow and mingle   
for joy ...

 
The ache of marriage: 

thigh and tongue, beloved,   
are heavy with it,   
it throbs in the teeth 

We look for communion 
and are turned away, beloved,   
each and each 

It is leviathan and we   
in its belly 
looking for joy, some joy   
not to be known outside it 

two by two in the ark of   
the ache of it.

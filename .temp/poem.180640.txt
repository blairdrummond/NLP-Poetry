Thou God, whose high, eternal Love 
Is the only blue sky of our life, 
Clear all the Heaven that bends above 
The life-road of this man and wife. 
May these two lives be but one note 
In the world's strange-sounding harmony, 
Whose sacred music e'er shall float 
Through every discord up to Thee. 
As when from separate stars two beams 
Unite to form one tender ray: 
As when two sweet but shadowy dreams 
Explain each other in the day: 
So may these two dear hearts one light 
Emit, and each interpret each. 
Let an angel come and dwell tonight 
In this dear double-heart, and teach.

Were you but lying cold and dead, 
And lights were paling out of the West, 
You would come hither, and bend your head, 
And I would lay my head on your breast; 
And you would murmur tender words, 
Forgiving me, because you were dead: 
Nor would you rise and hasten away, 
Though you have the will of wild birds, 
But know your hair was bound and wound 
About the stars and moon and sun: 
O would, beloved, that you lay 
Under the dock-leaves in the ground, 
While lights were paling one by one.

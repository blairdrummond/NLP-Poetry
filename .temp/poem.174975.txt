I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, 
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed 
That Sense was breaking through - 

And when they all were seated, 
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought 
My mind was going numb - 

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul 
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
And Being, but an Ear, 
And I, and Silence, some strange Race, 
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
And I dropped down, and down - 
And hit a World, at every plunge, 
And Finished knowing - then -

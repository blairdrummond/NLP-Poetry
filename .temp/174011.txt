 
I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs 
       By the known rules of ancient liberty, 
       When straight a barbarous noise environs me 
       Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs: 
As when those hinds that were transform'd to frogs 
       Rail'd at Latona's twin-born progeny 
       Which after held the sun and moon in fee. 
       But this is got by casting pearl to hogs, 
That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood, 
       And still revolt when truth would set them free. 
       Licence they mean when they cry liberty; 
For who loves that, must first be wise and good. 
       But from that mark how far they rove we see, 
       For all this waste of wealth and loss of blood.

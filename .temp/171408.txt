 
for Francis and Barbara


Among the high-branching, leafless boughs   
Above the roof-peaks of the town,   
Snowflakes unnumberably come down. 

I watched out of the attic window   
The laced sway of family trees,   
Intricate genealogies 

Whose strict, reserved gentility,   
Trembling, impossible to bow,   
Received the appalling fall of snow. 

All during Sunday afternoon,   
Not storming, but befittingly,   
Out of a still, grey, devout sky, 

The snowflakes fell, until all shapes 
Went under, and thickening, drunken lines   
Cobwebbed the sleep of solemn pines. 

Up in the attic, among many things   
Inherited and out of style,   
I cried, then fell asleep awhile, 

Waking at night now, as the snow- 
flakes from darkness to darkness go   
Past yellow lights in the street below.

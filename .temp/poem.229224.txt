NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest 
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd 
To sit indulgent, and with him partake 
Rural repast, permitting him the while 
Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change 
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach 
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, 
And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n 
Now alienated, distance and distaste, 
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n, 
That brought into this World a world of woe, 
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie 
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument 
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth 
Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu'd 
Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage 
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd, 
Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long 
Perplex'd the Greek and Cytherea's Son; 
If answerable style I can obtaine 
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes 
Her nightly visitation unimplor'd, 
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires 
Easie my unpremeditated Verse: 
Since first this Subject for Heroic Song 
Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late; 
Not sedulous by Nature to indite 
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument 
Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect 
With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights 
In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude 
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom 
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, 
Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields, 
Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; 
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights 
At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast 
Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; 
The skill of Artifice or Office mean, 
Not that which justly gives Heroic name 
To Person or to Poem.   Mee of these 
Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument 
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise 
That name, unless an age too late, or cold 
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing 
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine, 
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. 

The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr 
Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring 
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter 
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end 
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round: 
When Satan who late fled before the threats 
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd 
In meditated fraud and malice, bent 
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap 
Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd. 
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd 
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, 
Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri'd 
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim 
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n, 
The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode 
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line 
He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night 
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; 
On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse 
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth 
Found unsuspected way.   There was a place, 
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, 
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise 
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part 
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; 
In with the River sunk, and with it rose 
Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought 
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land 
From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole 
Maotis, up beyond the River Ob; 
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length 
West from Orontes to the Ocean barr'd 
At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes 
Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd 
With narrow search; and with inspection deep 
Consider'd every Creature, which of all 
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found 
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. 
Him after long debate, irresolute 
Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose 
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom 
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide 
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, 
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, 
As from his wit and native suttletie 
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd 
Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r 
Active within beyond the sense of brute. 
Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe 
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: 

O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd 
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built 
With second thoughts, reforming what was old! 
For what God after better worse would build? 
Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns 
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, 
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, 
In thee concentring all thir precious beams 
Of sacred influence:   As God in Heav'n 
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou 
Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, 
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers 
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth 
Of Creatures animate with gradual life 
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man. 
With what delight could I have walkt thee round, 
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange 
Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, 
Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd, 
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these 
Find place or refuge; and the more I see 
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel 
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege 
Of contraries; all good to me becomes 
Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state. 
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n 
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame; 
Nor hope to be my self less miserable 
By what I seek, but others to make such 
As I, though thereby worse to me redound: 
For onely in destroying I find ease 
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, 
Or won to what may work his utter loss, 
For whom all this was made, all this will soon 
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, 
In wo then; that destruction wide may range: 
To mee shall be the glorie sole among 
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd 
What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days 
Continu'd making, and who knows how long 
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps 
Not longer then since I in one Night freed 
From servitude inglorious welnigh half 
Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng 
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, 
And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, 
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild 
More Angels to Create, if they at least 
Are his Created, or to spite us more, 
Determin'd to advance into our room 
A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow, 
Exalted from so base original, 
With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed 
He effected; Man he made, and for him built 
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, 
Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie! 
Subjected to his service Angel wings, 
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend 
Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance 
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist 
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie 
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde 
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds 
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. 
O foul descent! that I who erst contended 
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind 
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, 
This essence to incarnate and imbrute, 
That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd; 
But what will not Ambition and Revenge 
Descend to? who aspires must down as low 
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last 
To basest things.   Revenge, at first though sweet, 
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; 
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd, 
Since higher I fall short, on him who next 
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite 
Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, 
Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd 
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. 

So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, 
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on 
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde 
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found 
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld, 
His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: 
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, 
Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe 
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth 
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, 
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd 
With act intelligential, but his sleep 
Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn. 
Now when as sacred Light began to dawne 
In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd 
Thir morning incense, when all things that breath, 
From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise 
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill 
With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair 
And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire 
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake 
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: 
Then commune how that day they best may ply 
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew 
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. 
And Eve first to her Husband thus began. 

Adam, well may we labour still to dress 
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour, 
Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands 
Aid us, the work under our labour grows, 
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day 
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, 
One night or two with wanton growth derides 
Tending to wilde.   Thou therefore now advise 
Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present, 
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice 
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind 
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct 
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I 
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt 
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: 
For while so near each other thus all day 
Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near 
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new 
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits 
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun 
Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. 

To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. 
Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond 
Compare above all living Creatures deare, 
Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd 
How we might best fulfill the work which here 
God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass 
Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found 
In Woman, then to studie houshold good, 
And good workes in her Husband to promote. 
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd 
Labour, as to debarr us when we need 
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, 
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse 
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, 
To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, 
Love not the lowest end of human life. 
For not to irksom toile, but to delight 
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. 
These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands 
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide 
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long 
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps 
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield. 
For solitude somtimes is best societie, 
And short retirement urges sweet returne. 
But other doubt possesses me, least harm 
Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst 
What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe 
Envying our happiness, and of his own 
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame 
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand 
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find 
His wish and best advantage, us asunder, 
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each 
To other speedie aide might lend at need; 
Whether his first design be to withdraw 
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb 
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss 
Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; 
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side 
That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. 
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, 
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, 
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. 

To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, 
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, 
With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd, 

Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, 
That such an Enemie we have, who seeks 
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, 
And from the parting Angel over-heard 
As in a shadie nook I stood behind, 
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. 
But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt 
To God or thee, because we have a foe 
May tempt it, I expected not to hear. 
His violence thou fearst not, being such, 
As wee, not capable of death or paine, 
Can either not receave, or can repell. 
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs 
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love 
Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; 
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest 
Adam, missthought of her to thee so dear? 

To whom with healing words Adam replyd. 
Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, 
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: 
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade 
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid 
Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. 
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses 
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd 
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff 
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne 
And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, 
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, 
If such affront I labour to avert 
From thee alone, which on us both at once 
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, 
Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. 
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; 
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce 
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. 
I from the influence of thy looks receave 
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight 
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were 
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, 
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht 
Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. 
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel 
When I am present, and thy trial choose 
With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. 

So spake domestick Adam in his care 
And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought 
Less attributed to her Faith sincere, 
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. 

If this be our condition, thus to dwell 
In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, 
Suttle or violent, we not endu'd 
Single with like defence, wherever met, 
How are we happie, still in fear of harm? 
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe 
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem 
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme 
Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns 
Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard 
By us? who rather double honour gaine 
From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within, 
Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. 
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid 
Alone, without exterior help sustaind? 
Let us not then suspect our happie State 
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, 
As not secure to single or combin'd. 
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, 
And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. 

To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. 
O Woman, best are all things as the will 
Of God ordain'd them, his creating hand 
Nothing imperfet or deficient left 
Of all that he Created, much less Man, 
Or aught that might his happie State secure, 
Secure from outward force; within himself 
The danger lies, yet lies within his power: 
Against his will he can receave no harme. 
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes 
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, 
But bid her well beware, and still erect, 
Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd 
She dictate false, and misinforme the Will 
To do what God expressly hath forbid. 
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, 
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. 
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, 
Since Reason not impossibly may meet 
Some specious object by the Foe subornd, 
And fall into deception unaware, 
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. 
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide 
Were better, and most likelie if from mee 
Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. 
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve 
First thy obedience; th' other who can know, 
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? 
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde 
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, 
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; 
Go in thy native innocence, relie 
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, 
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. 
So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve 
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. 

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd 
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words 
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, 
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, 
The willinger I goe, nor much expect 
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; 
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. 
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand 
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light 
Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, 
Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self 
In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, 
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, 
But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude, 
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought. 
To Pales, or Pomona thus adornd, 
Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled 
Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, 
Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. 
Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd 
Delighted, but desiring more her stay. 
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne 
Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd 
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, 
And all things in best order to invite 
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. 
O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, 
Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! 
Thou never from that houre in Paradise 
Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; 
Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades 
Waited with hellish rancour imminent 
To intercept thy way, or send thee back 
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. 
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, 
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, 
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde 
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them 
The whole included Race, his purposd prey. 
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft 
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, 
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, 
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet 
He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find 
Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope 
Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, 
Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, 
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, 
Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round 
About her glowd, oft stooping to support 
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay 
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, 
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies 
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, 
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, 
From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. 
Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd 
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, 
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen 
Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours 
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: 
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd 
Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd 
Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, 
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King 
Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. 
Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. 
As one who long in populous City pent, 
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, 
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe 
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes 
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, 
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, 
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; 
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, 
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, 
She most, and in her look summs all Delight. 
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold 
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve 
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme 
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, 
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire 
Of gesture or lest action overawd 
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd 
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: 
That space the Evil one abstracted stood 
From his own evil, and for the time remaind 
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, 
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; 
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, 
Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, 
And tortures him now more, the more he sees 
Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon 
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts 
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. 

Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet 
Compulsion thus transported to forget 
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope 
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste 
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, 
Save what is in destroying, other joy 
To me is lost.   Then let me not let pass 
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone 
The Woman, opportune to all attempts, 
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, 
Whose higher intellectual more I shun, 
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb 
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, 
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, 
I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine 
Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. 
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, 
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love 
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, 
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, 
The way which to her ruin now I tend. 

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd 
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve 
Address'd his way, not with indented wave, 
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, 
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd 
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head 
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; 
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect 
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass 
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, 
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind 
Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd 
Hermione and Cadmus, or the God 
In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd 
Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, 
Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore 
Scipio the highth of Rome.   With tract oblique 
At first, as one who sought access, but feard 
To interrupt, side-long he works his way. 
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought 
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind 
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; 
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine 
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, 
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound 
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd 
To such disport before her through the Field, 
From every Beast, more duteous at her call, 
Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. 
Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; 
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd 
His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, 
Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. 
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length 
The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad 
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue 
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, 
His fraudulent temptation thus began. 

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps 
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm 
Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, 
Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze 
Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard 
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. 
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, 
Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine 
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore 
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld 
Where universally admir'd; but here 
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, 
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne 
Half what in thee is fair, one man except, 
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen 
A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd 
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. 

So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; 
Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, 
Though at the voice much marveling; at length 
Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. 
What may this mean?   Language of Man pronounc't 
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? 
The first at lest of these I thought deni'd 
To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day 
Created mute to all articulat sound; 
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks 
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. 
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field 
I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; 
Redouble then this miracle, and say, 
How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how 
To me so friendly grown above the rest 
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? 
Say, for such wonder claims attention due. 

To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. 
Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, 
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all 
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: 
I was at first as other Beasts that graze 
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, 
As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd 
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: 
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd 
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold 
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, 
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; 
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, 
Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense 
Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats 
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, 
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. 
To satisfie the sharp desire I had 
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd 
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, 
Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent 
Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. 
About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon, 
For high from ground the branches would require 
Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree 
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire 
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. 
Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung 
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill 
I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour 
At Feed or Fountain never had I found. 
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave 
Strange alteration in me, to degree 
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech 
Wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd. 
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep 
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind 
Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, 
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; 
But all that fair and good in thy Divine 
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray 
United I beheld; no Fair to thine 
Equivalent or second, which compel'd 
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come 
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd 
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. 

So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve 
Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. 

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt 
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: 
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? 
For many are the Trees of God that grow 
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown 
To us, in such aboundance lies our choice, 
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, 
Still hanging incorruptible, till men 
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands 
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. 

To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. 
Empress, the way is readie, and not long, 
Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, 
Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past 
Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept 
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. 

Lead then, said Eve.   Hee leading swiftly rowld 
In tangles, and made intricate seem strait, 
To mischief swift.   Hope elevates, and joy 
Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire, 
Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night 
Condenses, and the cold invirons round, 
Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, 
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends 
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, 
Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way 
To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole, 
There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. 
So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud 
Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree 
Of prohibition, root of all our woe; 
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. 

Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, 
Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess, 
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, 
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. 
But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; 
God so commanded, and left that Command 
Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live 
Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. 

To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. 
Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit 
Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, 
Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? 

To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit 
Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, 
But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst 
The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate 
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. 

She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold 
The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love 
To Man, and indignation at his wrong, 
New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, 
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act 
Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. 
As when of old som Orator renound 
In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence 
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, 
Stood in himself collected, while each part, 
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, 
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay 
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. 
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown 
The Tempter all impassiond thus began. 

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, 
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power 
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne 
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes 
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. 
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe 
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: 
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life 
To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, 
Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, 
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate 
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. 
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast 
Is open? or will God incense his ire 
For such a petty Trespass, and not praise 
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain 
Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, 
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade 
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; 
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil 
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? 
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; 
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd: 
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. 
Why then was this forbid?   Why but to awe, 
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, 
His worshippers; he knows that in the day 
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, 
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then 
Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, 
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. 
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, 
Internal Man, is but proportion meet, 
I of brute human, yee of human Gods. 
So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off 
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, 
Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring. 
And what are Gods that Man may not become 
As they, participating God-like food? 
The Gods are first, and that advantage use 
On our belief, that all from them proceeds; 
I question it, for this fair Earth I see, 
Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, 
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd 
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, 
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains 
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies 
Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? 
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree 
Impart against his will if all be his? 
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell 
In heav'nly breasts? these, these and many more 
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. 
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. 

He ended, and his words replete with guile 
Into her heart too easie entrance won: 
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold 
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound 
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd 
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; 
Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd 
An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell 
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, 
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, 
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first 
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. 

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, 
Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir'd, 
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay 
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught 
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: 
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, 
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree 
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; 
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding 
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good 
By thee communicated, and our want: 
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had 
And yet unknown, is as not had at all. 
In plain then, what forbids he but to know, 
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? 
Such prohibitions binde not.   But if Death 
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then 
Our inward freedom?   In the day we eate 
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. 
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, 
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, 
Irrational till then.   For us alone 
Was death invented? or to us deni'd 
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? 
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first 
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy 
The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, 
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. 
What fear I then, rather what know to feare 
Under this ignorance of good and Evil, 
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? 
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, 
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, 
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then 
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? 

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour 
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: 
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat 
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, 
That all was lost.   Back to the Thicket slunk 
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve 
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else 
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, 
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true 
Or fansied so, through expectation high 
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. 
Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, 
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, 
And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, 
Thus to her self she pleasingly began. 

O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees 
In Paradise, of operation blest 
To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, 
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end 
Created; but henceforth my early care, 
Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise 
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease 
Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; 
Till dieted by thee I grow mature 
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; 
Though others envie what they cannot give; 
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here 
Thus grown.   Experience, next to thee I owe, 
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind 
In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, 
And giv'st access, though secret she retire. 
And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, 
High and remote to see from thence distinct 
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps 
May have diverted from continual watch 
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies 
About him.   But to Adam in what sort 
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known 
As yet my change, and give him to partake 
Full happiness with mee, or rather not, 
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power 
Without Copartner? so to add what wants 
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, 
And render me more equal, and perhaps, 
A thing not undesireable, somtime 
Superior; for inferior who is free? 
This may be well: but what if God have seen, 
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, 
And Adam wedded to another Eve, 
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; 
A death to think.   Confirm'd then I resolve; 
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: 
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths 
I could endure, without him live no life. 

So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, 
But first low Reverence don, as to the power 
That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd 
Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd 
From Nectar, drink of Gods.   Adam the while 
Waiting desirous her return, had wove 
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne 
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown, 
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. 
Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new 
Solace in her return, so long delay'd; 
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, 
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; 
And forth to meet her went, the way she took 
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree 
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, 
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand 
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, 
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. 
To him she hasted, in her face excuse 
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, 
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. 

Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? 
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd 
Thy presence, agonie of love till now 
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more 
Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, 
The pain of absence from thy sight.   But strange 
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: 
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree 
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown 
Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect 
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; 
And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise, 
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, 
Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, 
Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth 
Endu'd with human voice and human sense, 
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee 
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I 
Have also tasted, and have also found 
Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, 
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, 
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee 
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. 
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, 
Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. 
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot 
May joyne us, equal joy, as equal Love; 
Least thou not tasting, different degree 
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce 
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. 

Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; 
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. 
On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard 
The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, 
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill 
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; 
From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve 
Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: 
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length 
First to himself he inward silence broke. 

O fairest of Creation, last and best 
Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell'd 
Whatever can to sight or thought be formd, 
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! 
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, 
Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? 
Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress 
The strict forbiddance, how to violate 
The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud 
Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, 
And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee 
Certain my resolution is to Die; 
How can I live without thee, how forgoe 
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, 
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? 
Should God create another Eve, and I 
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee 
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel 
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, 
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State 
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. 
So having said, as one from sad dismay 
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd 
Submitting to what seemd remediless, 
Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd. 

Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, 
And peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd 
Had it been onely coveting to Eye 
That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, 
Much more to taste it under banne to touch. 
But past who can recall, or don undoe? 
Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so 
Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact 
Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, 
Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first 
Made common and unhallowd ere our taste; 
Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, 
Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man 
Higher degree of Life, inducement strong 
To us, as likely tasting to attaine 
Proportional ascent, which cannot be 
But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. 
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, 
Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy 
Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, 
Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, 
For us created, needs with us must faile, 
Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, 
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, 
Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power 
Creation could repeate, yet would be loath 
Us to abolish, least the Adversary 
Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God 
Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first 
He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? 
Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe, 
However I with thee have fixt my Lot, 
Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death 
Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; 
So forcible within my beart I feel 
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, 
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; 
Our State cannot be severd, we are one, 
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. 

So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. 
O glorious trial of exceeding Love, 
Illustrious evidence, example high! 
Ingaging me to emulate, but short 
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, 
Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, 
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, 
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff 
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, 
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread 
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, 
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, 
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, 
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, 
Direct, or by occasion hath presented 
This happie trial of thy Love, which else 
So eminently never had bin known. 
Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue 
This my attempt, I would sustain alone 
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die 
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact 
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd 
Remarkably so late of thy so true, 
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel 
Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life 
Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, 
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before 
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. 
On my experience, Adam, freely taste, 
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. 

So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy 
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love 
Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr 
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. 
In recompence (for such compliance bad 
Such recompence best merits) from the bough 
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit 
With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat 
Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, 
But fondly overcome with Femal charm. 
Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again 
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, 
Skie lowr'd and muttering Thunder, som sad drops 
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin 
Original; while Adam took no thought, 
Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate 
Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe 
Him with her lov'd societie, that now 
As with new Wine intoxicated both 
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel 
Divinitie within them breeding wings 
Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit 
Farr other operation first displaid, 
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve 
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him 
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: 
Till Adam thus'gan Eve to dalliance move, 

Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, 
And elegant, of Sapience no small part, 
Since to each meaning savour we apply, 
And Palate call judicious; I the praise 
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. 
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd 
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now 
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be 
In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, 
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. 
But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, 
As meet is, after such delicious Fare; 
For never did thy Beautie since the day 
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd 
With all perfections, so enflame my sense 
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now 
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. 

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy 
Of amorous intent, well understood 
Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. 
Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, 
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd 
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, 
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, 
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. 
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport 
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, 
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep 
Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. 
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, 
That with exhilerating vapour bland 
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers 
Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep 
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams 
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose 
As from unrest, and each the other viewing, 
Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds 
How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile 
Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, 
Just confidence, and native righteousness 
And honour from about them, naked left 
To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe 
Uncover'd more, so rose the Danite strong 
Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap 
Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd 
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare 
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face 
Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, 
Till Adam, though not less then Eve abash't, 
At length gave utterance to these words constraind. 

Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare 
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught 
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, 
False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes 
Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know 
Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got, 
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, 
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, 
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, 
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, 
And in our Faces evident the signes 
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; 
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first 
Be sure then.   How shall I behold the face 
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy 
And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes 
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze 
Insufferably bright.   O might I here 
In solitude live savage, in some glade 
Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable 
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad 
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, 
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs 
Hide me, where I may never see them more. 
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise 
What best may from the present serve to hide 
The Parts of each for other, that seem most 
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, 
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, 
And girded on our loyns, may cover round 
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, 
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. 

So counsel'd hee, and both together went 
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose 
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, 
But such as at this day to Indians known 
In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes 
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground 
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow 
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade 
High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; 
There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate 
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds 
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves 
They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, 
And with what skill they had, together sowd, 
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide 
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike 
To that first naked Glorie.   Such of late 
Columbus found th' American so girt 
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde 
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. 
Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part 
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, 
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares 
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within 
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, 
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore 
Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once 
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: 
For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will 
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now 
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe 
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd 
Superior sway: from thus distemperd brest, 
Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, 
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. 

Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, and stai'd 
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange 
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, 
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then 
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild 
Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. 
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve 
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek 
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. 

To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. 
What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, 
Imput'st thou that to my default, or will 
Of wandring, as thou call'st it, which who knows 
But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, 
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there, 
Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd 
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; 
No ground of enmitie between us known, 
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme, 
Was I to have never parted from thy side? 
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. 
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head 
Command me absolutely not to go, 
Going into such danger as thou saidst? 
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, 
Nay didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. 
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, 
Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. 

To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd, 
Is this the Love, is this the recompence 
Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest 
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, 
Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, 
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: 
And am I now upbraided, as the cause 
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, 
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? 
I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold 
The danger, and the lurking Enemie 
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, 
And force upon free will hath here no place. 
But confidence then bore thee on, secure 
Either to meet no danger, or to finde 
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps 
I also err'd in overmuch admiring 
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought 
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue 
That errour now, which is become my crime, 
And thou th' accuser.   Thus it shall befall 
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting 
Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook, 
And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, 
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. 

Thus they in mutual accusation spent 
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning, 
And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.

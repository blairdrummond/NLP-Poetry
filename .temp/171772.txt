 
eviction people arrive to haunt me 
      with descriptions of summer's wildflowers   
            how they are carpet of fierce colors 

I bet you hate to see us they say and yes 
      I do hate to have to move again especially from here   
            destruction brought to place of love 

the uneven smiles that win she's a business woman   
      blond tints that glow at sunset as profits rise   
            alas what labor I employ 

but to ensure a moment's joy 
      sets branches trembling & arms chilled   
            dear one long returning home, come to 

clammy feverish details, muffed sorrow 
      I turn to throw a tear of rage in the pot 
            never remorse but hint of scruples I'd hope for 

it is error it is speculation it is real estate 
      it is the villain and comic slippery words 
            the work of despotic wills to make money 

I scream take it take your money! make your money   
      go on it's only money, here's a wall of dry rot 
            here's an unfinished ceiling, just a little sunlight 

peeks through this (lark, no luminance! exquisite St. Etienne   
      stove doesn't work icebox either too hot or frozen   
            firescreen tumbling down 

kitchen insulation droops is ugly & a mess 
      ah but love it here, only surface appearances   
            to complain of, nothing does justice 

to shape of actual events I love   
      but a fight against artificiality 
            its inherent antagonism, bald hatred of moving 

and problem of thirsty fig tree in Burroughs 
      apartment wakes me I don't want to go down there yet   
            & how to orchestrate the summer properly 

the problem of distress & not denying pride from it   
      too atomized to make pleasure of melancholy 
            & an uncontrollable enthusiasm for throne & altar 

I want to sit high want simple phalanx 
      of power independent of everything but free will   
            & one long hymn in praise of the cabin! 

it is a confession in me impenetrably walled in   
      like aesthetics like cosmos an organ of 
            metaphysics and O this book gives me a headache 

dear Weston La Barre let's have an argument   
      because I see too clearly how rational I must be &   
            the kernel of my faith corrupted 

because you have no reliance on the shaman & outlaw   
      or how depth of mind might be staggering   
            everywhere except in how important science is 

science? no he won't he fooled by visions 
      whereas I wait for dazzling UFOs they announce   
            will arrive high in these mountains 

I repair the portal even invite stray horses in   
      have a little toy receiving station   
            that sits by the bed 

at the edge of night all thoughts to place of love   
      all worries to this place of love   
            all gestures to the place of love 

all agonies to place of love, thaws to place   
      of love, swarthy valley sealed   
            in wood, log burst into flame 

in home of love, all heart's dints   
      and machinations, all bellows & pungency   
            antemundane thoughts to palace of love 

all liberties, singularity, all imaginings 
      I weep for, Jack's sweet almond-eyed daughter to   
            place of love, & heavy blankets 

and terracing & yard work & patch work   
      & tenacity & the best in you 
            surround me work in me to place my love 

dear cirques, clear constraint, dissenting 
      inclinations of a man and a woman, Metonic cycle   
            all that sweats in rooms, lives in nature 

requiems & momentum & trimmings of bushes   
      dried hibiscus & hawks & shyness   
            brought to this place of love 

trees rooted fear rooted all roots brought 
      to place of love, mystery to heart of love   
            & fibers 

and fibers in sphere of love a whole world makes   
      spectators of slow flowering of spring 
            & summer when you walk to town for eggs 

and continuous hammerings as new people   
      arrive & today we notice for first time 
            a white-crowned sparrow out by the feeder 

with the chickadees & juncos & I missed   
      that airplane-dinosaur in dream nervous   
            to travel again, miss buds pop open 

to shudder in breeze, their tractability   
      makes sudden rise of sensibility you are   
            shuddering too & your boy laugh 

comes less frequent now you're drawn into   
      accountability, will I return to find all   
            stuff tidy in silver truck 

ready to go? it's you in this place I lose   
      most because it's here in you I forget 
            where I am, this place for supernaturals 

perched high in sky & wind, held by wind in stationary   
      motion as bluebird we observe over meadow or caught   
            up with jetstream dipping in valley's soft cradle 

power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes 
      power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes to   
            make it work while 

down there someone building replicas of what 
      it feels like to be a human multitude, fantasy   
            molded clumsily, spare my loves 

and love of glorious architecture when you really put   
      outside in, the feeling of cloud or mountain   
            or stone 

having developed an idea of idyllic private life   
      & sovereignty of spirit over common   
            empirical demand 

I tell you about renunciation, I tell you holy   
      isolation like a river nears ocean to   
            dissolve 

and cabin becomes someone's idea of a good place   
      discretion you pay for it wasn't mine either   
            but sits on me imprints on me 

forever splendor of fog, snow shut strangers out   
      gradual turn of season, ground stir, pine 
            needle tickle your shoulder, peak curve, fresh air.

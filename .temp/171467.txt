 
Snow hurries 
the strawberries 
from the bush. 
Star-wet water rides   
you into summer,   
into my autumn. 
Your cactus hands   
are at my heart again.   
Lady, I court 
my dream of you 
in lilies and in rain.   
I vest myself 
in your oldest memory   
and in my oldest need.   
And in my passion 
you are the deepest blue   
of the oldest rose.   
Star circle me an axe.   
I cannot cut myself 
from any of your emblems.   
It will soon be cold here, 
and dark here; 
the grass will lie flat 
to search for its spring head. 
I will bow again 
in the winter of your eyes. 
If there is music, 
it will be the weather's bells 
to call me to the abandoned chapel 
of your simple body.

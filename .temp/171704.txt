 
The messenger runs, not carrying the news 
 of victory, or defeat; the messenger, unresting, 
   has always been running, the wind before and behind him, 
    across the turning back of earth, leaving 
      his tracks across the plains, his ropes 
       hanging from the ledges of mountains; 
         for centuries, millennia, he has been running 
       carrying whatever it is that cannot be 
      put down: it is rolled in a tube 
    made of hide, carefully, to keep it dry 
   as he runs, through storms and monsoons, 
sometimes on foot, sometimes poling a boat   
 through a flooded mangrove swamp, or   
   setting stiff sails to cross from island to island 
    running before the wind. In some ages, peasants 
      have helped him--bringing him small cakes 
       of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and 
         new sandals woven of hemp for his torn 
       bleeding feet; sometimes in the heat of noon 
      they would offer a drink of rosewater, sometimes 
   a coat of fur against the winter snows;   
and sometimes at night, he would rest 
 by a fire where voices wove with the music 
   of gut-strings, or with mountain pipes whose 
    sound was like wind through the bones 
      of creation--and he would be cheered 
       by the company of others, the firelit glow 
         of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark; 
       at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars 
      analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle; 
   but at dawn, he always arose, in the mists, 
in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes 
 worn into scraps and discarded, so many   
   the cities that burned as he passed 
    them, so many the skulls abandoned 
      by armies, so many whose blood 
       stained the threads of their prayer rugs,   
         so many, so many, so many-- 
      oh, 
    and that green, sunlit hill that kept 
   rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright   
 against the sky, the odds, the evidence-- 
and he, the messenger, 
 running through history, carries this small tube, 
   its durable hide--carries it, not like   
    a torch, no, nothing so blazing; 
      not like the brass lamp that summons 
       a genie, no magic wishes; 
      not like the candles that hope sets aflame 
    and a breath can extinguish ... 

no. 
 He carried it like 
   what has no likeness, 
    what is curled up inside and 
      he swore he could feel it, though 
       perhaps he had dreamed it, still 
         at times, stopping under some tree 
       or other, when the night was warm, 
      so close the stars seemed to breathe in   
   the branches, he would lie quiet,   
 then it would seem 
that whatever it was in there 
 would pulse softly with light, a code   
   only the heart could break 
    (but of course he couldn't say 
      for he was only the messenger)-- 
    and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise   
      to his feet and trudge on, sometimes   
       running, sometimes stumbling, 
         carrying whatever it was that could not 
          be put down, would not be cast aside-- 
         and besides, he would chide himself,   
       weren't they all as tired as he, 
      and hadn't they helped him, time 
    and again, on his way?

 
In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see 
                                           the people of the world   
       exactly at the moment when 
             they first attained the title of 
                                                             'suffering humanity'   
          They writhe upon the page 
                                        in a veritable rage 
                                                                of adversity   
          Heaped up 
                     groaning with babies and bayonets 
                                                       under cement skies   
            in an abstract landscape of blasted trees 
                  bent statues bats wings and beaks 
                               slippery gibbets 
                  cadavers and carnivorous cocks 
            and all the final hollering monsters 
                  of the 
                           'imagination of disaster' 
            they are so bloody real 
                                        it is as if they really still existed 

    And they do 

                  Only the landscape is changed 

 They still are ranged along the roads   
          plagued by legionnaires 
                     false windmills and demented roosters 
 They are the same people 
                                     only further from home 
      on freeways fifty lanes wide 
                              on a concrete continent 
                                        spaced with bland billboards   
                        illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness 


                        The scene shows fewer tumbrils 
                                                but more strung-out citizens 
                                                                     in painted cars 
                               and they have strange license plates   
                           and engines 
                                           that devour America

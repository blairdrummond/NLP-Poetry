 
When he was my age and I was already a boy   
my father made a machine in the garage.   
A wired piece of steel 
with many small and beautiful welds 
ground so smooth they resembled rows of pearls. 

He went broke with whatever it was.   
He held it so carefully in his arms.   
He carried it foundry to foundry.   
I think it was his harp, 
I think it was what he longed to make   
with his hands for the world. 

He moved it finally from the locked closet   
to the bedroom 
to the garage again 
where he hung it on the wall 
until I climbed and pulled it down 
and rubbed it clean 
and tried to make it work.

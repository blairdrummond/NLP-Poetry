 
I owe you an explanation. 
My first memory isn't your own 
of an empty box. My babyhood cabinets held   
a countlessness of cakes, my backyard 
rotted into apple glut, windfalls of 
money-tree, mouthfuls of fib. 

At puberty I liked the locks, 
I was the one who made them fast.   
The yelling in our hallways was about 
lost money, or lost love, but not   
lost life. Or so I see it now:   
in those days I romanticized   
a risk (I thought I'd die   
in the alcoholic automobile, die 
at the hands of nerveless dentistry). Small hearts 
were printed in the checkbook; when my parents called me   
dear, they meant expensive. 

Where were you in all that time? Out looking for   
your father's body? Making for your mother's room?   
I got my A's in English, civics, 
sweetness and light; you got black eyes, and F's,   
and nowhere fast. By 1967 when we met   
(if you could call it making an acquaintance,   
rape) I was a mal-adjusted gush, a sucker for 
placebos. Walking home from Central Square, I came to have   
the good girl's petty dread: the woman 

to whose yard you dragged me might 
detect us, and be furious. More than anything else   
I wanted no one mad at me. (Propriety, 
or was it property, I thought 
to guard: myself I gave away.) 

And as for you, you had the shakes,   
were barely seventeen yourself, too raw   
to get it up (I said don't be afraid, 
afraid of what might happen if you failed). 
And afterwards, in one of those moments 
it's hard to tell (funny from fatal) you did 
a terrible civility: you told me 

thanks. I'll never forget 
that moment all my life. 
It wasn't until then, as you 
were sheathing it to run, 

I saw the knife.

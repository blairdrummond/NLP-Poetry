 
Sometimes up out of this land   
a legend begins to move. 
Is it a coming near 
of something under love? 

Love is of the earth only,   
the surface, a map of roads   
leading wherever go miles   
or little bushes nod. 

Not so the legend under,   
fixed, inexorable, 
deep as the darkest mine   
the thick rocks won't tell. 

As fire burns the leaf 
and out of the green appears   
the vein in the center line 
and the legend veins under there, 

So, the world happens twice-- 
once what we see it as; 
second it legends itself 
deep, the way it is.

 
The time of youth is to be spent
But vice in it should be forfent.

Pastimes there be, I nought truly,
Which one may use and vice deny.

And they be pleasant to God and man,
Those should we covet, win who can,

As feats of arms and such other
Whereby activeness one may utter.

Comparisons in them may lawfully be set,
For thereby courage is surely out fet.

Virtue it is then youth for to spend
In good disports which it doth fend.

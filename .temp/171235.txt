 
I thought I was growing wings-- 
it was a cocoon. 

I thought, now is the time to step   
into the fire-- 
it was deep water. 

Eschatology is a word I learned 
as a child: the study of Last Things; 

facing my mirror--no longer young, 
       the news--always of death, 
       the dogs--rising from sleep and clamoring   
            and howling, howling, 

nevertheless 
I see for a moment   
that's not it: it is   
the First Things. 

Word after word 
floats through the glass.   
Towards me.

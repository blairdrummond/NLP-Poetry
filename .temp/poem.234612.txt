               The Turn 

Brave infant of Saguntum, clear 
Thy coming forth in that great year, 
When the prodigious Hannibal did crown 
His rage with razing your immortal town. 
Thou, looking then about, 
Ere thou wert half got out, 
Wise child, didst hastily return, 
And mad'st thy mother's womb thine urn. 
How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind   
Of deepest lore, could we the center find! 

               The Counterturn 

Did wiser Nature draw thee back 
From out the horror of that sack, 
Where shame, faith, honor, and regard of right 
Lay trampled on; the deeds of death and night 
Urged, hurried forth, and hurled 
Upon th' affrighted world; 
Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met, 
And all on utmost ruin set, 
As, could they but life's miseries foresee, 
No doubt all infants would return like thee? 

               The Stand 

For what is life, if measured by the space, 
Not by the act? 
Or masked man, if valued by his face 
Above his fact? 
Here's one outlived his peers 
And told forth fourscore years; 
He vexed time and busied the whole state, 
Troubled both foes and friends; 
But ever to no ends: 
What did this stirrer but die late? 
How well at twenty had he fall'n or stood! 
For three of his fourscore he did no good. 

               The Turn 

He entered well, by virtuous parts, 
Got up and thrived with honest arts; 
He purchased friends, and fame, and honors then, 
And had his noble name advanced with men; 
But weary of that flight 
He stooped in all men's sight 
To sordid flatteries, acts of strife, 
And sunk in that dead sea of life 
So deep, as he did then death's waters sup, 
But that the cork of title buoyed him up. 

               The Counterturn 

Alas, but Morison fell young; 
He never fell, thou fall'st, my tongue. 
He stood, a soldier to the last right end, 
A perfect patriot, and a noble friend, 
But most a virtuous son. 
All offices were done 
By him so ample, full, and round, 
In weight, in measure, number, sound, 
As, though his age imperfect might appear, 
His life was of humanity the sphere. 

               The Stand 

Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears, 
And make them years; 
Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage   
To swell thin age; 
Repeat of things a throng, 
To show thou hast been long, 
Not lived; for life doth her great actions spell 
By what was done and wrought 
In season, and so brought 
To light: her measures are, how well 
Each syllabe answered, and was formed how fair; 
These make the lines of life, and that's her air. 

               The Turn 

It is not growing like a tree 
In bulk doth make man better be; 
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year, 
To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere: 
A lily of a day 
Is fairer far in May; 
Although it fall and die that night, 
It was the plant and flower of light. 
In small proportions we just beauties see, 
And in short measures life may perfect be. 

               The Counterturn 

Call, noble Lucius, then for wine, 
And let thy looks with gladness shine; 
Accept this garland, plant it on thy head, 
And think, nay know, thy Morison's not dead. 
He leaped the present age, 
Possessed with holy rage 
To see that bright eternal day; 
Of which we priests and poets say 
Such truths as we expect for happy men, 
And there he lives with memory, and Ben 

               The Stand 

Jonson! who sung thus of him, ere he went 
Himself to rest, 
Or taste a part of that full joy he meant   
To have expressed   
In this bright asterism; 
Where it were friendship's schism 
(Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry) 
To separate these twi- 
Lights, the Dioscuri, 
And keep the one half from his Harry. 
But fate doth so alternate the design, 
Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine. 

               The Turn 

And shine as you exalted are, 
Two names of friendship, but one star: 
Of hearts the union. And those not by chance 
Made, or indenture, or leased out t'advance 
The profits for a time. 
No pleasures vain did chime 
Of rimes, or riots, at your feasts, 
Orgies of drink, or feigned protests, 
But simple love of greatness and of good; 
That knits brave minds and manners more than blood. 

               The Counterturn 

This made you first to know the why 
You liked, then after to apply 
That liking, and approach so one the tother, 
Till either grew a portion of the other: 
Each styled by his end 
The copy of his friend. 
You lived to be the great surnames 
And titles by which all made claims 
Unto the virtue. Nothing perfect done, 
But as a Cary, or a Morison. 

               The Stand 

And such a force the fair example had, 
As they that saw 
The good, and durst not practice it, were glad 
That such a law 
Was left yet to mankind; 
Where they might read and find 
Friendship, indeed, was written, not in words; 
And with the heart, not pen, 
Of two so early men, 
Whose lines her rolls were, and records, 
Who, ere the first down bloomed on the chin, 
Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.

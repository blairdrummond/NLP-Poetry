 
I waited and worked
    To win myself leisure,
Till loneliness irked
    And I turned to raw pleasure.

I drank and I gamed,
    I feasted and wasted, 
Till, sick and ashamed,
    The food stood untasted.

I searched in the Book
    For rooted convictions,
Till the badgered brain shook 
    With its own contradictions.

Then, done with the speech, 
    Of the foolishly lettered, 
I started to teach
    Life cannot be bettered:

That the warrior fails
    Whatever his weapon,
And nothing avails
    While time and chance happen.

That fools who assure men
    With lies are respected, 
While the vision of pure men
    Is scorned and rejected.

That a wise man goes grieving 
    Even in Zion,
While any dog living 
    Outroars a dead lion.

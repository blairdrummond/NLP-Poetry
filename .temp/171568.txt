 
The galloping collection of boards   
are the house which I afforded   
one evening to walk into 
just as the night came down. 

Dark inside, the candle 
lit of its own free will, the attic   
groaned then, the stairs 
led me up into the air. 

From outside, it must have seemed   
a wonder that it was 
the inside he as me saw 
in the dark there.

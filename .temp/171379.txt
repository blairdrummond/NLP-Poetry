 
"Is there no balm in Gilead?" So cries   
dour Jeremiah in granite tones.   
"There is a balm in Gilead," replies   
a Negro spiritual. The baritone 

who chants it, leaning forward on the platform,   
looks up, not knowing his voice is a rainstorm   
that rinses air to reveal earth's surprises. 
Today, the summer gone, four monarch butterflies, 

their breed's survivors, sucked a flower's last blooms,   
opened their wings, orange-and-black stained glass,   
and printed on the sky in zigzag lines, 
watch bright things rise: winter moons, the white undersides   
of a California condor, once thought doomed, 
now flapping wide like the first bird from ashes.

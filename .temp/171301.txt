 
Fear. Three bears 
are not fear, mother 
and cubs come berrying   
in our neighborhood 

like any other family. 
I want to see them, or any   
distraction. Flashlight   
poking across the brook 

into briary darkness,   
but they have gone, 
noisily. I go to bed.   
Fear. Unwritten books 

already titled. Some 
idiot will shoot the bears 
soon, it always happens, 
they'll be strung up by the paws 

in someone's frontyard   
maple to be admired and   
measured, and I'll be paid   
for work yet to be done-- 

with a broken imagination.   
At last I dream. Our 
plum tree, little, black,   
twisted, gaunt in the 

orchard: how for a moment   
last spring it flowered 
serenely, translucently 
before yielding its usual 

summer crop of withered   
leaves. I waken, late,   
go to the window, look   
down to the orchard. 

Is middle age what makes   
even dreams factual? 
The plum is serene and   
bright in new moonlight, 

dressed in silver leaves, 
and nearby, in the waste 
of rough grass strewn 
in moonlight like diamond dust, 

what is it?--a dark shape   
moves, and then another.   
Are they ... I can't 
be sure. The dark house 

nuzzles my knee mutely,   
pleading for meaty dollars.   
Fear. Wouldn't it be great   
to write nothing at all 

except poems about bears?

Felix Randal the farrier, O is he dead then? my duty all ended, 
Who have watched his mould of man, big-boned and hardy-handsome 
Pining, pining, till time when reason rambled in it, and some 
Fatal four disorders, fleshed there, all contended? 

Sickness broke him. Impatient, he cursed at first, but mended 
Being anointed and all; though a heavenlier heart began some 
Months earlier, since I had our sweet reprieve and ransom 
Tendered to him. Ah well, God rest him all road ever he offended! 

This seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it endears. 
My tongue had taught thee comfort, touch had quenched thy tears, 
Thy tears that touched my heart, child, Felix, poor Felix Randal; 

How far from then forethought of, all thy more boisterous years, 
When thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers,
Didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!

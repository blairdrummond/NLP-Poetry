 
Though some saith that youth ruleth me,
      I trust in age to tarry.
God and my right and my duty,
      From them I shall never vary,
      Though some say that youth ruleth me.

I pray you all that aged be,
      How well did ye your youth carry?
I think some worse, of each degree:
      Therein a wager lay dare I,
      Though some saith that youth ruleth me.

Pastimes of youth sometime among,
      None can say but necessary.
I hurt no man, I do no wrong,
      I love true where I did marry,
      Though some saith that youth ruleth me.

Then soon discuss that hence we must.
      Pray we to God and Saint Mary
That all amend, and here an end,
      Thus saith the king, the eighth Harry,
      Though some saith that youth ruleth me.

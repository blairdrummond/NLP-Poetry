If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd, 
   And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet 
Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness; 
Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd, 
   Sandals more interwoven and complete 
To fit the naked foot of poesy; 
Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress 
Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd 
   By ear industrious, and attention meet: 
Misers of sound and syllable, no less 
   Than Midas of his coinage, let us be 
   Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown; 
So, if we may not let the Muse be free, 
   She will be bound with garlands of her own.

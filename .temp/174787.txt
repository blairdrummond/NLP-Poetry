 
Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy! 
For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood 
Upon our side, we who were strong in love! 
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, 
But to be young was very heaven!--Oh! times, 
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways 
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once 
The attraction of a country in romance! 
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights, 
When most intent on making of herself 
A prime Enchantress--to assist the work 
Which then was going forward in her name! 
Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth, 
The beauty wore of promise, that which sets 
(As at some moment might not be unfelt 
Among the bowers of paradise itself ) 
The budding rose above the rose full blown. 
What temper at the prospect did not wake 
To happiness unthought of? The inert 
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away! 
They who had fed their childhood upon dreams, 
The playfellows of fancy, who had made 
All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength 
Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred 
Among the grandest objects of the sense, 
And dealt with whatsoever they found there 
As if they had within some lurking right 
To wield it;--they, too, who, of gentle mood, 
Had watched all gentle motions, and to these 
Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild, 
And in the region of their peaceful selves;-- 
Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty 
Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire, 
And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish; 
Were called upon to exercise their skill, 
Not in Utopia, subterranean fields, 
Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where! 
But in the very world, which is the world 
Of all of us,--the place where in the end 
We find our happiness, or not at all!

Lucks, my fair falcon, and your fellows all,
   How well pleasant it were your liberty!
Ye not forsake me that fair might ye befall. 
But they that sometime liked my company: 
Like lice away from dead bodies they crawl. 
Lo what a proof in light adversity! 
But ye my birds, I swear by all your bells, 
Ye be my friends, and so be but few else.

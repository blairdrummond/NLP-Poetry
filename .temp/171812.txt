 
The sun frets, a fat wafer falling like a trap of failed mesh.
I watch the pin-glare of a mockingbird's eye cut sharply, descend 
on the blank water, then emerge from himself naked
as a girl who shimmered here, once, for me.

If we come back like penitents to kneel over water, bass swirling, 
scattering the mayflies that often, in silence, graze

lips, what is the word floating out from the mouth unbearable 
as a bird's black grin or a madman's lust?

The word is not we, but me. Giving it again and again

brings no one out of the willows and I, willing to believe 
like a sap in whatever dives or rises hear no voice 
but the mist sizzling on stones. I lift my head

for echoes out of trees, for the flashed recoil of flesh hung 
cheap and gaudy, wingless, above the stab of water 
that crunched her like a beer can. Toads honk

the only answer. Among them, a boy, I felt

the grotesque pull of the moon all night, peeled and went slowly 
down in terror, rising, falling through the pulpy leaves 
until the sun caught me, drained, and I was no one
wanted, so walked away from all knowing,

walked into town and drank, calmly, an illegal beer, then slept.

The hooks, in hairy hands, clawed it smooth as a dish, a super-
human search by flood and fire light. What could they find? 
Like many, I have been out of town a long time.

I wish the face floating above the chill at my knees opened 
the door of a drab hotel. I wish it said Go to hell 
or Do you know what time it is, anything

that, if I heard it, I could kneel to and swear to be faithful.

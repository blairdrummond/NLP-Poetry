 
A boy who knew enough to save for something   
like the whim that took me downtown on the bus   
one lost Saturday morning of my mother's birthday,   
I sat in the back where the gasoline smell   
made me dizzy and I closed my eyes but didn't   
think of her, only of myself, basking in the light   
and love that would fall down on me when I   
handed her the box and she untied the bow to save 
and lifted something shining out and held it up before us   
like a promise taking shape for once in her hands,   
though I didn't know what to buy, the bus door   
hissing behind me because I'm in some kind of   
state now, a trance that comes when you pull   
at the cords of light that connect the mother to the boy,   
the 1959 department store 
opening up before me like a jeweled city.   
In lingerie I found myself 
surrounded by those torsos sheened in silk,   
dreaming my mother, feeling the silk against me,   
the two of us moving through a cloudy room   
in a dance I can't remember until shame comes.   
From out of nowhere the matron frowned,   
asked what I wanted, hovered over me. 
Confused and afraid I whispered, without thinking, 
The black hose with rhinestones down the seams please 
and pointed to the pair across the room   
stretched over legs on the glass counter   
as if about to step off 
and I saw her in my mind slip them on,   
her skirt hiked above the garters, the sun   
catching in her tangled hair 
until the matron made a sound in her throat   
and looked at me with eyes that said   
What's wrong with you dirty boy. 

All the way home a sweet ache rocked me,   
the silver package riding my lap 
like a heavy wrong thing 
I couldn't give up no matter how it 
dragged me down to a place 
where I could barely breathe or see or feel.   
Whatever happened that spinning afternoon-- 
she ran her fingers over the rhinestone seams 
or she didn't, she wore them out into an evening 
or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible things-- 
doesn't matter. I would find my way into the light 
of another woman into whose arms I fall 
nights my fingers can't tear through the dark   
that eats me, the silk stretched across her breasts,   
the need for something womanly to raise me up   
pounding in my head until I curl in sleep   
away from those longings, ancient and blue.

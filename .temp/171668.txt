 
Night's afterbirth, last dream before waking,   
Holding on with dissolving hands, 
Out of it came, not a line of old men, 
But pairs of headlights, delaying morning. 

It felt like tears, like wetted bedsheets,   
And suspended in it like a medicine 
In vapor was the ocean's presence, ghost   
Of deep water and the bite of salt. 

Here you found your body again, 
The hand before your face and the face it touched,   
Eyes floating, feet on invisible ground, 
Vagueness like another skin. 

Sent out into it anyway, because it was morning,   
To taste it, touch blind hardness 
Like marble ruins, and skirt the edges, 
Razors in goosedown, hydrants' fists.

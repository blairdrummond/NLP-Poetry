 
Art begins with a lie 
      The separation is you plus me plus what we make   
            Look into lightbulb, blink, sun's in your eye 

I want a rare sky 
      vantage point free from misconception   
            Art begins with a lie 

Nothing to lose, spontaneous rise   
      of reflection, paint the picture 
            of a lightbulb, or eye the sun 

How to fuel the world, then die   
      Distance yourself from artfulness   
            How? Art begins with a lie 

The audience wants to cry 
      when the actors are real & passionate 
            Look into footlight, then feed back to eye 

You fluctuate in an artful body 
      You try to imitate the world's glory 
            Art begins with a lie 
                  That's the story, sharp speck in the eye.

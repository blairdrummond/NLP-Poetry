 
In the clear light that confuses everything   
Only you, dark laurel,   
Shadow my house, 

Lifting your arms in the anguish   
Of nature at the stake. 
And at night, quivering with tears, 

You are like the tree called Tasso's.   
Crippled, and hooped with iron,   
It stands on Peter's hill. 

When the lovers prop their bicycles   
And sit on the high benches   
That look across to eternity, 

That tree makes their own torsion 
Seem natural. And so, they're comforted.

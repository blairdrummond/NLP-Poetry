 
The first warm day,   
and by mid-afternoon   
the snow is no more   
than a washing 
strewn over the yards, 
the bedding rolled in knots   
and leaking water,   
the white shirts lying   
under the evergreens.   
Through the heaviest drifts   
rise autumn's fallen   
bicycles, small carnivals   
of paint and chrome,   
the Octopus 
and Tilt-A-Whirl   
beginning to turn 
in the sun. Now children,   
stiffened by winter   
and dressed, somehow,   
like old men, mutter   
and bend to the work   
of building dams. 
But such a spring is brief;   
by five o'clock 
the chill of sundown,   
darkness, the blue TVs   
flashing like storms 
in the picture windows,   
the yards gone gray,   
the wet dogs barking   
at nothing. Far off   
across the cornfields 
staked for streets and sewers,   
the body of a farmer   
missing since fall 
will show up 
in his garden tomorrow,   
as unexpected 
as a tulip.

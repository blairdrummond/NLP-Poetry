 
I close my eyes like a good little boy at night in bed,   
as I was told to do by my mother when she lived, 
and before bed I brush my teeth and slip on my pajamas,   
as I was told, and look forward to tomorrow. 

I do all things required of me to make me a citizen of sterling worth.   
I keep a job and come home each evening for dinner. I arrive at the   
same time on the same train to give my family a sense of order. 

I obey traffic signals. I am cordial to strangers, I answer my   
mail promptly. I keep a balanced checking account. Why can't I   
live forever?

 
The jellyfish 
float in the bay shallows 
like schools of clouds, 

a dozen identical -- is it right 
to call them creatures, 
these elaborate sacks 

of nothing? All they seem 
is shape, and shifting, 
and though a whole troop 

of undulant cousins 
go about their business 
within a single wave's span, 

every one does something unlike: 
this one a balloon 
open on both ends 

but swollen to its full expanse, 
this one a breathing heart, 
this a pulsing flower. 

This one a rolled condom, 
or a plastic purse swallowing itself, 
that one a Tiffany shade, 

this a troubled parasol. 
This submarine opera's 
all subterfuge and disguise, 

its plot a fabulous tangle 
of hiding and recognition: 
nothing but trope, 

nothing but something 
forming itself into figures 
then refiguring, 

sheer ectoplasm 
recognizable only as the stuff 
of metaphor. What can words do 

but link what we know 
to what we don't, 
and so form a shape? 

Which shrinks or swells, 
configures or collapses, blooms 
even as it is described 

into some unlikely 
marine chiffon: 
a gown for Isadora? 

Nothing but style. 
What binds 
one shape to another 

also sets them apart 
-- but what's lovelier 
than the shapeshifting 

transparence of like and as: 
clear, undulant words? 
We look at alien grace, 

unfettered 
by any determined form, 
and we say: balloon, flower, 

heart, condom, opera, 
lampshade, parasol, ballet. 
Hear how the mouth, 

so full 
of longing for the world, 
changes its shape?

 
It is true, that even in the best-run state   
Such things will happen; it is true, 
What's done is done. The law, whereby we hate   
Our hatred, sees no fire in the flue 
But by the smoke, and not for thought alone   
It punishes, but for the thing that's done. 

And yet there is the horror of the fact,   
Though we knew not the man. To die in jail,   
To be beaten to death, to know the act   
Of personal fury before the eyes can fail   
And the man die against the cold last wall   
Of the lonely world--and neither is that all: 

There is the terror too of each man's thought,   
That knows not, but must quietly suspect   
His neighbor, friend, or self of being taught   
To take an attitude merely correct;   
Being frightened of his own cold image in   
The glass of government, and his own sin, 

Frightened lest senate house and prison wall 
Be quarried of one stone, lest righteous and high   
Look faintly smiling down and seem to call   
A crime the welcome chance of liberty,   
And any man an outlaw who aggrieves   
The patriotism of a pair of thieves.

 
The names of things--sparks! 
I ran on them like a component:   
Henries, microhenries, Blue   
Beavers, wee wee ductors:   
Biographer of small lives, 
Of a plug and his girl named Jack,   
Of Utopian colonies which worked-- 
Steel, germanium, brass, aluminum, 
Replaceables. 
                   Outside, afloat, my words 
Swung an arm charting the woman 
Who was the river bottom. 

We tried, beyond work, at work,   
To keep what we loved. Near 
Christmas I remember the office 
Women trimming their desperately   
Glittering holy day trees. And, 
Just as I left, the company 
Talent show, the oils and sentiment   
Thick on still lifes and seacoasts, 
The brush strokes tortured as a child's   
First script. Someone 
Had studied driftwood; another man,   
The spray of a wave, the mania 
Of waters above torpedoes.

 
I wake and feel the city trembling. 
Yes, there is something unsettled in the air   
And the earth is uncertain. 

And so it was for the tenor Caruso. 
He couldn't sleep--you know how the ovation   
Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part. 

And then the ceiling trembled 
And the floor moved. He ran into the street.   
Never had Naples given him such a reception! 

The air was darker than Vesuvius.   
"O mamma mia," 
He cried, "I've lost my voice!" 

At that moment the hideous voice of Culture,   
Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs,   
Shrieked from the ruins. 

At that moment everyone became a performer.   
Otello and Don Giovanni   
And Figaro strode on the midmost stage. 

In the high window of a burning castle   
Lucia raved. Black horses 
Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells. 

The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords   
Were melting; masks and ruffs 
Burned--and the costumes of the peasants' chorus. 

Night fell. The white moon rose   
And sank in the Pacific. The tremors   
Passed under the waves. And Death rested.

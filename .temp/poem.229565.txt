For this she starred her eyes with salt 
And scooped her temples thin, 
Until her face shone pure of fault 
From the forehead to the chin. 

In coldest crucibles of pain 
Her shrinking flesh was fired 
And smoothed into a finer grain 
To make it more desired. 

Pain left her lips more clear than glass; 
It colored and cooled her hand. 
She lay a field of scented grass 
Yielded as pasture land. 

For this her loveliness was curved 
And carved as silver is: 
For this she was brave: but she deserved 
A better grave than this.

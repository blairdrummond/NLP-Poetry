 
The gravel road rides with a slow gallop   
over the fields, the telephone lines   
streaming behind, its billow of dust   
full of the sparks of redwing blackbirds. 

On either side, those dear old ladies, 
the loosening barns, their little windows   
dulled by cataracts of hay and cobwebs   
hide broken tractors under their skirts. 

So this is Nebraska. A Sunday   
afternoon; July. Driving along 
with your hand out squeezing the air,   
a meadowlark waiting on every post. 

Behind a shelterbelt of cedars, 
top-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and bees,   
a pickup kicks its fenders off 
and settles back to read the clouds. 

You feel like that; you feel like letting   
your tires go flat, like letting the mice   
build a nest in your muffler, like being   
no more than a truck in the weeds, 

clucking with chickens or sticky with honey   
or holding a skinny old man in your lap   
while he watches the road, waiting 
for someone to wave to. You feel like 

waving. You feel like stopping the car 
and dancing around on the road. You wave   
instead and leave your hand out gliding   
larklike over the wheat, over the houses.

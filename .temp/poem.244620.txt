I must have passed the crest a while ago
    And now I am going down.
Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know--
    But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown.

All the morning I thought how proud it would be
    To stand there straight as a queen--
Wrapped in the wind and the sun, with the world under me.
    But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.

It was nearly level along the beaten track
    And the brambles caught in my gown--
But it's no use now to think of turning back,
    The rest of the way will be only going down.

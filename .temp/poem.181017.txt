Adieu, farewell, earth's bliss; 
This world uncertain is; 
Fond are life's lustful joys; 
Death proves them all but toys; 
None from his darts can fly; 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Rich men, trust not in wealth, 
Gold cannot buy you health; 
Physic himself must fade. 
All things to end are made, 
The plague full swift goes by; 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Beauty is but a flower 
Which wrinkles will devour; 
Brightness falls from the air; 
Queens have died young and fair; 
Dust hath closed Helen's eye. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Strength stoops unto the grave, 
Worms feed on Hector's brave; 
Swords may not fight with fate, 
Earth still holds ope her gate. 
"Come, come!" the bells do cry. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us. 

Wit with his wantonness 
Tasteth death's bitterness; 
Hell's executioner 
Hath no ears for to hear 
What vain art can reply. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us. 

Haste, therefore, each degree, 
To welcome destiny; 
Heaven is our heritage, 
Earth but a player's stage; 
Mount we unto the sky. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us.

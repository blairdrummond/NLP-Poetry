 
I 
The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park 
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling 
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling 
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by 
   I have seen the general dare the combers come closer 
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm. 

II 
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.   
Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet. 
A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.

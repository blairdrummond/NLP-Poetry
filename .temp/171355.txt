 
When I was a young man, I loved to write poems   
         And I called a spade a spade 
And the only only thing that made me sing   
         Was to lift the masks at the masquerade.   
I took them off my own face, 
         I took them off others too 
And the only only wrong in all my song 
         Was the view that I knew what was true. 

Now I am older and tireder too 
         And the tasks with the masks are quite trying.   
I'd gladly gladly stop if I only only knew 
         A better way to keep from lying,   
And not get nervous and blue 
         When I said something quite untrue:   
I looked all around and all over 
         To find something else to do:   
I tried to be less romantic 
         I tried to be less starry-eyed too:   
But I only got mixed up and frantic 
         Forgetting what was false and what was true. 

But tonight I am going to the masked ball, 
         Because it has occurred to me 
That the masks are more true than the faces: 
         --Perhaps this too is poetry? 
I no longer yearn to be naive and stern 
         And masked balls fascinate me: 
Now that I know that most falsehoods are true 
         Perhaps I can join the charade?   
This is, at any rate, my new and true view: 
         Let live and believe, I say. 
The only only thing is to believe in everything: 
         It's more fun and safer that way!

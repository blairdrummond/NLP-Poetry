 
It will be an island on strings   
well out to sea and austere   
bobbing as if at anchor 
green with enormous fir trees   
formal as telephone poles. 

We will arrive there slowly 
hand over hand without oars.   
Last out, you will snip the fragile   
umbilicus white as a beansprout   
that sewed us into our diaries. 

We will be two bleached hermits   
at home in our patches and tears. 
We will butter the sun with our wisdom.   
Our days will be grapes on a trellis   
perfectly oval and furred. 

At night we will set our poems   
adrift in ginger ale bottles   
each with a clamshell rudder   
each with a piggyback spider   
waving them off by dogstar 

and nothing will come from the mainland   
to tell us who cares, who cares 
and nothing will come of our lovelock   
except as our two hearts go soft 
and black as avocado pears.

What, have I thus betrayed my liberty? 
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave 
In my free side? or am I born a slave, 
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny? 
Or want I sense to feel my misery? 
Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have? 
Who for long faith, though daily help I crave, 
May get no alms but scorn of beggary. 
Virtue, awake! Beauty but beauty is; 
I may, I must, I can, I will, I do 
Leave following that which it is gain to miss. 
Let her go. Soft, but here she comes. Go to, 
Unkind, I love you not! O me, that eye 
Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!

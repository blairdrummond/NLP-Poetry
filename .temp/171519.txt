 
As we drove back, crossing the hill, 
The house still 
Hidden in the trees, I always thought-- 
A fool's fear--that it might have caught   
Fire, someone could have broken in.   
As if things must have been 
Too good here. Still, we always found   
It locked tight, safe and sound. 

I mentioned that, once, as a joke;   
No doubt we spoke 
Of the absurdity 
To fear some dour god's jealousy   
Of our good fortune. From the farm   
Next door, our neighbors saw no harm   
Came to the things we cared for here.   
What did we have to fear? 

Maybe I should have thought: all 
Such things rot, fall-- 
Barns, houses, furniture. 
We two are stronger than we were 
Apart; we've grown 
Together. Everything we own 
Can burn; we know what counts--some such   
Idea. We said as much. 

We'd watched friends driven to betray;   
Felt that love drained away 
Some self they need. 
We'd said love, like a growth, can feed   
On hate we turn in and disguise; 
We warned ourselves. That you might despise   
Me--hate all we both loved best-- 
None of us ever guessed. 

The house still stands, locked, as it stood   
Untouched a good 
Two years after you went. 
Some things passed in the settlement;   
Some things slipped away. Enough's left   
That I come back sometimes. The theft   
And vandalism were our own. 
Maybe we should have known.

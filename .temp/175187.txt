 
Not in that wasted garden 
Where bodies are drawn into grass 
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens 
That bear no fruit -- 
There where along the shaded walks 
Vain sighs are heard, 
And vainer dreams are dreamed 
Of close communion with departed souls -- 
But here under the apple tree 
I loved and watched and pruned 
With gnarled hands 
In the long, long years; 
Here under the roots of this northern-spy 
To move in the chemic change and circle of life, 
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree, 
And into the living epitaphs 
Of redder apples!

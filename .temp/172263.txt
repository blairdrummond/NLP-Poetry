 
You have not conquered me?it is the surge
   Of love itself that beats against my will; 
It is the sting of conflict, the old urge
   That calls me still.

It is not you I love?it is the form
   And shadow of all lovers who have died 
That gives you all the freshness of a warm 
   And unfamiliar bride.

It is your name I breathe, your hands I seek; 
   It will be you when you are gone.
And yet the dream, the name I never speak, 
   Is that that lures me on.

It is the golden summons, the bright wave 
   Of banners calling me anew;
It is all beauty, perilous and grave?
   It is not you.

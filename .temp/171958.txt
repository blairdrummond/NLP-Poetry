 


The autumn shade is thin. Grey leaves lie faint 
Where they will lie, and, where the thick green was, 
Light stands up, like a presence, to the sky. 
The trees seem merely shadows of its age. 
From off the hill, I hear the logging crew, 
The furious and indifferent saw, the slow 
Response of heavy pine; and I recall 
That goddesses have died when their trees died. 
Often in summer, drinking from the spring, 
I sensed in its cool breath and in its voice 
A living form, darker than any shade 
And without feature, passionate, yet chill 
With lust to fix in ice the buoyant rim?
Ancient of days, the mother of us all. 
Now, toward his destined passion there, the strong, 
Vivid young man, reluctant, may return 
From suffering in his own experience 
To lie down in the darkness. In this time, 
I stay in doors. I do my work. I sleep. 
Each morning, when I wake, I assent to wake. 
The shadow of my fist moves on this page, 
Though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank, 
Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snake 
Does as it must, and sinks into the cold.

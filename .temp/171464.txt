 
Extravagant sweep 
                         of clear sky 
                                           darkening 
in the big picture window 
                                     beside the bed, 
lights here and there 
                               already flashing all 
across the city down below us-- 
                                              Ellen 
and the girls out somewhere, 
                                          you and I alone, 
you with your eyes closed, 
                                       I with a drink in hand: 
you suddenly in character, 
                                        your voice 
a wraith's voice, 
                         faint, stumbling, 
                                                   slurry 
with morphine, 
                     and yet 
                               still artful 
                                                 as ever, 
even if the art 
                      was obvious, 
the dying brother 
                      playing the dying brother-- 
Do you think 
                  you have a problem 
                                             with that? 
                                                            the question   
masking a declaration, 
                                 the brother 
                                                 a savior,   
the savior a judge, 
                            not all that different from   
before except that now 
                                 the dying had   
distilled 
             all doubt away 
                                  as you repeated,   
Do you think 
                  you have a 
                                 problem? 
                                                "Me? With what?"   
I too in character now, 
                                  the character   
without character, 
                           the little brother who   

in your mind proves 
                              the truth 
                                           of all you think   
by his resistance to it, 
                                    pulling 
                                                the scene off   
by refusing to play it, 
                                  pretending not to know: 
"With what?" 
                With that, 
                                  head tilted to the shot 
glass, 
         "This?" 
                   my one desire now 
                                             a little shtick, 
a final moment 
                     of material-- 
                                       "This? 
A problem? 
               Not at all. 
                               There's plenty more 
where that came from, 
                               almost a whole bottle." 
You imperturbable, 
                           Look at yourself, 
how you sit here 
                           drinking all alone. 
                                                       "Well, mea 
gulpa. 
         Are you happy now?" 
                                     You drink 
a lot. 
         "I have a lot 
                              to drink about." 
And that was that. 
                            For now you drifted off, 
or seemed to, 
                     your eyes closed, 
                                                head turned away,   
the two of us 
                     together 
                                  for the last 
time ever on the stage 
                                  of being brothers, 
our see-through 
                        figures in the picture window   
spectral and vast 
                           against the city 
                                                    flashing 
a ghostly circuitry 
                              of nerves 
                                             within 
the ancient masks we wore, 
                                        the hand I lifted, 
the drink I knocked back 
                                     in a final toast 
in honor of the timing, 
                                  the concentration 
that neither 
                   one of us 
                                  could ever break.

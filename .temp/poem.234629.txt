Having been tenant long to a rich lord, 
    Not thriving, I resolved to be bold, 
    And make a suit unto him, to afford 
A new small-rented lease, and cancel th' old. 

In heaven at his manor I him sought; 
    They told me there that he was lately gone 
    About some land, which he had dearly bought 
Long since on earth, to take possession. 

I straight returned, and knowing his great birth, 
    Sought him accordingly in great resorts; 
    In cities, theaters, gardens, parks, and courts; 
At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth 


    Of thieves and murderers; there I him espied, 
    Who straight, Your suit is granted, said, and died.

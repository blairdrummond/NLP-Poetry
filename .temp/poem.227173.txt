He dwelt among "apartments let," 
      About five stories high; 
A man I thought that none would get, 
      And very few would try. 

A boulder, by a larger stone 
      Half hidden in the mud, 
Fair as a man when only one 
      Is in the neighborhood. 

He lived unknown, and few could tell 
      When Jacob was not free; 
But he has got a wife,--and O! 
      The difference to me!

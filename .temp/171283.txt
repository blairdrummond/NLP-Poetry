 
Liebe, meine liebe, I had not hoped   
to be so poor 

                   The night winds reach   
like the blind breath of the world 
in a rhythm without mind, gusting and beating   
as if to destroy us, battering our poverty   
and all the land's flat and cold and dark 
under iron snow 

                        the dog leaps in the wind   
barking, maddened with winter, and his voice   
claps again and again down the valley   
like tatters of revolutionary pennants 
                                                         birches 
cry and hemlocks by the brook 
stand hunched and downcast with their hands   
in their pockets 

Liebe, the world is wild   
and without intention 

                               how far 
this might be from the night of Christmas   
if it were not for you. 

Down the reaching wind 
shrieks of starlight bear broken messages 
among mountains where shadows plunge 
                                                      yet our brightness   
is unwavering 
                   Kennst du das land   
wo die zitronen bluhn, im dunkeln laub 
die goldorangen ... liebe 
art thou singing 

It is a question partly 
of the tree with our stars and partly 
of your radiance brought from the land   
where legends flower to this land   
but more than these our bright poverty   
is a house in the wind and a light   
on the mountain 

Liebe, our light rekindled 
in this remoteness from the other land, 
in this dark of the blue mountain where only   
the winds gather 
      is what we are for the time that we are   
      what we know for the time that we know 

How gravely and sweetly the poor touch in the dark.

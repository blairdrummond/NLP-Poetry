Through the black, rushing smoke-bursts, 
Thick breaks the red flame; 
All Etna heaves fiercely 
Her forest-clothed frame. 

Not here, O Apollo! 
Are haunts meet for thee. 
But, where Helicon breaks down 
In cliff to the sea, 

Where the moon-silver'd inlets 
Send far their light voice 
Up the still vale of Thisbe, 
O speed, and rejoice! 

On the sward at the cliff-top 
Lie strewn the white flocks, 
On the cliff-side the pigeons 
Roost deep in the rocks. 

In the moonlight the shepherds, 
Soft lull'd by the rills, 
Lie wrapped in their blankets 
Asleep on the hills. 

--What forms are these coming 
So white through the gloom? 
What garments out-glistening 
The gold-flower'd broom? 

What sweet-breathing presence 
Out-perfumes the thyme? 
What voices enrapture 
The night's balmy prime? 

'Tis Apollo comes leading 
His choir, the Nine. 
--The leader is fairest, 
But all are divine. 

They are lost in the hollows! 
They stream up again! 
What seeks on this mountain 
The glorified train?-- 

They bathe on this mountain, 
In the spring by their road; 
Then on to Olympus, 
Their endless abode. 

--Whose proase do they mention? 
Of what is it told?-- 
What will be for ever; 
What was from of old. 

First hymn they the Father 
Of all things; and then, 
The rest of immortals, 
The action of men. 

The day in his hotness, 
The strife with the palm; 
The night in her silence, 
The stars in their calm.

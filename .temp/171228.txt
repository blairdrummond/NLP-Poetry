 
From the tawny light 
from the rainy nights 
from the imagination finding 
itself and more than itself 
alone and more than alone 
at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,   
can you pull me 

into December? a lowland 
of space, perception of space 
towering of shadows of clouds blown upon 
clouds over 
                  new ground, new made 
under heavy December footsteps? the only 
way to live? 

The flawed moon 
acts on the truth, and makes   
an autumn of tentative 
silences. 
You lived, but somewhere else, 
your presence touched others, ring upon ring, 
and changed. Did you think   
I would not change? 

                              The black moon 
turns away, its work done. A tenderness, 
unspoken autumn.   
We are faithful 
only to the imagination. What the 
imagination 
             seizes 
as beauty must be truth. What holds you 
to what you see of me is 
that grasp alone.

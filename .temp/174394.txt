 
Many a green isle needs must be 
In the deep wide sea of Misery, 
Or the mariner, worn and wan, 
Never thus could voyage on 
Day and night, and night and day, 
Drifting on his dreary way, 
With the solid darkness black 
Closing round his vessel's track; 
Whilst above, the sunless sky, 
Big with clouds, hangs heavily, 
And behind, the tempest fleet 
Hurries on with lightning feet, 
Riving sail, and cord, and plank, 
Till the ship has almost drank 
Death from the o'er-brimming deep; 
And sinks down, down, like that sleep 
When the dreamer seems to be 
Weltering through eternity; 
And the dim low line before 
Of a dark and distant shore 
Still recedes, as ever still 
Longing with divided will, 
But no power to seek or shun, 
He is ever drifted on 
O'er the unreposing wave 
To the haven of the grave. 
What, if there no friends will greet; 
What, if there no heart will meet 
His with love's impatient beat; 
Wander wheresoe'er he may, 
Can he dream before that day 
To find refuge from distress 
In friendship's smile, in love's caress? 
Then 'twill wreak him little woe 
Whether such there be or no: 
Senseless is the breast and cold 
Which relenting love would fold; 
Bloodless are the veins and chill 
Which the pulse of pain did fill; 
Every little living nerve 
That from bitter words did swerve 
Round the tortur'd lips and brow, 
Are like sapless leaflets now 
Frozen upon December's bough. 

On the beach of a northern sea 
Which tempests shake eternally, 
As once the wretch there lay to sleep, 
Lies a solitary heap, 
One white skull and seven dry bones, 
On the margin of the stones, 
Where a few gray rushes stand, 
Boundaries of the sea and land: 
Nor is heard one voice of wail 
But the sea-mews, as they sail 
O'er the billows of the gale; 
Or the whirlwind up and down 
Howling, like a slaughter'd town, 
When a king in glory rides 
Through the pomp of fratricides: 
Those unburied bones around 
There is many a mournful sound; 
There is no lament for him, 
Like a sunless vapour, dim, 
Who once cloth'd with life and thought 
What now moves nor murmurs not. 

Ay, many flowering islands lie 
In the waters of wide Agony: 
To such a one this morn was led 
My bark, by soft winds piloted: 
'Mid the mountains Euganean 
I stood listening to the paean 
With which the legion'd rooks did hail 
The sun's uprise majestical; 
Gathering round with wings all hoar, 
Through the dewy mist they soar 
Like gray shades, till the eastern heaven 
Bursts, and then, as clouds of even, 
Fleck'd with fire and azure, lie 
In the unfathomable sky, 
So their plumes of purple grain, 
Starr'd with drops of golden rain, 
Gleam above the sunlight woods, 
As in silent multitudes 
On the morning's fitful gale 
Through the broken mist they sail, 
And the vapours cloven and gleaming 
Follow, down the dark steep streaming, 
Till all is bright, and clear, and still, 
Round the solitary hill. 

Beneath is spread like a green sea 
The waveless plain of Lombardy, 
Bounded by the vaporous air, 
Islanded by cities fair; 
Underneath Day's azure eyes 
Ocean's nursling, Venice lies, 
A peopled labyrinth of walls, 
Amphitrite's destin'd halls, 
Which her hoary sire now paves 
With his blue and beaming waves. 
Lo! the sun upsprings behind, 
Broad, red, radiant, half-reclin'd 
On the level quivering line 
Of the water crystalline; 
And before that chasm of light, 
As within a furnace bright, 
Column, tower, and dome, and spire, 
Shine like obelisks of fire, 
Pointing with inconstant motion 
From the altar of dark ocean 
To the sapphire-tinted skies; 
As the flames of sacrifice 
From the marble shrines did rise, 
As to pierce the dome of gold 
Where Apollo spoke of old. 

Sun-girt City, thou hast been 
Ocean's child, and then his queen; 
Now is come a darker day, 
And thou soon must be his prey, 
If the power that rais'd thee here 
Hallow so thy watery bier. 
A less drear ruin then than now, 
With thy conquest-branded brow 
Stooping to the slave of slaves 
From thy throne, among the waves 
Wilt thou be, when the sea-mew 
Flies, as once before it flew, 
O'er thine isles depopulate, 
And all is in its ancient state, 
Save where many a palace gate 
With green sea-flowers overgrown 
Like a rock of Ocean's own, 
Topples o'er the abandon'd sea 
As the tides change sullenly. 
The fisher on his watery way, 
Wandering at the close of day, 
Will spread his sail and seize his oar 
Till he pass the gloomy shore, 
Lest thy dead should, from their sleep 
Bursting o'er the starlight deep, 
Lead a rapid masque of death 
O'er the waters of his path. 
Those who alone thy towers behold 
Quivering through a{:e}real gold, 
As I now behold them here, 
Would imagine not they were 
Sepulchres, where human forms, 
Like pollution-nourish'd worms, 
To the corpse of greatness cling, 
Murder'd, and now mouldering: 
But if Freedom should awake 
In her omnipotence, and shake 
From the Celtic Anarch's hold 
All the keys of dungeons cold, 
Where a hundred cities lie 
Chain'd like thee, ingloriously, 
Thou and all thy sister band 
Might adorn this sunny land, 
Twining memories of old time 
With new virtues more sublime; 
If not, perish thou and they, 
Clouds which stain truth's rising day 
By her sun consum'd away-- 
Earth can spare ye! while like flowers, 
In the waste of years and hours, 
From your dust new nations spring 
With more kindly blossoming. 

Perish--let there only be 
Floating o'er thy hearthless sea 
As the garment of thy sky 
Clothes the world immortally, 
One remembrance, more sublime 
Than the tatter'd pall of time, 
Which scarce hides thy visage wan: 
That a tempest-cleaving Swan 
Of the sons of Albion, 
Driven from his ancestral streams 
By the might of evil dreams, 
Found a nest in thee; and Ocean 
Welcom'd him with such emotion 
That its joy grew his, and sprung 
From his lips like music flung 
O'er a mighty thunder-fit, 
Chastening terror: what though yet 
Poesy's unfailing river, 
Which through Albion winds forever 
Lashing with melodious wave 
Many a sacred Poet's grave, 
Mourn its latest nursling fled! 
What though thou with all thy dead 
Scarce can for this fame repay 
Aught thine own, oh, rather say 
Though thy sins and slaveries foul 
Overcloud a sunlike soul! 
As the ghost of Homer clings 
Round Scamander's wasting springs; 
As divinest Shakespeare's might 
Fills Avon and the world with light 
Like omniscient power which he 
Imag'd 'mid mortality; 
As the love from Petrarch's urn 
Yet amid yon hills doth burn, 
A quenchless lamp by which the heart 
Sees things unearthly; so thou art, 
Mighty spirit: so shall be 
The City that did refuge thee. 

Lo, the sun floats up the sky 
Like thought-winged Liberty, 
Till the universal light 
Seems to level plain and height; 
From the sea a mist has spread, 
And the beams of morn lie dead 
On the towers of Venice now, 
Like its glory long ago. 
By the skirts of that gray cloud 
Many-domed Padua proud 
Stands, a peopled solitude, 
'Mid the harvest-shining plain, 
Where the peasant heaps his grain 
In the garner of his foe, 
And the milk-white oxen slow 
With the purple vintage strain, 
Heap'd upon the creaking wain, 
That the brutal Celt may swill 
Drunken sleep with savage will; 
And the sickle to the sword 
Lies unchang'd though many a lord, 
Like a weed whose shade is poison, 
Overgrows this region's foison, 
Sheaves of whom are ripe to come 
To destruction's harvest-home: 
Men must reap the things they sow, 
Force from force must ever flow, 
Or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe 
That love or reason cannot change 
The despot's rage, the slave's revenge. 

Padua, thou within whose walls 
Those mute guests at festivals, 
Son and Mother, Death and Sin, 
Play'd at dice for Ezzelin, 
Till Death cried, 'I win, I win!' 
And Sin curs'd to lose the wager, 
But Death promis'd, to assuage her, 
That he would petition for 
Her to be made Vice-Emperor, 
When the destin'd years were o'er, 
Over all between the Po 
And the eastern Alpine snow, 
Under the mighty Austrian. 
Sin smil'd so as Sin only can, 
And since that time, ay, long before, 
Both have rul'd from shore to shore, 
That incestuous pair, who follow 
Tyrants as the sun the swallow, 
As Repentance follows Crime, 
And as changes follow Time. 

In thine halls the lamp of learning, 
Padua, now no more is burning; 
Like a meteor, whose wild way 
Is lost over the grave of day, 
It gleams betray'd and to betray: 
Once remotest nations came 
To adore that sacred flame, 
When it lit not many a hearth 
On this cold and gloomy earth: 
Now new fires from antique light 
Spring beneath the wide world's might; 
But their spark lies dead in thee, 
Trampled out by Tyranny. 
As the Norway woodman quells, 
In the depth of piny dells, 
One light flame among the brakes, 
While the boundless forest shakes, 
And its mighty trunks are torn 
By the fire thus lowly born: 
The spark beneath his feet is dead, 
He starts to see the flames it fed 
Howling through the darken'd sky 
With myriad tongues victoriously, 
And sinks down in fear: so thou, 
O Tyranny, beholdest now 
Light around thee, and thou hearest 
The loud flames ascend, and fearest: 
Grovel on the earth; ay, hide 
In the dust thy purple pride! 

Noon descends around me now: 
'Tis the noon of autumn's glow, 
When a soft and purple mist 
Like a vaporous amethyst, 
Or an air-dissolved star 
Mingling light and fragrance, far 
From the curv'd horizon's bound 
To the point of Heaven's profound, 
Fills the overflowing sky; 
And the plains that silent lie 
Underneath, the leaves unsodden 
Where the infant Frost has trodden 
With his morning-winged feet, 
Whose bright print is gleaming yet; 
And the red and golden vines, 
Piercing with their trellis'd lines 
The rough, dark-skirted wilderness; 
The dun and bladed grass no less, 
Pointing from his hoary tower 
In the windless air; the flower 
Glimmering at my feet; the line 
Of the olive-sandall'd Apennine 
In the south dimly islanded; 
And the Alps, whose snows are spread 
High between the clouds and sun; 
And of living things each one; 
And my spirit which so long 
Darken'd this swift stream of song, 
Interpenetrated lie 
By the glory of the sky: 
Be it love, light, harmony, 
Odour, or the soul of all 
Which from Heaven like dew doth fall, 
Or the mind which feeds this verse 
Peopling the lone universe. 

Noon descends, and after noon 
Autumn's evening meets me soon, 
Leading the infantine moon, 
And that one star, which to her 
Almost seems to minister 
Half the crimson light she brings 
From the sunset's radiant springs: 
And the soft dreams of the morn 
(Which like winged winds had borne 
To that silent isle, which lies 
Mid remember'd agonies, 
The frail bark of this lone being) 
Pass, to other sufferers fleeing, 
And its ancient pilot, Pain, 
Sits beside the helm again. 

Other flowering isles must be 
In the sea of Life and Agony: 
Other spirits float and flee 
O'er that gulf: even now, perhaps, 
On some rock the wild wave wraps, 
With folded wings they waiting sit 
For my bark, to pilot it 
To some calm and blooming cove, 
Where for me, and those I love, 
May a windless bower be built, 
Far from passion, pain and guilt, 
In a dell mid lawny hills, 
Which the wild sea-murmur fills, 
And soft sunshine, and the sound 
Of old forests echoing round, 
And the light and smell divine 
Of all flowers that breathe and shine: 
We may live so happy there, 
That the Spirits of the Air, 
Envying us, may even entice 
To our healing paradise 
The polluting multitude; 
But their rage would be subdu'd 
By that clime divine and calm, 
And the winds whose wings rain balm 
On the uplifted soul, and leaves 
Under which the bright sea heaves; 
While each breathless interval 
In their whisperings musical 
The inspired soul supplies 
With its own deep melodies, 
And the love which heals all strife 
Circling, like the breath of life, 
All things in that sweet abode 
With its own mild brotherhood: 
They, not it, would change; and soon 
Every sprite beneath the moon 
Would repent its envy vain, 
And the earth grow young again.

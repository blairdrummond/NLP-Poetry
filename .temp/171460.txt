 
Guadalajara--New York, 1965 
The trees are crystal chandeliers,   
and deep in the hollow 
a child pits its voice 
against the rain. 
The city screams its prayers   
at the towers in the distance. 

Those guitars again. 
And the Catholic mantis   
clutching at the sky, 
a pearl of a city, 
cuando se duerme. 

Subway blue boys 
now ride shotgun 
against my freedom and my fears.   
Pistols snap like indignant heels, 
at midday, and we stand at the docks,   
singing a farewell we'd soon forget. 

Hymns resound against that dome   
entre la fiesta y la agonia. 
Worms feed on its concrete, 
or we pluck them out of bodies. 

But time to forget. 
Or remember the easiness   
of leaving easy loves, 
disappearing 
in the arms of secret dreams. 

We'll sit at the end   
of a banquet board, 
and powder our tutored wigs, 
flip the pages of gentility 
in the rainy season. 

English lessons over tea   
for the price of memory. 

         Il mio supplizio   
         e quando 
         non mi credo   
         in armonia. 

They say the time 
is not much different. 
The strange and customary turns   
of living may coincide. 

In Mariachi Plaza 
travelers sing elegies to the beauty   
of revolutions and tranquillity. 

From the opposite side of the river,   
coming in, the skyline seems scrubbed   
and pointed ominously into the darkness. 

I walk through the market,   
kissing colors in a murmur   
of self-induced petition. 

Two spires, 
lying against the night, 
are suddenly armed to sail. 

The water foams against the bottom,   
the way it looked when I left 
that dying city 

Only a turning to feel the bark 
slope off into the night, 
with a promise to return. 

         Un di, s'io non andro sempre fuggendo   
         di gente in gente, mi vedrai seduto 
         su la tua pietra, o fratel mio, gemendo   
         it fior dei tuoi gentili anni caduto. 

From line to line,   
from point to point, 
is an architect's end of cities. 

But I lie down 
to a different turbulence 
and a plan of transformation.

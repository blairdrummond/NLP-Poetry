The splendour falls on castle walls 
                And snowy summits old in story: 
         The long light shakes across the lakes, 
                And the wild cataract leaps in glory. 
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, 
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying. 

         O hark, O hear! how thin and clear, 
                And thinner, clearer, farther going! 
         O sweet and far from cliff and scar 
                The horns of Elfland faintly blowing! 
Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying: 
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying. 

         O love, they die in yon rich sky, 
                They faint on hill or field or river: 
         Our echoes roll from soul to soul, 
                And grow for ever and for ever. 
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, 
And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

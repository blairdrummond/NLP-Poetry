(January 7, 1915)
In the dregs of the year, all steam and rain, 
In the timid time of the heart again, 
When indecision is bold and thorough, 
And action dreams of a dawn in vain, 

I saw high up over Bloxham vale 
The ploughshare tilt to the next long trail, 
And, spying a larder in every furrow, 
The wagtails crowd like a dancing hail! 

A second wonder there on the hill: 
Beneath the hedge, I saw with a thrill 
The budding primroses laugh good-morrow 
From a deep cradle rocked by a rill! 

Wagtail smart in his belted blue, 
Primrose paying her gold ere due,-- 
(Out upon Winter! Down with Sorrow!) 
These are the things that I know are true.

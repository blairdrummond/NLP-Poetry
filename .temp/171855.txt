 
(In Plaster, with a Bronze Wash)
A person is very self-conscious about his head. 
It makes one nervous just to know it is cast 
In enduring materials, and that when the real one is dead   
The cast one, if nobody drops it or melts it down, will last. 

We pay more attention to the front end, where the face is,   
Than to the interesting and involute interior: 
The Fissure of Rolando and such queer places 
Are parks for the passions and fears and mild hysteria. 

The things that go on there! Erotic movies are shown   
To anyone not accompanied by an adult. 
The marquee out front maintains a superior tone:   
Documentaries on Sharks and The Japanese Tea Cult. 

The fronts of some heads are extravagantly pretty.   
These are the females. Men sometimes blow their tops   
About them, launch triremes, sack a whole city.   
The female head is mounted on rococo props. 

Judgment is in the head somewhere; it keeps sums   
Of pleasure and pain and gives belated warning;   
This is the first place everybody comes 
With bills, complaints, writs, summons, in the morning. 

This particular head, to my certain knowledge 
Has been taught to read and write, make love and money,   
Operate cars and airplanes, teach in a college,   
And tell involved jokes, some few extremely funny. 

It was further taught to know and to eschew   
Error and sin, which it does erratically. 
This is the place the soul calls home just now.   
One dislikes it of course: it is the seat of Me.

Why will Delia thus retire, 
   And idly languish life away? 
While the sighing crowd admire, 
   'Tis too soon for hartshorn tea: 



All those dismal looks and fretting 
   Cannot Damon's life restore; 
Long ago the worms have eat him, 
   You can never see him more. 



Once again consult your toilette, 
   In the glass your face review: 
So much weeping soon will spoil it, 
   And no spring your charms renew. 



I, like you, was born a woman, 
   Well I know what vapors mean: 
The disease, alas! is common; 
   Single, we have all the spleen. 



All the morals that they tell us, 
   Never cured the sorrow yet: 
Chuse, among the pretty fellows, 
   One of honor, youth, and wit. 



Prithee hear him every morning 
   At least an hour or two; 
Once again at night returning-- 
   I believe the dose will do.

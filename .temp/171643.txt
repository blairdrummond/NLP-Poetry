 
We have a secret, just we three, 
The robin, and I, and the sweet cherry-tree; 
The bird told the tree, and the tree told me, 
And nobody knows it but just us three. 

But of course the robin knows it best, 
Because she built the--I shan't tell the rest; 
And laid the four little--something in it--
I'm afraid I shall tell it every minute. 

But if the tree and the robin don't peep, 
I'll try my best the secret to keep; 
Though I know when the little birds fly about 
Then the whole secret will be out.

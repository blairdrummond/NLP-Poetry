 
The red eyes of rabbits   
aren't sad. No one passes 
the sad golden village in a barge 
any more. The sunset   
will leave it alone. If the   
curtains hang askew   
it is no one's fault. 
Around and around and around 
everywhere the same sound   
of wheels going, and things   
growing older, growing   
silent. If the dogs 
bark to each other 
all night, and their eyes   
flash red, that's 
nobody's business. They have   
a great space of dark to   
bark across. The rabbits   
will bare their teeth at   
the spring moon.

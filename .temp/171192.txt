 
Glory be to God for sexy things--   
   For cries of coupled lovers as they bind and bow; 
       For moles that on her hip'll make his dolphin swim, 
Fresh and fired up; nutty balls; G-strings; 
   Lovescapes pulsing and flesh-shoaled--furrow and plow; 
      And all shapes, their leer and freckle and whim. 

All people dumpy, bald, regressive, strange; 
   Whoever is fickle, faithful (who knows how?) 
   With slick, abrasive; sweet, sour; disheveled, trim; 
Who father-forth and mother-forth all change--   
                     Praise Him.

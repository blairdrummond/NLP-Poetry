I swive as well as others do, 
I'm young, not yet deformed, 
My tender heart, sincere, and true, 
Deserves not to be scorned. 

Why Phyllis then, why will you swive, 
With forty lovers more? 
Can I (said she) with Nature strive, 
Alas I am, alas I am a whore. 

Were all my body larded o'er, 
With darts of love, so thick, 
That you might find in ev'ry pore, 
A well stuck standing prick; 

Whilst yet my eyes alone were free, 
My heart, would never doubt, 
In am'rous rage, and ecstasy, 
To wish those eyes, to wish those eyes fucked out.

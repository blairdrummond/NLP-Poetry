They shut me up in Prose - 
As when a little Girl 
They put me in the Closet - 
Because they liked me "still"   - 

Still! Could themself have peeped - 
And seen my Brain - go round - 
They might as wise have lodged a Bird 
For Treason - in the Pound - 

Himself has but to will 
And easy as a Star 
Look down opon Captivity - 
And laugh - No more have I -

I ask not wit, nor beauty do I crave, 
Nor wealth, nor pompous titles wish to have; 
But since, 'tis doomed through all degrees of life, 
Whether a daughter, sister, or a wife; 
That females should the stronger males obey, 
And yield implicit to their lordly sway; 
Since this, I say, is ev'ry woman's fate, 
Give me a mind to suit my slavish state.

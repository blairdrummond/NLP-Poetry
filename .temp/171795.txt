 
I. 

Five soldiers fixed by Mathew Brady's eye   
Stand in a land subdued beyond belief.   
Belief might lend them life again. I try 
Like orphaned Hamlet working up his grief 

To see my spellbound fathers in these men   
Who, breathless in their amber atmosphere,   
Show but the postures men affected then   
And the hermit faces of a finished year. 

The guns and gear and all are strange until   
Beyond the tents I glimpse a file of trees   
Verging a road that struggles up a hill.   
They're sycamores. 
                            The long-abated breeze 

Flares in those boughs I know, and hauls the sound   
Of guns and a great forest in distress. 
Fathers, I know my cause, and we are bound   
Beyond that hill to fight at Wilderness. 


             II. 

But trick your eyes with Birnam Wood, or think   
How fire-cast shadows of the bankside trees   
Rode on the back of Simois to sink 
In the wide waters. Reflect how history's 

Changes are like the sea's, which mauls and mulls   
Its salvage of the world in shifty waves, 
Shrouding in evergreen the oldest hulls 
And yielding views of its confounded graves 

To the new moon, the sun, or any eye   
That in its shallow shoreward version sees 
The pebbles charging with a deathless cry   
And carageen memorials of trees.

 

Like a lone Arab, old and blind,
Some caravan had left behind,
Who sits beside a ruin'd well,
Where the shy sand-asps bask and swell;
And now he hangs his ag{'e}d head aslant,
And listens for a human sound?in vain!
And now the aid, which Heaven alone can grant,
Upturns his eyeless face from Heaven to gain;?
Even thus, in vacant mood, one sultry hour,
Resting my eye upon a drooping plant,
With brow low-bent, within my garden-bower,
I sate upon the couch of camomile;
And?whether 'twas a transient sleep, perchance,
Flitted across the idle brain, the while
I watch'd the sickly calm with aimless scope,
In my own heart; or that, indeed a trance,
Turn'd my eye inward?thee, O genial Hope,
Love's elder sister! thee did I behold
Drest as a bridesmaid, but all pale and cold,
With roseless cheek, all pale and cold and dim,
      Lie lifeless at my feet!
And then came Love, a sylph in bridal trim,
      And stood beside my seat;
She bent, and kiss'd her sister's lips,
      As she was wont to do;?
Alas! 'twas but a chilling breath
Woke just enough of life in death
      To make Hope die anew.

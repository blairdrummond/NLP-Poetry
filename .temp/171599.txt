 
I am leading a quiet life   
in Mike's Place every day   
watching the champs 
of the Dante Billiard Parlor   
and the French pinball addicts.   
I am leading a quiet life   
on lower East Broadway.   
I am an American. 
I was an American boy. 
I read the American Boy Magazine   
and became a boy scout   
in the suburbs. 
I thought I was Tom Sawyer   
catching crayfish in the Bronx River 
and imagining the Mississippi.   
I had a baseball mit 
and an American Flyer bike. 
I delivered the Woman's Home Companion   
at five in the afternoon 
or the Herald Trib 
at five in the morning. 
I still can hear the paper thump   
on lost porches. 
I had an unhappy childhood.   
I saw Lindbergh land. 
I looked homeward 
and saw no angel. 
I got caught stealing pencils 
from the Five and Ten Cent Store   
the same month I made Eagle Scout. 
I chopped trees for the CCC   
and sat on them. 
I landed in Normandy 
in a rowboat that turned over. 
I have seen the educated armies 
on the beach at Dover. 
I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple clouds   
shopkeepers rolling up their blinds   
at midday 
potato salad and dandelions 
at anarchist picnics. 
I am reading 'Lorna Doone' 
and a life of John Most 
terror of the industrialist 
a bomb on his desk at all times. 
I have seen the garbagemen parade   
in the Columbus Day Parade 
behind the glib 
farting trumpeters. 
I have not been out to the Cloisters   
in a long time 
nor to the Tuileries 
but I still keep thinking 
of going. 
I have seen the garbagemen parade   
when it was snowing. 
I have eaten hotdogs in ballparks. 
I have heard the Gettysburg Address   
and the Ginsberg Address. 
I like it here 
and I won't go back 
where I came from. 
I too have ridden boxcars boxcars boxcars.   
I have travelled among unknown men.   
I have been in Asia 
with Noah in the Ark. 
I was in India 
when Rome was built. 
I have been in the Manger 
with an Ass. 
I have seen the Eternal Distributor   
from a White Hill 
in South San Francisco 
and the Laughing Woman at Loona Park   
outside the Fun House 
in a great rainstorm 
still laughing. 
I have heard the sound of revelry   
by night. 
I have wandered lonely 
as a crowd. 
I am leading a quiet life 
outside of Mike's Place every day   
watching the world walk by 
in its curious shoes. 
I once started out 
to walk around the world 
but ended up in Brooklyn. 
That Bridge was too much for me.   
I have engaged in silence 
exile and cunning. 
I flew too near the sun 
and my wax wings fell off. 
I am looking for my Old Man   
whom I never knew. 
I am looking for the Lost Leader   
with whom I flew. 
Young men should be explorers.   
Home is where one starts from.   
But Mother never told me 
there'd be scenes like this. 
Womb-weary 
I rest 
I have travelled. 
I have seen goof city. 
I have seen the mass mess. 
I have heard Kid Ory cry. 
I have heard a trombone preach.   
I have heard Debussy 
strained thru a sheet. 
I have slept in a hundred islands 
where books were trees.   
I have heard the birds   
that sound like bells. 
I have worn grey flannel trousers 
and walked upon the beach of hell. 
I have dwelt in a hundred cities 
where trees were books. 
What subways what taxis what cafes! 
What women with blind breasts 
limbs lost among skyscrapers! 
I have seen the statues of heroes 
at carrefours. 
Danton weeping at a metro entrance 
Columbus in Barcelona 
pointing Westward up the Ramblas 
toward the American Express   
Lincoln in his stony chair   
And a great Stone Face   
in North Dakota. 
I know that Columbus   
did not invent America. 
I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra Pounds.   
They should all be freed.   
It is long since I was a herdsman. 
I am leading a quiet life   
in Mike's Place every day   
reading the Classified columns. 
I have read the Reader's Digest 
from cover to cover 
and noted the close identification 
of the United States and the Promised Land 
where every coin is marked   
In God We Trust 
but the dollar bills do not have it 
being gods unto themselves.   
I read the Want Ads daily   
looking for a stone a leaf   
an unfound door. 
I hear America singing 
in the Yellow Pages. 
One could never tell 
the soul has its rages. 
I read the papers every day   
and hear humanity amiss 
in the sad plethora of print. 
I see where Walden Pond has been drained   
to make an amusement park.   
I see they're making Melville   
eat his whale. 
I see another war is coming   
but I won't be there to fight it.   
I have read the writing 
on the outhouse wall. 
I helped Kilroy write it. 
I marched up Fifth Avenue 
blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon   
but hurried back to the Casbah   
looking for my dog. 
I see a similarity 
between dogs and me. 
Dogs are the true observers   
walking up and down the world   
thru the Molloy country. 
I have walked down alleys   
too narrow for Chryslers. 
I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons   
in a vacant lot in Astoria. 
Ben Shahn never painted them   
but they're there 
askew in Astoria. 
I have heard the junkman's obbligato.   
I have ridden superhighways   
and believed the billboard's promises   
Crossed the Jersey Flats 
and seen the Cities of the Plain 
And wallowed in the wilds of Westchester 
with its roving bands of natives 
in stationwagons. 
I have seen them. 
I am the man.   
I was there.   
I suffered 
somewhat. 
I am an American. 
I have a passport. 
I did not suffer in public. 
And I'm too young to die. 
I am a selfmade man. 
And I have plans for the future. 
I am in line   
for a top job. 
I may be moving on 
to Detroit. 
I am only temporarily 
a tie salesman. 
I am a good Joe. 
I am an open book 
to my boss. 
I am a complete mystery 
to my closest friends. 
I am leading a quiet life 
in Mike's Place every day   
contemplating my navel. 
I am a part 
of the body's long madness. 
I have wandered in various nightwoods.   
I have leaned in drunken doorways. 
I have written wild stories 
without punctuation. 
I am the man. 
I was there.   
I suffered   
somewhat. 
I have sat in an uneasy chair. 
I am a tear of the sun.   
I am a hill 
where poets run. 
I invented the alphabet 
after watching the flight of cranes   
who made letters with their legs. 
I am a lake upon a plain.   
I am a word 
in a tree. 
I am a hill of poetry.   
I am a raid 
on the inarticulate. 
I have dreamt 
that all my teeth fell out   
but my tongue lived   
to tell the tale. 
For I am a still 
of poetry. 
I am a bank of song.   
I am a playerpiano 
in an abandoned casino   
on a seaside esplanade   
in a dense fog 
still playing. 
I see a similarity 
between the Laughing Woman 
and myself. 
I have heard the sound of summer   
in the rain. 
I have seen girls on boardwalks   
have complicated sensations.   
I understand their hesitations. 
I am a gatherer of fruit.   
I have seen how kisses   
cause euphoria. 
I have risked enchantment.   
I have seen the Virgin   
in an appletree at Chartres 
And Saint Joan burn 
at the Bella Union. 
I have seen giraffes in junglejims 
their necks like love 
wound around the iron circumstances   
of the world. 
I have seen the Venus Aphrodite   
armless in her drafty corridor.   
I have heard a siren sing   
at One Fifth Avenue. 
I have seen the White Goddess dancing   
in the Rue des Beaux Arts   
on the Fourteenth of July   
and the Beautiful Dame Without Mercy   
picking her nose in Chumley's.   
She did not speak English.   
She had yellow hair 
and a hoarse voice 
I am leading a quiet life   
in Mike's Place every day   
watching the pocket pool players   
making the minestrone scene   
wolfing the macaronis   
and I have read somewhere   
the Meaning of Existence   
yet have forgotten 
just exactly where. 
But I am the man 
And I'll be there. 
And I may cause the lips   
of those who are asleep   
to speak. 
And I may make my notebooks   
into sheaves of grass.   
And I may write my own   
eponymous epitaph 
instructing the horsemen   
to pass.

Down by the salley gardens 
   my love and I did meet; 
She passed the salley gardens 
   with little snow-white feet. 
She bid me take love easy, 
   as the leaves grow on the tree; 
But I, being young and foolish, 
   with her would not agree. 

In a field by the river 
   my love and I did stand, 
And on my leaning shoulder 
   she laid her snow-white hand. 
She bid me take life easy, 
   as the grass grows on the weirs; 
But I was young and foolish, 
   and now am full of tears.

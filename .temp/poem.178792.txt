Sung on the occasion of decorating the graves of the Confederate dead, at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S. C., 1866
Sleep sweetly in your humble graves,
   Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause!--
Though yet no marble column craves
   The pilgrim here to pause.

In seeds of laurels in the earth,
   The garlands of your fame are sown;
And, somewhere, waiting for its birth, 
   The shaft is in the stone.

Meanwhile, your sisters for the years
   Which hold in trust your storied tombs, 
Bring all they now can give you--tears,
   And these memorial blooms.

Small tributes, but your shades will smile
   As proudly on these wreaths to-day, 
As when some cannon-moulded pile
   Shall overlook this Bay.

Stoop, angels, hither from the skies! 
   There is no holier spot of ground, 
Than where defeated valor lies
   By mourning beauty crowned.

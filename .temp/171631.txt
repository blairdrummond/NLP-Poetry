 
Sing a song of sixpence, 
A pocket full of rye, 
Four and twenty blackbirds 
Baked in a pie. 

When the pie was opened 
The birds began to sing-- 
Wasn't that a dainty dish 
To set before the king? 

The king was in the counting-house 
Counting out his money, 
The queen was in the parlor 
Eating bread and honey, 

The maid was in the garden 
Hanging out the clothes. 
Along came a blackbird 
And snipped off her nose.

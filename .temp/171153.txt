 
marches in uniform down the traffic stripe 
at the center of the street, counts time 
to the unseen web that has rearranged 
the air around him, his left hand 
stiff as a leather strap along his side, 
the other saluting right through the decades 
as if they weren't there, as if everyone under ninety 
were pervasive fog the morning would dispel 
in its own good time, as if the high school band 
all flapping thighs and cuffs behind him 
were as ghostly as the tumbleweed on every road 
dead-ended in the present, all the ancient infantry 
shoulder right, through a skein of bone, presenting arms 
across the drift, nothing but empty graves now 
to round off another century, 
the sweet honey of the old cadence, the streets 
going by at attention, the banners glistening with dew, 
the wives and children blowing kisses.

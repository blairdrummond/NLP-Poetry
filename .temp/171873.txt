 
Thinking of rain clouds that rose over the city   
on the first day of the year 

in the same month 
I consider that I have lived daily and with 

eyes open and ears to hear 
these years across from St Vincent's Hospital   
above whose roof those clouds rose 

its bricks by day a French red under 
cross facing south 
blown-up neo-classic facades the tall 
dark openings between columns at 
the dawn of history   
exploded into many windows 
in a mortised face 

inside it the ambulances have unloaded 
after sirens' howling nearer through traffic on   
Seventh Avenue long 
ago I learned not to hear them 
even when the sirens stop 

they turn to back in 
few passers-by stay to look   
and neither do I 

at night two long blue 
windows and one short one on the top floor   
burn all night 
many nights when most of the others are out   
on what floor do they have 
anything 

I have seen the building drift moonlit through geraniums   
late at night when trucks were few 
moon just past the full 
upper windows parts of the sky 
as long as I looked 
I watched it at Christmas and New Year 
early in the morning I have seen the nurses ray out through   
arterial streets 
in the evening have noticed internes blocks away 
on doorsteps one foot in the door 

I have come upon the men in gloves taking out   
the garbage at all hours   
piling up mountains of 
plastic bags white strata with green intermingled and 
black 
I have seen one pile 
catch fire and studied the cloud 
at the ends of the jets of the hoses 
the fire engines as near as that 
red beacons and 
machine-throb heard by the whole body 
I have noticed molded containers stacked outside   
a delivery entrance on Twelfth Street 
whether meals from a meal factory made up with those   
mummified for long journeys by plane 
or specimens for laboratory 
examination sealed at the prescribed temperatures   
either way closed delivery 

and approached faces staring from above   
crutches or tubular clamps 
out for tentative walks 
have paused for turtling wheel-chairs 
heard visitors talking in wind on each corner   
while the lights changed and 
hot dogs were handed over at the curb   
in the middle of afternoon 
mustard ketchup onions and relish 
and police smelling of ether and laundry   
were going back 

and I have known them all less than the papers of our days   
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have an incinerator 
what for 
how warm do they believe they have to maintain the air 
in there 
several of the windows appear   
to be made of tin 
but it may be the light reflected 

I have imagined bees coming and going 
on those sills though I have never seen them 

who was St Vincent

 
They explained to me the bloody bandages 
On the floor in the maternity ward in Rochester, N.Y.,   
Cured the backache I acquired bowing to my old master,   
Made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed. 

They showed me an officer on horseback, 
Waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse   
And a barefoot woman in a nightgown, 
Throwing stones after him and calling him Lucifer. 

I was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls.   
Come dark a chicken would roost in my hair.   
Some even laid eggs as I played my ukulele   
And my mother and father crossed themselves. 

Next, I saw myself inside an abandoned gas station   
Constructing a spaceship out of a coffin, 
Red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers, 
When a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear. 

Some days, however, they opened door after door,   
Always to a different room, and could not find me.   
There'd be only a small squeak now and then,   
As if a miner's canary got caught in a mousetrap.

 
The woodpecker keeps returning 
to drill the house wall. 
Put a pie plate over one place, he chooses another. 

There is nothing good to eat there: 
he has found in the house 
a resonant billboard to post his intentions, 
his voluble strength as provider. 

But where is the female he drums for? Where? 

I ask this, who am myself the ruined siding, 
the handsome red-capped bird, the missing mate.

Oft, when my lips I open to rehearse 
Thy wondrous spell of wisdom, and of power, 
And that my voice, and thy immortal verse, 
On listening ears, and hearts, I mingled pour, 
I shrink dismayed - and awful doth appear 
The vain presumption of my own weak deed; 
Thy glorious spirit seems to mine so near, 
That suddenly I tremble as I read - 
Thee an invisible auditor I fear: 
Oh, if it might be so, my master dear! 
With what beseeching would I pray to thee, 
To make me equal to my noble task, 
Succor from thee, how humbly would I ask, 
Thy worthiest works to utter worthily.

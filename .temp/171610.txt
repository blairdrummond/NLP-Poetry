 
I had a little brother 
And I brought him to my mother 
And I said I want another 
Little brother for a change. 
But she said don't be a bother 
So I took him to my father 
And I said this little bother 
Of a brother's very strange. 
But he said one little brother 
Is exactly like another 
And every little brother 
Misbehaves a bit he said. 
So I took the little bother 
From my mother and my father 
And I put the little bother 
Of a brother back to bed.

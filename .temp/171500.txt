 
The renewal project is doomed: because 
its funding board's vice-president resigned: because   
the acids of divorce were eating day-long   
at her stomach, at her thoughts: because 
her husband was neglecting her, in favor of his daughter, 
who was dying: because her husband, 
bi and edgy, bore an AIDS sore that was ripe   
enough with fear and woe to throw this whole   
thick network of connections off its balance 
and down a hole of human misery. Haven't we seen it happen?   
--when a crowded room at a party was tilted   
perilously askew by the weight of two   
wept tears that weren't as large as a housefly's wings,   
that couldn't have filled a pistachio shell.

You little stars that live in skies 
And glory in Apollo's glory, 
In whose aspects conjoined lies 
The heaven's will and nature's story, 
Joy to be likened to those eyes, 
Which eyes make all eyes glad or sorry; 
   For when you force thoughts from above, 
   These overrule your force by love. 

And thou, O Love, which in these eyes 
Hast married Reason with Affection, 
And made them saints of Beauty's skies, 
Where joys are shadows of perfection, 
Lend me thy wings that I may rise 
Up, not by worth, but thy election; 
   For I have vowed in strangest fashion 
   To love and never seek compassion.

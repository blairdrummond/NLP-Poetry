 
I am no shepherd of a child's surmises. 
I have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises, 

Thirst where the grasses burn in early May 
And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay. 

There is dust in this air. I saw in the heat 
Grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat. 

So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I drove 
To blizzards sifting on the hissing stove, 

And found no images of pastoral will, 
But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill.

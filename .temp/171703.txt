 
for Larry Levis
So it is here, then, after so long, and after all-- 
as the light turns in the leaves in the old golden   
way of fall, 
                   as the small beasts dig to the place 
at the roots where survival waits, cowardly crouching   
in the dark, 
                   as the branches begin to stretch into winter,   
freed of their cheerful burden of green, then 

      it comes home, the flea-ridden bitch of desolation,   
a thin dog with its ribs exposed like a lesson 
in mathematics, in subtraction; it comes home, to find its bowl   
empty--then the numberless 
things for which to be grateful dissolve 
like the steam from a fire just doused with water 
on a day of overcast grays, lined 
by a cold slanting rain-- 
                                     it is October, that season when Death   
goes public, costumed, when the talking heads 
on the TV screen float up smiling at the terrible 
news, their skin alight with the same strange glow 
fish give off when they have been dead a week or more,   
as the gas company adds odor for warning 
that the lines may be leaking, the sweet smell of disaster   
hanging, invisible, in the air, a moment 
before you strike the match-- 

it is then, brother, that I think of you, of your Caravaggio,   
of the head of Goliath swung by its hair, 
wearing the artist's own weary expression, 
exhausted of everything but its desire 
for that beautiful David he used to be; and I think   
of all the boys walking the streets 
each carrying the severed head of the man 
he will become--and the way I bear it is 
to think of you, grinning, riding high in the cart leaving   
the scene, a pair of huge horses hauling the wagon,   
a fine mist rising from their damp shoulders,   
unconcerned with what hangs, nailed 
to the museum walls--luckily 
the fall of Icarus has nothing to do with them,   
nor the ruined Goliath who fell like a forest, 
nor the wretched Salomes with their blood-splattered   
platters, nor the huge stone griffins sobbing 
at the gates to Valhalla as the litters are carried past ... 

the dark eyes of the horses are opaque with wisdom, 
their hoofs strike the pavements with such a musical decision,   
the derisive curl of their lips is so like the mysterious   
smile on the angel at Chartres, on Kuan Yin, on the dolphin,   
as they pull the cart safe through the blizzards   
of Main Street, the snow slowly swallowing the signs   
though the crossing light beckons-- 
a soft glowing green like some spectral Eden   
in the blank white swirl of the storm. 

The stallion neighs once, sends a warm cloud   
of breath into the snow-filled air, 
and the mare isn't scared yet--at least   
she's still pulling. There's a barn out there   
somewhere, as they plow through the light's   
yellow aura of caution, its warm glow 
foretelling what hides in the storm: 
a stall full of gold, where the soul-- 
that magician--can wallow 
and winter in straw.

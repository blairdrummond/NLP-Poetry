 
The most popular "act" in 
Penn Station 
is the three black kids in ratty   
sneakers & T-shirts playing 
two violins and a cello--Brahms.   
White men in business suits 
have already dug into their pockets   
as they pass and they toss in   
a dollar or two without stopping.   
Brown men in work-soiled khakis   
stand with their mouths open,   
arms crossed on their bellies   
as if they themselves have always   
wanted to attempt those bars.   
One white boy, three, sits 
cross-legged in front of his 
idols--in ecstasy-- 
their slick, dark faces, 
their thin, wiry arms, 
who must begin to look 
like angels! 
Why does this trembling 
pull us? 
A: Beneath the surface we are one. 
B: Amazing! I did not think that they could speak this tongue.

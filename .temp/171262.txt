 
How will it go, crumbling earthquake, towering inferno, juggernaut, volcano, smashup, 
in reality, other than the feverish nearreal fantasy of the capitalist flunky film hacks 
tho they sense its reality breathing a quake inferno scar on their throat even snorts of 
100% pure cocaine cant cancel the cold cut of impending death to this society. On all the 
screens of america, the joint blows up every hour and a half for two dollars an fifty cents. 
They have taken the niggers out to lunch, for a minute, made us partners nigger Charlie) or 
surrogates (boss nigger) for their horror. But just as superafrikan mobutu cannot leop 
    ardskinhat his 
way out of responsibility for lumumba's death, nor even with his incredible billions 
    rockefeller 
cannot even save his pale ho's titties in the crushing weight of   
things as they really are. 
How will it go, does it reach you, getting up, sitting on the side   
of the bed, getting ready to go to work.   Hypnotized by the ma- 
chine, and the cement floor, the jungle treachery of 
    trying 
to survive with no money in a money world, of making the boss   
100,000 for every 200 
    dollars 
you get, and then having his brother get you for the rent, and if 
you want to buy the car 
    you 
helped build, your downpayment paid for it, the rest goes to buy   
his old lady a foam 
    rubber 
rhinestone set of boobies for special occasions when kissinger   
drunkenly fumbles with her blouse, forgetting himself. 
If you don't like it, what you gonna do about it. That was the   
question we asked each 
    other, & 
still right regularly need to ask. You don't like it? Whatcha   
gonna do, about it?? 
The real terror of nature is humanity enraged, the true   
technicolor spectacle that 
    hollywood 
cant record. They cant even show you how you look when you   
go to work, or when you 
    come back. 
They cant even show you thinking or demanding the new so- 
cialist reality, its the ultimate 
    tidal 
wave. When all over the planet, men and women, with heat in   
their hands, demand that 
    society 
be planned to include the lives and self determination of all the   
people ever to live. That is the scalding scenario with a cast of   
just under two billion that they dare not even whisper. Its called,   
"We Want It All . . . The Whole World!"

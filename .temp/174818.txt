 
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
         Beside the springs of Dove,
A Maid whom there were none to praise
         And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
         Half hidden from the eye!
--Fair as a star, when only one
         Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
         When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
         The difference to me!

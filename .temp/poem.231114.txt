I have to thank God I'm a woman, 
For in these ordered days a woman only 
Is free to be very hungry, very lonely. 

It is sad for Feminism, but still clear 
That man, more often than woman, is pioneer. 
If I would confide a new thought, 
First to a man must it be brought. 

Now, for our sins, it is my bitter fate 
That such a man wills soon to be my mate, 
And so of friendship is quick end: 
When I have gained a love I lose a friend. 

It is well within the order of things 
That man should listen when his mate sings; 
But the true male never yet walked 
Who liked to listen when his mate talked. 

I would be married to a full man, 
As would all women since the world began; 
But from a wealth of living I have proved 
I must be silent, if I would be loved. 

Now of my silence I have much wealth, 
I have to do my thinking all by stealth. 
My thoughts may never see the day; 
My mind is like a catacomb where early Christians pray. 

And of my silence I have much pain, 
But of these pangs I have great gain; 
For I must take to drugs or drink, 
Or I must write the things I think. 

If my sex would let me speak, 
I would be very lazy and most weak; 
I should speak only, and the things I spoke 
Would fill the air awhile, and clear like smoke. 

The things I think now I write down, 
And some day I will show them to the Town. 
When I am sad I make thought clear; 
I can re-read it all next year. 

I have to thank God I'm a woman, 
For in these ordered days a woman only 
Is free to be very hungry, very lonely.

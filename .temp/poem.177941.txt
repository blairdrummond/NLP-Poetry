AMETAS 
Think'st thou that this love can stand, 
Whilst thou still dost say me nay? 
Love unpaid does soon disband: 
Love binds love as hay binds hay.

2
THESTYLIS 
Think'st thou that this rope would twine 
If we both should turn one way?
Where both parties so combine,
Neither love will twist nor hay.

3
AMETAS 
Thus you vain excuses find, 
Which yourselves and us delay: 
And love ties a woman's mind 
Looser than with ropes of hay.

4
THESTYLIS 
What you cannot constant hope 
Must be taken as you may.

5
AMETAS 
Then let's both lay by our rope, 
And go kiss within the hay.

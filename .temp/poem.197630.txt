"A equals X," says Mister One.   
"A equals B," says Mister Two.   
"A equals nothing under the sun   
But A," says Mister Three. A few   
Applaud; some wipe their eyes;   
Some linger in the shade to see   
One and Two in neat disguise   
Decapitating Mister Three. 

"This age is not entirely bad." 
It's bad enough, God knows, but you   
Should know Elizabethans had   
Sweeneys and Mrs. Porters too.   
The past goes down and disappears,   
The present stumbles home to bed,   
The future stretches out in years 
That no one knows, and you'll be dead.

I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie, 
Whenever, wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die -- 
Whether he die in the light o' day or under the peak-faced moon; 
In cabin or dance-hall, camp or dive, mucklucks or patent shoon; 
On velvet tundra or virgin peak, by glacier, drift or draw; 
In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom, by avalanche, fang or claw; 
By battle, murder or sudden wealth, by pestilence, hooch or lead -- 
I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead. 

For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss, and his mind was mighty sot 
On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized boneyard lot. 
And where he died or how he died, it didn't matter a damn 
So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone "epigram." 
So I promised him, and he paid the price in good cheechako coin 
(Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin). 
Then I painted a three-foot slab of pine: "Here lies poor Bill MacKie," 
And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die. 

Years passed away, and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange, 
Of a long-deserted line of traps 'way back of the Bighorn range, 
Of a little hut by the great divide, and a white man stiff and still, 
Lying there by his lonesome self, and I figured it must be Bill. 
So I thought of the contract I'd made with him, and I took down from the shelf 
The swell black box with the silver plate he'd picked out for hisself; 
And I packed it full of grub and "hooch," and I slung it on the sleigh; 
Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day. 

You know what it's like in the Yukon wild when it's sixty-nine below; 
When the ice-worms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow; 
When the pine-trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood, 
And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood; 
When the stove-pipe smoke breaks sudden off, and the sky is weirdly lit, 
And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a red-hot spit; 
When the mercury is a frozen ball, and the frost-fiend stalks to kill -- 
Well, it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill. 

Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand, 
As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land; 
Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heartbreaking woes, 
And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows! 
North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain 
Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again. 

River and plain and mighty peak -- and who could stand unawed? 
As their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God. 
North, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes, 
And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes, 
Till at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill, 
And I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill. 

Ice, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall; 
Ice on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all; 
Sparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair, 
Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare; 
Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread. 
I gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him, and I gazed at the gruesome dead, 
And at last I spoke: "Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes, 
A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies." 

Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole, 
With a little coffin six by three and a grief you can't control? 
Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin, 
And that seems to say: "You may try all day, but you'll never jam me in"? 
I'm not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue 
As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I'd do. 
Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about, 
And I lit a roaring fire in the stove, and I started to thaw Bill out. 

Well, I thawed and thawed for thirteen days, but it didn't seem no good; 
His arms and legs stuck out like pegs, as if they was made of wood. 
Till at last I said: "It ain't no use -- he's froze too hard to thaw; 
He's obstinate, and he won't lie straight, so I guess I got to -- saw." 
So I sawed off poor Bill's arms and legs, and I laid him snug and straight 
In the little coffin he picked hisself, with the dinky silver plate, 
And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down; 
Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh, and I started back to town. 

So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep, 
And there he's waiting the Great Clean-up, when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep; 
And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun, 
And sometimes I wonder if they was, the awful things I done. 
And as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Law, 
I often think of poor old Bill -- and how hard he was to saw.

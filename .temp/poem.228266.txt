The earth builds on the earth 
Castles and towers;  
The earth saith of the earth:  
All shall be ours. 

            Yea, though they plan and reap
            The rye and the corn,
            Lo, they were bond to Sleep
            Ere they were born.

            Yea, though the blind earth sows
            For the fruit and the sheaf,
            They shall harvest the leaf of the rose
            And the dust of the leaf.

            Pride of the sword and power
            Are theirs at their need
            Who shall rule but the root of the flower
            The fall of the seed.

            They who follow the flesh
            In splendour and tears,
            They shall rest and clothe them afresh
            In the fulness of years.

            From the dream of the dust they came
            As the dawn set free.
            They shall pass as the flower of the flame
            Or the foam of the sea.

                        The earth builds on the earth 
                        Castles and towers. 
                        The earth saith of the earth: 
                        All shall be ours.

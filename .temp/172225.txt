 
There we go in cars, did you guess we wore sandals?   
Carrying the till, memorizing its numbers,   
apt at the essential such as rearranging   
languages. They occur from route to route   
like savages who wear shells. 

"I cannot place him." Yet I do. 
He must ascend indefinitely as airs 
he must regard his image as plastic, 
adhering to the easeful carpet that needs   
footprints and cares for them 
as is their wont in houses, the ones we pass by. 

Such a day/or such a night   
reeling from cabin to cabin 
looking at the cakewalk or merely dancing. 
These adventures in broad/or slim 
lamplight, 

                                     Yet the cars 
do not cheat, even their colors perform in storm.   
We never feel the scratch, they do. 
When lightning strikes it's safer to ride 
on rubber going down a mountain, 
safer than trees, or sand, more preventive   
to be hid in a cloud we sing, remembering 

The old manse and robins. One tear, 
a salty one knowing we have escaped 
the charm of being native. Even as your glance   
through the windshield tells me you've seen   
another mishap of nature 

                                     you would willingly forget,   
prefer to be like him near the hearth 
where woodsmoke makes a screen of numbers and signs   
where the bedstead it's not so foreign as this lake. 

                                     The plateau, excursionist, 
is ahead. After that twenty volumes   
of farmland. Then I must guide us 
to the wood garage someone has whitened   
where the light enters through one window   
like a novel. You must peer at it   
without weakening, without feeling   
hero, or heroine, 

                                     Understanding the distances   
between characters, their wakeful 
or sleep searchingness, as far from the twilight ring   
the slow sunset, the quick dark.

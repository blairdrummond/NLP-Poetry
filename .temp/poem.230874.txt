These be two 
Country women. 
What a size! 
Great big arms 
And round red faces; 
Big substantial 
Sit down places; 
Great big bosoms firm as cheese 
Bursting through their country jackets; 
Wide big laps 
And sturdy knees; 
Hands outspread, 
Round and rosy, 
Hands to hold 
A country posy 
Or a baby or a lamb-- 
      And such eyes! 
Stupid, shifty, small and sly 
Peeping through a slit of sty, 
Squinting through their neighbours' plackets.

 
Lightning hits the roof,   
shoves the knife, darkness,   
deep in the walls. 
They bleed light all over us   
and your face, the fan, folds up,   
so I won't see how afraid   
to be with me you are. 
We don't mix, even in bed,   
where we keep ending up.   
There's no need to hide it:   
you're snow, I'm coal, 
I've got the scars to prove it.   
But open your mouth, 
I'll give you a taste of black   
you won't forget. 
For a while, I'll let it make you strong, 
make your heart lion, 
then I'll take it back.

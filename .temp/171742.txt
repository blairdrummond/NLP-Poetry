 
These alternate nights and days, these seasons   
Somehow fail to convince me. It seems   
I have the sense of infinity! 

(In your dreams, O crew of Columbus,   
O listeners over the sea 
For the surf that breaks upon Nothing--) 

Once I was waked by the nightingales in the garden.   
I thought, What time is it? I thought,   
Time--Is it Time still?--Now is it Time? 

(Tell me your dreams, O sailors:   
Tell me, in sleep did you climb   
The tall masts, and before you--) 

At night the stillness of old trees   
Is a leaning over and the inertness   
Of hills is a kind of waiting. 

(In sleep, in a dream, did you see   
The world's end? Did the water 
Break--and no shore--Did you see?) 

Strange faces come through the streets to me   
Like messengers: and I have been warned   
By the moving slowly of hands at a window. 

Oh, I have the sense of infinity--   
But the world, sailors, is round.   
They say there is no end to it.

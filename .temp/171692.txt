 
It hangs from heaven to earth. 
There are trees in it, cities, rivers,   
small pigs and moons. In one corner 
the snow falling over a charging cavalry,   
in another women are planting rice. 

You can also see: 
a chicken carried off by a fox, 
a naked couple on their wedding night, 
a column of smoke, 
an evil-eyed woman spitting into a pail of milk. 

What is behind it? 
--Space, plenty of empty space. 

And who is talking now? 
--A man asleep under his hat. 

What happens when he wakes up? 
--He'll go into a barbershop. 
They'll shave his beard, nose, ears, and hair,   
To make him look like everyone else.

Oh fairest of the rural maids!
 Thy birth was in the forest shades;
 Green boughs, and glimpses of the sky,
 Were all that met thine infant eye.


 Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child,
 Were even in the sylvan wild;
 And all the beauty of the place
 Is in thy heart and on thy face.


 The twilight of the trees and rocks
 Is in the light shade of thy locks;
 Thy step is as the wind, that weaves
 Its playful way among the leaves.


 Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene
 And silent waters heaven is seen;
 Their lashes are the herbs that look
 On their young figures in the brook.


 The forest depths, by foot unpressed,
 Are not more sinless than thy breast;
 The holy peace, that fills the air
 Of those calm solitudes, is there.

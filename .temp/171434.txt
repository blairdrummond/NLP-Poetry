 
They will soon be down 

To one, but he still will be 
For a little while    still will be stopping 

The flakes in the air with a look, 
Surrounding himself with the silence 
Of whitening snarls. Let him eat 
The last red meal of the condemned 

To extinction, tearing the guts 

From an elk. Yet that is not enough 
For me. I would have him eat 

The heart, and from it, have an idea 
Stream into his gnarling head 
That he no longer has a thing 
To lose, and so can walk 

Out into the open, in the full 

Pale of the sub-Arctic sun 
Where a single spruce tree is dying 

Higher and higher. Let him climb it 
With all his meanness and strength. 
Lord, we have come to the end 
Of this kind of vision of heaven, 

As the sky breaks open 

Its fans around him and shimmers 
And into its northern gates he rises 

Snarling    complete    in the joy of a weasel 
With an elk's horned heart in his stomach 
Looking straight into the eternal 
Blue, where he hauls his kind. I would have it all 

My way: at the top of that tree I place 

The New World's last eagle 
Hunched in mangy feathers    giving 

Up on the theory of flight. 
Dear God of the wildness of poetry, let them mate 
To the death in the rotten branches, 
Let the tree sway and burst into flame 

And mingle them, crackling with feathers, 

In crownfire. Let something come 
Of it    something gigantic    legendary 

Rise beyond reason over hills 
Of ice    screaming    that it cannot die, 
That it has come back, this time 
On wings, and will spare no earthly thing: 

That it will hover, made purely of northern 

Lights, at dusk    and fall 
On men building roads: will perch 

On the moose's horn like a falcon 
Riding into battle    into holy war against 
Screaming railroad crews: will pull 
Whole traplines like fibres from the snow 

In the long-jawed night of fur trappers. 

But, small, filthy, unwinged, 
You will soon be crouching 

Alone, with maybe some dim racial notion 
Of being the last, but none of how much 
Your unnoticed going will mean: 
How much the timid poem needs 

The mindless explosion of your rage, 

The glutton's internal fire    the elk's 
Heart in the belly, sprouting wings, 

The pact of the "blind swallowing 
Thing," with himself, to eat 
The world, and not to be driven off it 
Until it is gone, even if it takes 

Forever. I take you as you are 

And make of you what I will, 
Skunk-bear, carcajoy, bloodthirsty 

Non-survivor. 
                        Lord, let me die    but not die 
Out.

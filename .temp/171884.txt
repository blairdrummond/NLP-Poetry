 
Stare hard enough at the fabric of night,   
and if you're predisposed to dark--let's say   
the window you've picked is a black 
postage stamp you spend hours at, 
sleepless, drinking gin after the I Love   
Lucy reruns have gone off--stare 

like your eyes have force, and behind 
any night's taut scrim will come the forms   
you expect pressing from the other side.   
For you: a field of skulls, angled jaws 
and eye-sockets, a zillion scooped-out crania.   
They're plain once you think to look. 

You know such fields exist, for criminals 
roam your very block, and even history lists   
monsters like Adolf and Uncle Joe 
who stalk the earth's orb, plus minor baby-eaters   
unidentified, probably in your very midst. Perhaps   
that disgruntled mail clerk from your job 

has already scratched your name on a bullet--that's him   
rustling in the azaleas. You caress the thought, 
for it proves there's no better spot for you 
than here, your square-yard of chintz sofa, hearing   
the bad news piped steady from your head. The night   
is black. You stare and furious stare, 

confident there are no gods out there. In this way,   
you're blind to your own eye's intricate machine   
and to the light it sees by, to the luck of birth and all   
your remembered loves. If the skulls are there-- 
let's say they do press toward you 
against night's scrim--could they not stare 
with slack jawed envy at the fine flesh 
that covers your scalp, the numbered hairs,   
at the force your hands hold?

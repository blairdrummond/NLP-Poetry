"Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light, 
Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffus'd 
A Spirit of activity and life, 
That knows no term, cessation, or decay; 
That fades not when the lamp of earthly life, 
Extinguish'd in the dampness of the grave, 
Awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe 
In the dim newness of its being feels 
The impulses of sublunary things, 
And all is wonder to unpractis'd sense: 
But, active, steadfast and eternal, still 
Guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars, 
Cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves, 
Strengthens in health, and poisons in disease; 
And in the storm of change, that ceaselessly 
Rolls round the eternal universe and shakes 
Its undecaying battlement, presides, 
Apportioning with irresistible law 
The place each spring of its machine shall fill; 
So that when waves on waves tumultuous heap 
Confusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven 
Heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords, 
Whilst, to the eye of shipwreck'd mariner, 
Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock, 
All seems unlink'd contingency and chance, 
No atom of this turbulence fulfils 
A vague and unnecessitated task, 
Or acts but as it must and ought to act. 
Even the minutest molecule of light, 
That in an April sunbeam's fleeting glow 
Fulfils its destin'd, though invisible work, 
The universal Spirit guides; nor less, 
When merciless ambition, or mad zeal, 
Has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield, 
That, blind, they there may dig each other's graves, 
And call the sad work glory, does it rule 
All passions: not a thought, a will, an act, 
No working of the tyrant's moody mind, 
Nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast 
Their servitude to hide the shame they feel, 
Nor the events enchaining every will, 
That from the depths of unrecorded time 
Have drawn all-influencing virtue, pass 
Unrecogniz'd or unforeseen by thee, 
Soul of the Universe! eternal spring 
Of life and death, of happiness and woe, 
Of all that chequers the phantasmal scene 
That floats before our eyes in wavering light, 
Which gleams but on the darkness of our prison, 
       Whose chains and massy walls 
       We feel, but cannot see. 

"Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, 
Necessity! thou mother of the world! 
Unlike the God of human error, thou 
Requir'st no prayers or praises; the caprice 
Of man's weak will belongs no more to thee 
Than do the changeful passions of his breast 
To thy unvarying harmony: the slave, 
Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world, 
And the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride 
His being in the sight of happiness 
That springs from his own works; the poison-tree, 
Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd up, 
And the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords 
A temple where the vows of happy love 
Are register'd, are equal in thy sight: 
No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge 
And favouritism, and worst desire of fame 
Thou know'st not: all that the wide world contains 
Are but thy passive instruments, and thou 
Regard'st them all with an impartial eye, 
Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel, 
         Because thou hast not human sense, 
         Because thou art not human mind. 

         "Yes! when the sweeping storm of time 
Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd fanes 
And broken altars of the almighty Fiend 
Whose name usurps thy honours, and the blood 
Through centuries clotted there has floated down 
The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live 
Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to thee, 
         Which, nor the tempest-breath of time, 
         Nor the interminable flood 
         Over earth's slight pageant rolling, 
                Availeth to destroy-- 
The sensitive extension of the world. 
         That wondrous and eternal fane, 
Where pain and pleasure, good and evil join, 
To do the will of strong necessity, 
         And life, in multitudinous shapes, 
Still pressing forward where no term can be, 
         Like hungry and unresting flame 
Curls round the eternal columns of its strength."

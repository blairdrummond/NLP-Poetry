(July, 1862)
Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill
      In prime of morn and May,
 Recall ye how McClellan's men
      Here stood at bay?
 While deep within yon forest dim
      Our rigid comrades lay--
 Some with the cartridge in their mouth,
 Others with fixed arms lifted South--
             Invoking so
 The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!


 The spires of Richmond, late beheld
      Through rifts in musket-haze,
 Were closed from view in clouds of dust
      On leaf-walled ways,
 Where streamed our wagons in caravan;
      And the Seven Nights and Days
 Of march and fast, retreat and fight,
 Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight--
             Does the elm wood
 Recall the haggard beards of blood?


 The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed
      We followed (it never fell!)--
 In silence husbanded our strength--
           Received their yell;
 Till on this slope we patient turned
      With cannon ordered well;
 Reverse we proved was not defeat;
 But ah, the sod what thousands meet!--
                Does Malvern Wood
 Bethink itself, and muse and brood?


                         We elms of Malvern Hill
                              Remember every thing;
                         But sap the twig will fill;
                         Wag the world how it will,
                              Leaves must be green in Spring.

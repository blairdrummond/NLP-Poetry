 
Mrs. Coley's three-flat brick 
Isn't here any more. 
All done with seeing her fat little form   
Burst out of the basement door; 
And with seeing her African son-in-law   
(Rightful heir to the throne) 
With his great white strong cold squares of teeth   
And his little eyes of stone; 
And with seeing the squat fat daughter   
Letting in the men 
When majesty has gone for the day-- 
And letting them out again.

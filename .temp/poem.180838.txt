Last night, as half asleep I dreaming lay, 
    Half naked came she in her little shift, 
         With tilted glass, and verses on her lips; 
Narcissus-eyes all shining for the fray, 
         Filled full of frolic to her wine-red lips, 
         Warm as a dewy rose, sudden she slips 
    Into my bed - just in her little shift. 

Said she, half naked, half asleep, half heard, 
With a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word, 
'Oh my old lover, do you sleep or wake!' 
And instant I sat upright for her sake, 
And drank whatever wine she poured for me -   
Wine of the tavern, or vintage it might be 
Of Heaven's own vine: he surely were a churl 
Who refused wine poured out by such a girl, 
A double traitor he to wine and love. 
Go to, thou puritan! the gods above 
Ordained this wine for us, but not for thee; 
Drunkards we are by a divine decree, 
Yea, by the special privilege of heaven 
Foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven.   

Ah! HAFIZ, you are not the only man 
    Who promised penitence and broke down after; 
For who can keep so hard a promise, man,   
    With wine and woman brimming o'er with laughter! 
O knotted locks, filled like a flower with scent, 
How have you ravished this poor penitent!

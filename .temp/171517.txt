 
For Cynthia  When he would not return to fine garments and good food, to his houses and his people, Loingseachan told him, "Your father is dead." "I'm sorry to hear it," he said. "Your mother is dead," said the lad. "All pity for me has gone out of the world." "Your sister, too, is dead." "The mild sun rests on every ditch," he said; "a sister loves even though not loved." "Suibhne, your daughter is dead." "And an only daughter is the needle of the heart." "And Suibhne, your little boy, who used to call you "Daddy"--he is dead." "Aye," said Suibhne, "that's the drop that brings a man to the ground."  He fell out of the yew tree; Loingseachan closed his arms around him and placed him in manacles. 
--AFTER THE MIDDLE-IRISH ROMANCE, THE MADNESS OF SUIBHNE


Child of my winter, born 
When the new fallen soldiers froze 
In Asia's steep ravines and fouled the snows,   
When I was torn 


By love I could not still, 
By fear that silenced my cramped mind 
To that cold war where, lost, I could not find   
My peace in my will, 

All those days we could keep 
Your mind a landscape of new snow 
Where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below,   
His fields asleep 

In their smooth covering, white 
As quilts to warm the resting bed 
Of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread   
For me to write, 

And thinks: Here lies my land 
Unmarked by agony, the lean foot 
Of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper's boot;   
And I have planned 

My chances to restrain 
The torments of demented summer or   
Increase the deepening harvest here before   
It snows again. 


    Late April and you are three; today 
         We dug your garden in the yard. 
    To curb the damage of your play, 
Strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling,   
    Four slender sticks of lath stand guard   
         Uplifting their thin string. 

    So you were the first to tramp it down. 
         And after the earth was sifted close   
    You brought your watering can to drown 
All earth and us. But these mixed seeds are pressed   
    With light loam in their steadfast rows. 
         Child, we've done our best. 

    Someone will have to weed and spread 
         The young sprouts. Sprinkle them in the hour   
    When shadow falls across their bed. 
You should try to look at them every day   
    Because when they come to full flower 
         I will be away. 


The child between them on the street   
Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet 
    And hangs on their hands. They start   
At the live weight and lurch together,   
Recoil to swing him through the weather, 
    Stiffen and pull apart. 

We read of cold war soldiers that 
Never gained ground, gave none, but sat   
    Tight in their chill trenches. 
Pain seeps up from some cavity 
Through the ranked teeth in sympathy;   
    The whole jaw grinds and clenches 

Till something somewhere has to give.   
It's better the poor soldiers live 
    In someone else's hands 
Than drop where helpless powers fall   
On crops and barns, on towns where all   
    Will burn. And no man stands. 

For good, they sever and divide 
Their won and lost land. On each side   
    Prisoners are returned 
Excepting a few unknown names.   
The peasant plods back and reclaims   
    His fields that strangers burned 

And nobody seems very pleased. 
It's best. Still, what must not be seized   
    Clenches the empty fist. 
I tugged your hand, once, when I hated   
Things less: a mere game dislocated   
    The radius of your wrist. 

Love's wishbone, child, although I've gone   
As men must and let you be drawn   
    Off to appease another, 
It may help that a Chinese play 
Or Solomon himself might say 
    I am your real mother. 


         No one can tell you why   
    the season will not wait; 
         the night I told you I 
must leave, you wept a fearful rate   
             to stay up late. 

         Now that it's turning Fall,   
    we go to take our walk 
         among municipal 
flowers, to steal one off its stalk,   
             to try and talk. 

         We huff like windy giants 
    scattering with our breath   
         gray-headed dandelions; 
Spring is the cold wind's aftermath. 
             The poet saith. 

         But the asters, too, are gray, 
    ghost-gray. Last night's cold   
         is sending on their way 
petunias and dwarf marigold, 
             hunched sick and old. 

         Like nerves caught in a graph,   
    the morning-glory vines 
         frost has erased by half 
still scrawl across their rigid twines.   
             Like broken lines 

         of verses I can't make. 
    In its unraveling loom 
         we find a flower to take, 
with some late buds that might still bloom,   
             back to your room. 

         Night comes and the stiff dew.   
    I'm told a friend's child cried   
         because a cricket, who 
had minstreled every night outside   
             her window, died. 


Winter again and it is snowing;   
Although you are still three,   
You are already growing 
Strange to me. 

You chatter about new playmates, sing   
Strange songs; you do not know   
Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 
Or where I go 

Or when I sang for bedtime, Fox 
Went out on a chilly night, 
Before I went for walks 
And did not write; 

You never mind the squalls and storms   
That are renewed long since; 
Outside the thick snow swarms 
Into my prints 

And swirls out by warehouses, sealed,   
Dark cowbarns, huddled, still, 
Beyond to the blank field, 
The fox's hill 

Where he backtracks and sees the paw,   
Gnawed off, he cannot feel; 
Conceded to the jaw 
Of toothed, blue steel. 


         Easter has come around 
    again; the river is rising 
         over the thawed ground 
    and the banksides. When you come you bring   
         an egg dyed lavender. 
    We shout along our bank to hear 
our voices returning from the hills to meet us.   
    We need the landscape to repeat us. 

         You lived on this bank first. 
    While nine months filled your term, we knew 
         how your lungs, immersed 
    in the womb, miraculously grew 
         their useless folds till 
    the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill 
them out like bushes thick with leaves. You took your hour,   
    caught breath, and cried with your full lung power. 

         Over the stagnant bight 
    we see the hungry bank swallow 
         flaunting his free flight 
    still; we sink in mud to follow 
         the killdeer from the grass 
    that hides her nest. That March there was 
rain; the rivers rose; you could hear killdeers flying   
    all night over the mudflats crying. 

         You bring back how the red- 
    winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings,   
         diving at my head-- 
    I saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings   
         in tall reeds that must sway 
    with the winds blowing every way. 
If you recall much, you recall this place. You still   
    live nearby--on the opposite hill. 

         After the sharp windstorm 
    of July Fourth, all that summer 
         through the gentle, warm 
    afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr 
         like iron locusts. Crews 
    of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose 
branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free   
    all the torn limbs that could sap the tree. 

         In the debris lay 
    starlings, dead. Near the park's birdrun 
         we surprised one day 
    a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon. 
         In my hands she flapped so 
    fearfully that I let her go. 
Her keeper came. And we helped snarl her in a net.   
    You bring things I'd as soon forget. 

         You raise into my head 
    a Fall night that I came once more 
         to sit on your bed; 
    sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore- 
         head and you wheezed for breath, 
    for help, like some child caught beneath 
its comfortable woolly blankets, drowning there.   
    Your lungs caught and would not take the air. 

         Of all things, only we 
    have power to choose that we should die;   
             nothing else is free 
    in this world to refuse it. Yet I, 
         who say this, could not raise   
    myself from bed how many days 
to the thieving world. Child, I have another wife,   
    another child. We try to choose our life. 


Here in the scuffled dust 
    is our ground of play. 
I lift you on your swing and must   
    shove you away, 
see you return again, 
    drive you off again, then 

stand quiet till you come. 
    You, though you climb   
higher, farther from me, longer, 
    will fall back to me stronger.   
Bad penny, pendulum, 
    you keep my constant time 

to bob in blue July 
    where fat goldfinches fly 
over the glittering, fecund   
    reach of our growing lands. 
Once more now, this second, 
    I hold you in my hands. 


I thumped on you the best I could   
         which was no use; 
you would not tolerate your food   
until the sweet, fresh milk was soured   
         with lemon juice. 

That puffed you up like a fine yeast. 
    The first June in your yard 
like some squat Nero at a feast 
you sat and chewed on white, sweet clover.   
         That is over. 

When you were old enough to walk   
         we went to feed 
the rabbits in the park milkweed;   
saw the paired monkeys, under lock,   
    consume each other's salt. 

Going home we watched the slow   
stars follow us down Heaven's vault. 
You said, let's catch one that comes low, 
         pull off its skin 
    and cook it for our dinner. 

    As absentee bread-winner, 
I seldom got you such cuisine; 
we ate in local restaurants 
or bought what lunches we could pack   
         in a brown sack 

with stale, dry bread to toss for ducks   
    on the green-scummed lagoons,   
crackers for porcupine and fox, 
life-savers for the footpad coons   
         to scour and rinse, 

snatch after in their muddy pail   

    and stare into their paws. 
When I moved next door to the jail   
         I learned to fry 
omelettes and griddlecakes so I 

could set you supper at my table.   
As I built back from helplessness,   
         when I grew able, 
the only possible answer was   
    you had to come here less. 

This Hallowe'en you come one week.   
         You masquerade 
    as a vermilion, sleek, 
fat, crosseyed fox in the parade   
or, where grim jackolanterns leer, 

go with your bag from door to door   
foraging for treats. How queer: 
    when you take off your mask 
my neighbors must forget and ask 
         whose child you are. 

Of course you lose your appetite,   
    whine and won't touch your plate;   
         as local law 
I set your place on an orange crate   
in your own room for days. At night 

you lie asleep there on the bed   
         and grate your jaw. 
Assuredly your father's crimes   
         are visited 
on you. You visit me sometimes. 

The time's up. Now our pumpkin sees   
    me bringing your suitcase. 
         He holds his grin; 
the forehead shrivels, sinking in. 
You break this year's first crust of snow 

off the runningboard to eat. 
    We manage, though for days 
I crave sweets when you leave and know   
they rot my teeth. Indeed our sweet 
         foods leave us cavities. 


    I get numb and go in 
though the dry ground will not hold 
    the few dry swirls of snow   
and it must not be very cold.   
A friend asks how you've been 
         and I don't know 

    or see much right to ask. 
Or what use it could be to know. 
    In three months since you came   
the leaves have fallen and the snow;   
your pictures pinned above my desk 
         seem much the same. 

    Somehow I come to find 
myself upstairs in the third floor   
    museum's halls, 
walking to kill my time once more   
among the enduring and resigned   
         stuffed animals, 

    where, through a century's 
caprice, displacement and 
    known treachery between 
its wars, they hear some old command   
and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze   
         to this still scene, 

    Nature Morte. Here 
by the door, its guardian, 
    the patchwork dodo stands 
where you and your stepsister ran   
laughing and pointing. Here, last year,   
         you pulled my hands 

    and had your first, worst quarrel,   
so toys were put up on your shelves.   
    Here in the first glass cage 
the little bobcats arch themselves,   
still practicing their snarl 
         of constant rage. 

    The bison, here, immense,   
shoves at his calf, brow to brow,   
    and looks it in the eye 
to see what is it thinking now.   
I forced you to obedience; 
         I don't know why. 

    Still the lean lioness 
beyond them, on her jutting ledge   
    of shale and desert shrub, 
stands watching always at the edge,   
stands hard and tanned and envious   
         above her cub; 

    with horns locked in tall heather,   
two great Olympian Elk stand bound,   
    fixed in their lasting hate 
till hunger brings them both to ground.   
Whom equal weakness binds together   
    none shall separate. 

    Yet separate in the ocean 
of broken ice, the white bear reels 
    beyond the leathery groups   
of scattered, drab Arctic seals   
arrested here in violent motion 
    like Napoleon's troops. 

    Our states have stood so long 
at war, shaken with hate and dread,   
    they are paralyzed at bay; 
once we were out of reach, we said,   
we would grow reasonable and strong.   
         Some other day. 

    Like the cold men of Rome, 
we have won costly fields to sow 
    in salt, our only seed.   
Nothing but injury will grow. 
I write you only the bitter poems 
         that you can't read. 

    Onan who would not breed 
a child to take his brother's bread   
    and be his brother's birth, 
rose up and left his lawful bed,   
went out and spilled his seed   
         in the cold earth. 

    I stand by the unborn, 
by putty-colored children curled 
    in jars of alcohol, 
that waken to no other world,   
unchanging, where no eye shall mourn.   
         I see the caul 

    that wrapped a kitten, dead. 
I see the branching, doubled throat   
    of a two-headed foal; 
I see the hydrocephalic goat; 
here is the curled and swollen head,   
         there, the burst skull; 

    skin of a limbless calf; 
a horse's foetus, mummified; 
    mounted and joined forever,   
the Siamese twin dogs that ride   
belly to belly, half and half, 
         that none shall sever. 

    I walk among the growths, 
by gangrenous tissue, goiter, cysts,   
    by fistulas and cancers, 
where the malignancy man loathes   
is held suspended and persists. 
         And I don't know the answers. 

    The window's turning white. 
The world moves like a diseased heart   
    packed with ice and snow. 
Three months now we have been apart   
less than a mile. I cannot fight 
         or let you go. 


The vicious winter finally yields   
    the green winter wheat; 
the farmer, tired in the tired fields   
    he dare not leave, will eat. 

Once more the runs come fresh; prevailing   
    piglets, stout as jugs, 
harry their old sow to the railing 
    to ease her swollen dugs 

and game colts trail the herded mares 
    that circle the pasture courses;   
our seasons bring us back once more 
    like merry-go-round horses. 

With crocus mouths, perennial hungers,   
    into the park Spring comes; 
we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers 
    and feed the swan bread crumbs, 

pay our respects to the peacocks, rabbits,   
    and leathery Canada goose 
who took, last Fall, our tame white habits   
    and now will not turn loose. 

In full regalia, the pheasant cocks 
    march past their dubious hens; 
the porcupine and the lean, red fox 
    trot around bachelor pens 

and the miniature painted train   
    wails on its oval track: 
you said, I'm going to Pennsylvania!   
    and waved. And you've come back. 

If I loved you, they said I'd leave   
    and find my own affairs. 
Well, once again this April, we've   
    come around to the bears; 

punished and cared for, behind bars, 
    the coons on bread and water 
stretch thin black fingers after ours. 
    And you are still my daughter.

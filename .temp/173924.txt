 
Tell me not (Sweet) I am unkind, 
         That from the nunnery 
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind 
         To war and arms I fly. 

True, a new mistress now I chase, 
         The first foe in the field; 
And with a stronger faith embrace 
         A sword, a horse, a shield. 

Yet this inconstancy is such 
         As you too shall adore; 
I could not love thee (Dear) so much, 
         Lov'd I not Honour more.

 
Retired ballerinas on winter afternoons   
          walking their dogs 
                      in Central Park West 
    (or their cats on leashes-- 
       the cats themselves old highwire artists)   
The ballerinas 
                leap and pirouette 
                           through Columbus Circle   
         while winos on park benches 
               (laid back like drunken Goudonovs)   
            hear the taxis trumpet together 
               like horsemen of the apocalypse   
                               in the dusk of the gods   
It is the final witching hour 
                when swains are full of swan songs   
    And all return through the dark dusk   
                to their bright cells 
                                  in glass highrises 
      or sit down to oval cigarettes and cakes   
                              in the Russian Tea Room   
    or climb four flights to back rooms 
                                 in Westside brownstones   
               where faded playbill photos 
                        fall peeling from their frames   
                            like last year's autumn leaves

White grave goddess,   

Pity my sadness,   

O silence of Paros. 



I am not of these about thy feet,   

These garments and decorum;   

I am thy brother,   

Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,   

And thou hearest me not. 



I have whispered thee in thy solitudes   

Of our loves in Phrygia,   

The far ecstasy of burning noons   

When the fragile pipes   

Ceased in the cypress shade,   

And the brown fingers of the shepherd   

Moved over slim shoulders;   

And only the cicada sang. 



I have told thee of the hills 

And the lisp of reeds 

And the sun upon thy breasts, 



And thou hearest me not,   

Potuia, potuia 

Thou hearest me not.

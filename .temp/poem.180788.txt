A ward, and still in bonds, one day
         I stole abroad;
It was high spring, and all the way
    Primrosed and hung with shade;
    Yet was it frost within,
         And surly winds
Blasted my infant buds, and sin
    Like clouds eclipsed my mind.

Stormed thus, I straight perceived my spring
         Mere stage and show,
My walk a monstrous, mountained thing,
    Roughcast with rocks and snow;
    And as a pilgrim's eye,
         Far from relief,
Measures the melancholy sky,
    Then drops and rains for grief,

So sighed I upwards still; at last
         'Twixt steps and falls
I reached the pinnacle, where placed
    I found a pair of scales;
    I took them up and laid
         In th' one, late pains;
The other smoke and pleasures weighed,
    But proved the heavier grains.

With that some cried, "Away!" Straight I
         Obeyed, and led
Full east, a fair, fresh field could spy;
    Some called it Jacob's bed,
    A virgin soil which no
         Rude feet ere trod,
Where, since he stepped there, only go
    Prophets and friends of God.

Here I reposed; but scarce well set,
         A grove descried
Of stately height, whose branches met
    And mixed on every side;
    I entered, and once in,
         Amazed to see 't,
Found all was changed, and a new spring
    Did all my senses greet.

The unthrift sun shot vital gold,
         A thousand pieces,
And heaven its azure did unfold,
    Checkered with snowy fleeces;
    The air was all in spice,
         And every bush
A garland wore; thus fed my eyes,
    But all the ear lay hush.

Only a little fountain lent
         Some use for ears,
And on the dumb shades language spent
    The music of her tears;
    I drew her near, and found
         The cistern full
Of divers stones, some bright and round,
    Others ill-shaped and dull.

The first, pray mark, as quick as light
         Danced through the flood,
But the last, more heavy than the night,
    Nailed to the center stood;
    I wondered much, but tired
         At last with thought,
My restless eye that still desired
    As strange an object brought.

It was a bank of flowers, where I descried
         Though 'twas midday,
Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed
    And taking in the ray;
    Here, musing long, I heard
         A rushing wind
Which still increased, but whence it stirred
    No where I could not find.

I turned me round, and to each shade
         Dispatched an eye
To see if any leaf had made 
    Least motion or reply,
    But while I listening sought
         My mind to ease
By knowing where 'twas, or where not,
    It whispered, "Where I please."

"Lord," then said I, "on me one breath,
And let me die before my death!"

Arise O North, and come thou South-wind and blow upon my garden, that
 the spices thereof may flow out.

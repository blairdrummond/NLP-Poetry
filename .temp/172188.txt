 
For Harvey Shapiro
I stand and listen, head bowed,   
to my inner complaint. 
Persons passing by think 
I am searching for a lost coin.   
You're fired, I yell inside 
after an especially bad episode.   
I'm letting you go without notice   
or terminal pay. You just lost   
another chance to make good. 
But then I watch myself standing at the exit,   
depressed and about to leave,   
and wave myself back in wearily,   
for who else could I get in my place   
to do the job in dark, airless conditions?

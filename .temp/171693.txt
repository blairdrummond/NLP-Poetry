 
On the first page of my dreambook 
It's always evening 
In an occupied country.   
Hour before the curfew.   
A small provincial city.   
The houses all dark. 
The storefronts gutted. 

I am on a street corner   
Where I shouldn't be.   
Alone and coatless 
I have gone out to look 
For a black dog who answers to my whistle.   
I have a kind of Halloween mask 
Which I am afraid to put on.

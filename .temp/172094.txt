 
To Marc Crawford from whom the commission
Whose broken window is a cry of art   
(success, that winks aware 
as elegance, as a treasonable faith) 
is raw: is sonic: is old-eyed premiere. 
Our beautiful flaw and terrible ornament.   
Our barbarous and metal little man. 

"I shall create! If not a note, a hole.   
If not an overture, a desecration." 

Full of pepper and light 
and Salt and night and cargoes. 

"Don't go down the plank 
if you see there's no extension.   
Each to his grief, each to 
his loneliness and fidgety revenge. 
Nobody knew where I was and now I am no longer there." 

The only sanity is a cup of tea.   
The music is in minors. 

Each one other 
is having different weather. 

"It was you, it was you who threw away my name!   
And this is everything I have for me." 

Who has not Congress, lobster, love, luau,   
the Regency Room, the Statue of Liberty,   
runs. A sloppy amalgamation. 
A mistake. 
A cliff. 
A hymn, a snare, and an exceeding sun.

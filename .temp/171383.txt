 
The eager note on my door said "Call me,   
call when you get in!" so I quickly threw   
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,   
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and 

headed straight for the door. It was autumn   
by the time I got around the corner, oh all 
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but   
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk! 

Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late   
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a   
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!   
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was 

there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that 
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few   
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest   
only casually invited, and that several months ago.

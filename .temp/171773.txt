 
I wore a garland of the briar that put me now in awe   

I wore a garland of the brain that was whole   

It commanded me, done babbling 

And I no more blabbed, spare no lie 

Tell womanhood she shake off pity 

Tell the man to give up tumult for the while   

To wonder at the sight of baby's beauty 

Ne let the monsters fray us with things that not be   

From a high tower poem issuing 

Everything run along in creation till I end the song   

Ne none fit for so wild beasts 

Ne none so joyous, ne none no give no lie 

Tell old woes to leave off here: 

I sing this into a scallop shell with face of a pearl   

& leave all sorrow bye & bye.

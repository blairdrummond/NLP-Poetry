 
Each could picture probably 
with great care his brother drawing   
the corded string of a watered silk bag 
and mumbling to Basho above the keepsake   
pay your respects to mother's white hair   
now your eyebrows look a little white too 
but all have turned instead to watch this child   
a girl my daughter Simone 
an astute migrant 
skimming the stream of days 
toted wherever she wants 
to eat the dirt of inattentive towns   
to arm wrestle as with 
the blind & steal a stoic 
shipping him home-- 
all have turned & run to her because   
she has a spider on her neck she has   
seen herself 
though blindfolded by a cloud 
the sun is a yellowjacket 
drowning in a cup of coffee she carries   
a spider in her hair 
blond & blonder dear river.

 
At dawn wind out of the north, hailflecks, pebbly 
skates against windows. I lie thinking
the drainspout's drip comes 
again in the basement
faucet where I am crying, 
a child betrayed by death's 
new cardinal and the cat 
yawning on the porch
where my grandmother found me.

Risen now, I see the river full-bodied, its white 
wind-knotted hair swirling like hers.
The polar hickory is naked 
as a saber recalled by a girl 
long gone in the gold
sauce of apples.
Two leaves that might be 
cardinals returned
tumble in the hard light 
at the brick fence.
Nothing moves in boxwood 
where gray soldiers lie.

Among the last of them she walked, cupping apples, 
staining her white frock, who took
a boy far back into the haze 
the Shenandoah hills held 
where family stallions
might walk aimless ground 
littered with purpling flesh 
beyond the cull of seasons. 
Through a gate nailed
with leather belts
in my mind, I pass and enter 
the arthritic orchard
tended by widows. What
I gather wakes me to think

how bright on the tongue was the taste kept 
concealed, sustained, of flesh 
abiding, months beneath 
the wintering house floors. 
To reach this I must go 
down storm-worn stones 
and pick my steps past
the sealed boxes of family 
debris, nightgowns, flannels, 
ribbons, birthspoons, a pair 
of dulled skates, flowers 
pressed in a moldy Bible.

Why is it we keep what we cannot bear
to use, and can't escape, shoving
ourselves into shrunken rooms
edged with old foolishness 
unforgiven and unforgotten? 
I fumble to the center 
and pull a yellow light 
down the ancient string 
still dependably there 
and stand, in my head, 
as she did, playfully 
asking where they went. 
I know, I know, I say 
back there in the dust 
where I've come again
to look through tiny windows
into skirts of boxwood, a morning

that sends me alive among gray soldiers 
at the house roots. I see also blue 
preserving jars full of slick
pulpy flesh she has put up
in a juice thick as blood.
Behind it all in dark eaves,
baskets of apples, split
pine boxes like generations 
steeping, undisturbed
by the tick and groan
of housepipes veining
the overhead I leave. Oh 
let me see her light bring 
back those stallion-feeders, 
little red handfuls of joy! Look

how long I've slept, learning to walk 
straight into a dawn-silvered web 
where secret spiders spin 
ceaseless as the seasons. 
Above me ice takes each 
room, I can hear feet 
pacing fretful halls,
yet here I lift my face 
and puff back all the silk 
in the world. I hold every 
core peeled on this slab. 
My fingers claw the meat 
of family stillness,
parting all the way to seeds.

Oh widows of the air,
fill me with your
cidery, useless lying,
those bladed hours
you fed me the dark
rotting dreams of your love.

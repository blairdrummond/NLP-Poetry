 
A man walks beside them   
with a whip that he cracks.   
The cart they draw is painted   
with Saracens and Crusaders, 
fierce eyes and ranks of spears. 

They are on the steep road   
that goes up the mountain.   
Their neat-stepping hoofs   
appear to be flickering   
in the sun, raising dust. 

They are higher than the roofs 
on which striped gourds and melons   
lie ripening. They move 
among the dark green olives 
that grow on the rocks. 

they dwindle as they climb ...   
vanish around a corner 
and reappear walking on the edge   
of a precipice. They enter 
the region of mist and darkness. 

I think I can see them still:   
a pair of yoked oxen 
the color of ivory 
or smoke, with red tassels,   
in the gathering dusk.

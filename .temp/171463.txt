 
Yo ave del agua floreciente duro en fiesta.   --"Deseo de persistencia," Poesia Nahuatl


In the region of rain and cloud, 
I live in shade, 
under the moss mat of days bruised 
                        purple with desire. 
My dominion is a song in the wide ring of water.   
There, I run to and fro, 
braiding the logical act 
            in the birth of an Ear of Corn,   
polychromatic story I will now tell 
in the weaving, power's form in motion, 
a devotion to the unstressed. 
Once, I wreathed around a king, 
became a fishing net, a maze 
               "a deadly wealth of robe." 
Mothers who have heard me sing take heart;   
I always prick them into power.

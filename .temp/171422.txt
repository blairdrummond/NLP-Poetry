 
Long scree of pill bottles 
         spilling over the tipped brim   
of the wicker basket, fifty or more,   
         a hundred, 

your name on every one and under 
         your name the brusque rune of instructions-- 
which ones to take, how many, and often, 
         on what days, 

with or without food, before or 
         after eating, impossible 
toward the end to keep them all straight,   
         not even 

with your charts, your calendars, the bottles   
         ranged in sequence along the kitchen   
counter--you always so 
         efficient, 

organized, never without a plan, 
         even when planning had come down   
to this and nothing more, for there was   
         still a future 

in it, though the future reached 
         only from one bottle to 
the next, from pill to pill, each one 
         another 

toehold giving way 
         beneath you on the steep slope   
you never stopped struggling against,   
         unable not 

to climb, and then, when climbing 
         was impossible, not to try slowing   
the quickening descent. You had 
         descended now, 

your body thinned to the machine 
         of holding on, while I exhausted   
by the vigil, with all your medicine 
         spread before me, 

looked for something, anything 
         at all to help me sleep.   
To help me for a short while anyway 
         not be 

aware of you, your gaunt hand 
         clutching the guardrail, your eyes   
blind, flitting, scanning, it seemed,   
         the air above them 

for their own sight, and the whimper   
         far back in the throat, the barely   
audible continuous 
         half-cry half- 

wheeze I couldn't hear and not think 
         you were saying something, though   
I couldn't make out what. I wanted 
         to sleep, 

I wanted if just for that one night 
         to meet you there on that steep slope,   
the two of us together, facing 
         opposite 

directions, I, because I wasn't 
         dying, looking down, desiring   
what you, still looking up, resisted,   
         because you were.

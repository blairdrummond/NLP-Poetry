 
Two hands lie still, the hairy and the white, 
And soon down ladders of reflected light 
The sleepers climb in silence. Gradually 
They separate on paths of long ago,
Each winding on his arm the unpleasant clew 
That leads, live as a nerve, to memory.

But often when too steep her dream descends, 
Perhaps to the grotto where her father bends 
To pick her up, the husband wakes as though 
He had forgotten something in the house. 
Motionless he eyes the room that glows 
With the little animals of light that prowl

This way and that. Soft are the beasts of light 
But softer still her hand that drifts so white 
Upon the whiteness. How like a water-plant 
It floats upon the black canal of sleep, 
Suspended upward from the distant deep 
In pure achievement of its lovely want!

Quietly then he plucks it and it folds
And is again a hand, small as a child's.
He would revive it but it barely stirs
And so he carries it off a little way
And breaks it open gently. Now he can see 
The sweetness of the fruit, his hand eats hers.

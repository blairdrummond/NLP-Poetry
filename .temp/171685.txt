 
With only his dim lantern   
To tell him where he is 
And every time a mountain   
Of fresh corpses to load up 

Take them to the other side 
Where there are plenty more 
I'd say by now he must be confused   
As to which side is which 

I'd say it doesn't matter 
No one complains he's got 
Their pockets to go through 
In one a crust of bread in another a sausage 

Once in a long while a mirror   
Or a book which he throws   
Overboard into the dark river   
Swift and cold and deep

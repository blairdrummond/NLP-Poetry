 
To tell the truth, those brick Housing Authority buildings   
For whose loveliness no soul had planned, 
Like random dominoes stood, worn out and facing each other,   
Creating the enclosure that was our home. 

Long basement corridors connected one house to another   
And had a special smell, from old bicycles and baby carriages   
In the storage rooms. The elevators 
Were used by kissing teenagers. 

The playground--iron swingchains, fences, iron monkey bars,   
Iron seesaw handles, doubtless now rusted-- 
Left a strong iron smell on my hands and in the autumn air   
And rang with cries. To me it is even precious 

Where they chased the local Mongoloid, yelling "Stupid Joey! Stupid Joey!" 
Now I've said everything nice I can about this.

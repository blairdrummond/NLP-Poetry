 
The unclean spirits cry out in the body 
Or mind of the guest Ellen in a loud voice 
Torment me not, and in the fury of her unclean 
Hands beating the air in some kind of unending torment-- 
Nobody witnessing could possibly know the event   
That cast upon her the spell of this enchantment. 

Almost all the guests are under some kind of enchantment:   
Of being poor day after day in the same body; 
Of being witness still to some obscene event; 
Of listening all the time to somebody's voice 
Whispering in the ear things divine or unclean, 
In the quotidian of unending torment. 

One has to keep thinking there was some source of torment,   
Something that happened someplace else, unclean.   
One has to keep talking in a reasonable voice 
About things done, say, by a father's body 
To or upon the body of Ellen, in enchantment 
Helpless, still by the unforgotten event 

Enchanted, still in the old forgotten event 
A prisoner of love, filthy Ellen in her torment,   
Guest Ellen in the dining hall in her body, 
Hands beating the air in her enchantment,   
Sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled voice   
The narrative of the spirits of the unclean. 

She is wholly the possessed one of the unclean. 
Maybe the spirits came from the river. The enchantment   
Entered her, maybe, in the Northeast Kingdom. The torment,   
A thing of the waters, gratuitous event, 
Came up out of the waters and entered her body 
And lived in her in torment and cried out in her voice. 

It speaks itself over and over again in her voice,   
Cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene event   
Or only the pure event of original enchantment   
From the birth of the river waters, the pure unclean   
Rising from the source of things, in a figure of torment   
Seeking out Ellen, finding its home in her poor body. 

Her body witness is, so also is her voice,   
Of torment coming from unknown event; 
Unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment.

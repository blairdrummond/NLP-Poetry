 
Pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded 
In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there, 
Warm from a woman's soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing. 
Where is she, the woman who wore it? The scent of her lingers and drugs me. 
A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down on my face, 
And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens. 
Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement. 
Rose-leaves blow and patter against it. Below the stone steps a lute tinkles. 
A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. A big-bellied 
Frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin, 
Sunk in the black and white marble. The west wind has lifted a scarf 
On the seat close beside me; the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour. 
She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight stirring. 
Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel 
Hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to a handful of cinders, 
And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine. 

How loud clocks can tick when a room is empty, and one is alone!

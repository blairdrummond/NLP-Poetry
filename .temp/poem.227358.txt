A little East of Jordan, 
Evangelists record, 
A Gymnast and an Angel 
Did wrestle long and hard - 

Till morning touching mountain - 
And Jacob, waxing strong, 
The Angel begged permission 
To Breakfast - to return! 

Not so, said cunning Jacob! 
"I will not let thee go 
Except thou bless me" - Stranger! 
The which acceded to - 

Light swung the silver fleeces 
"Peniel" Hills beyond, 
And the bewildered Gymnast 
Found he had worsted God!

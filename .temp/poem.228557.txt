Rarely, rarely, comest thou,
         Spirit of Delight!
Wherefore hast thou left me now
         Many a day and night?
Many a weary night and day
'Tis since thou are fled away.

How shall ever one like me
         Win thee back again?
With the joyous and the free
         Thou wilt scoff at pain.
Spirit false! thou hast forgot
All but those who need thee not.

As a lizard with the shade
         Of a trembling leaf,
Thou with sorrow art dismay'd;
         Even the sighs of grief
Reproach thee, that thou art not near,
And reproach thou wilt not hear.

Let me set my mournful ditty
         To a merry measure;
Thou wilt never come for pity,
         Thou wilt come for pleasure;
Pity then will cut away
Those cruel wings, and thou wilt stay.

I love all that thou lovest,
         Spirit of Delight!
The fresh Earth in new leaves dress'd,
         And the starry night;
Autumn evening, and the morn
When the golden mists are born.

I love snow, and all the forms
         Of the radiant frost;
I love waves, and winds, and storms,
         Everything almost
Which is Nature's, and may be
Untainted by man's misery.

I love tranquil solitude,
         And such society
As is quiet, wise, and good;
         Between thee and me
What difference? but thou dost possess
The things I seek, not love them less.

I love Love?though he has wings,
         And like light can flee,
But above all other things,
         Spirit, I love thee?
Thou art love and life! Oh come,
Make once more my heart thy home.

 
Hair still Titian, 
but Botticelli's grip has loosened-- 

not now Rubenesque,    
and probably never; 

Ingres approaches,    
but Courbet might capture me. 

Could I be surreal? 
It seems almost likely-- 

bells in my ears 
and fortresses under; 

cones have been set on my eyes. 
My spring is gone 

and summer's upon me, 
rude in its ripening. 

I'm espaliered, strung wide and tied,    
pinioned, and thus can I fly.

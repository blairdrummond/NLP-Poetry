Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud; 
Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud; 
Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate. 

         Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown; 
With that wild wheel we go not up or down; 
Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great. 

         Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands; 
Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands; 
For man is man and master of his fate. 

         Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd; 
Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud; 
Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

Falling leaves and falling men!
     When the snows of winter fall,
 And the winds of winter blows,
     Will be woven Nature's pall.


 Let us, then, forsake our dead;
     For the dead will surely wait
 While we rush upon the foe,
     Eager for the hero's fate.


 Leaves will come upon the trees;
     Spring will show the happy race;
 Mothers will give birth to sons--
     Loyal souls to fill our place.


 Wherefore should we rest and rush?
     Soldiers, we must fight and save
 Freedom now, and give our foes
     All their country should--a grave!

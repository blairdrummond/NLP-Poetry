 
You are the problem I propose, 
My dear, the text my musings glose: 
I call you for convenience love. 
By definition you're a cause 
Inferred by necessary laws-- 
You are so to the saints above. 
But in this shadowy lower life 
I sleep with a terrestrial wife 
And earthy children I beget. 
Love is a fiction I must use, 
A privilege I can abuse, 
And sometimes something I forget. 

Now, in the heavenly other place 
Love is in the eternal mind 
The luminous form whose shade she is, 
A ghost discarnate, thought defined. 
She was so to my early bliss, 
She is so while I comprehend 
The forms my senses apprehend, 
And in the end she will be so. 

Her whom my hands embrace I kiss, 
Her whom my mind infers I know. 
The one exists in time and space 
And as she was she will not be; 
The other is in her own grace 
And is She is eternally. 

Plato! you shall not plague my life. 
I married a terrestrial wife. 
And Hume! she is not mere sensation 
In sequence of observed relation. 
She has two forms--ah, thank you, Duns!--, 
I know her in both ways at once. 
I knew her, yes, before I knew her, 
And by both means I must construe her, 
And none among you shall undo her.

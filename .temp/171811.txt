 
He can only drink tea now, screwed and filed. 
She is dead, in metal flecks.

55 years old and look like a bad nail 
by God they yanked me out 
I can tell you


soon as the hurt come son shut up 
it don't mean nothing


but listen: you got time for a ride?


Habit's put the glass in his hands, the brown 
tasteless tea, slime, and cigarettes.
Every Sunday the same, old dog
fat at his feet.

Ain't so much me I'm asking for 
dog like to get out and piss 
think they remember.


Near the main gate of Gary Steel I stop.
The amber light pours out of stacked horizons, 
monstrous cranes hang over suburbs.

She think that piss mean something 
it don't mean nothing.


Turning back in the dark, headlights flash 
on our faces, bent, light of a woman's hair.

I. THEIR BASIC SAVAGERY 

Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, 
Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, 
Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, 
Pounded on the table, 
Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom, 
Hard as they were able, 
Boom, boom, BOOM, 
With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM. 
THEN I had religion, THEN I had a vision. 
I could not turn from their revel in derision. 
THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, 
CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. 
Then along that riverbank 
A thousand miles 
Tattooed cannibals danced in files; 
Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song 
And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong. 
And "BLOOD" screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors, 
"BLOOD" screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors, 
"Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle, 
Harry the uplands, 
Steal all the cattle, 
Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, 
Bing. 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM," 
A roaring, epic, rag-time tune 
From the mouth of the Congo 
To the Mountains of the Moon. 
Death is an Elephant, 
Torch-eyed and horrible, 
Foam-flanked and terrible. 
BOOM, steal the pygmies, 
BOOM, kill the Arabs, 
BOOM, kill the white men, 
HOO, HOO, HOO. 
Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost 
Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host. 
Hear how the demons chuckle and yell 
Cutting his hands off, down in Hell. 
Listen to the creepy proclamation, 
Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation, 
Blown past the white-ants' hill of clay, 
Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play: -- 
"Be careful what you do, 
Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, 
And all of the other 
Gods of the Congo, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you."

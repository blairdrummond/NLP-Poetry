Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; 
   Where knowledge is free; 
   Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; 
   Where words come out from the depth of truth; 
   Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; 
   Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; 
   Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action 
   Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

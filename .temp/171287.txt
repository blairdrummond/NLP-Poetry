 
Coming together   
it is easier to work   
after our bodies   
meet 
paper and pen 
neither care nor profit 
whether we write or not 
but as your body moves 
under my hands   
charged and waiting   
we cut the leash 
you create me against your thighs   
hilly with images 
moving through our word countries   
my body 
writes into your flesh 
the poem 
you make of me. 

Touching you I catch midnight   
as moon fires set in my throat   
I love you flesh into blossom   
I made you 
and take you made 
into me.

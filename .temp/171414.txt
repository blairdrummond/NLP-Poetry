 
This morning, between two branches of a tree   
Beside the door, epeira once again 
Has spun and signed his tapestry and trap.   
I test his early-warning system and 
It works, he scrambles forth in sable with   
The yellow hieroglyph that no one knows   
The meaning of. And I remember now 
How yesterday at dusk the nighthawks came   
Back as they do about this time each year, 
Grey squadrons with the slashes white on wings   
Cruising for bugs beneath the bellied cloud.   
Now soon the monarchs will be drifting south,   
And then the geese will go, and then one day   
The little garden birds will not be here.   
See how many leaves already have 
Withered and turned; a few have fallen, too.   
Change is continuous on the seamless web,   
Yet moments come like this one, when you feel   
Upon your heart a signal to attend 
The definite announcement of an end 
Where one thing ceases and another starts;   
When like the spider waiting on the web   
You know the intricate dependencies   
Spreading in secret through the fabric vast   
Of heaven and earth, sending their messages   
Ciphered in chemistry to all the kinds, 
The whisper down the bloodstream: it is time.

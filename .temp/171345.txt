 
Beside the highway, the Giant Slide 
with its rusty undulations lifts 
out of the weeds. It hasn't been used   
for a generation. The ticket booth 
tilts to that side where the nickels shifted   
over the years. A chain link fence keeps out   
the children and drunks. Blue morning glories   
climb halfway up the stairs, bright clusters   
of laughter. Call it a passing fancy, 
this slide that nobody slides down now.   
Those screams have all gone east 
on a wind that will never stop blowing   
down from the Rockies and over the plains,   
where things catch on for a little while,   
bright leaves in a fence, and then are gone.

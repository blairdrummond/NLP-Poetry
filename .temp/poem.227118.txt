   Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's
Silent music, either other
          Sweetly gracing.

   Lovely forms do flow
From concent divinely framed;
Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's
          Birth is heavenly.

   These dull notes we sing
Discords need for helps to grace them;
Only beauty purely loving
          Knows no discord,

But still moves delight,
Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,
Ever perfect, ever in them-
          Selves eternal.

 
There are so many roots to the tree of anger   
that sometimes the branches shatter   
before they bear. 

Sitting in Nedicks 
the women rally before they march   
discussing the problematic girls   
they hire to make them free. 
An almost white counterman passes   
a waiting brother to serve them first   
and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
the slighter pleasures of their slavery.   
But I who am bound by my mirror   
as well as my bed 
see causes in colour 
as well as sex 

and sit here wondering   
which me will survive   
all these liberations.

Over there, trees are sheltering
 A hunchedback hut... A slum, no more...
 Roof askew, walls and wainscoting
 Falling away... Moss hides the door.


 Only one shutter, hanging... But
 Seeping over the windowsill,
 Like frosted breath, proof that this hut,
 This slum, is living, breathing still.


 Corkscrew of smoke... A wisp of blue
 Escapes the hovel, whose soul it is...
 Rises to God himself, and who
 Receives the news and makes it his.

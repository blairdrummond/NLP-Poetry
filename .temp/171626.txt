 
Amidst the too much that we buy and throw   
away and the far too much we wrap it in,   
the bear found a few items of special 
interest--a honeydew rind, a used tampon,   
the bone from a leg of lamb. He'd rock back   
lightly onto his rear paws and slash 
open a plastic bag, and then his nose-- 
jammed almost with a surfeit of rank 
and likely information, for he would pause-- 
and then his whole dowsing snout would   
insinuate itself a little way 
inside. By now he'd have hunched his weight   
forward slightly, and then he'd snatch it back,   
trailed by some tidbit in his teeth. He'd look   
around. What a good boy am he. 
The guardian of the dump was used 
to this and not amused. "He'll drag that shit   
every which damn way," he grumbled 
who'd dozed and scraped a pit to keep that shit   
where the town paid to contain it. 
The others of us looked and looked. "City   
folks like you don't get to see this often,"   
one year-round resident accused me. 
Some winter I'll bring him down to learn   
to love a rat working a length of subway   
track. "Nope," I replied. Just then the bear   
decamped for the woods with a marl of grease   
and slather in his mouth and on his snout,   
picking up speed, not cute (nor had he been   
cute before, slavering with greed, his weight   
all sunk to his seated rump and his nose stuck   
up to sift the rich and fetid air, shaped   
like a huge, furry pear), but richly 
fed on the slow-simmering dump, and gone   
into the bug-thick woods and anecdote.

Count sentences per line, length of line, length of sentence. 
Problems: sentences that wander across multiple lines?


  "Well yes, we're counting sentence endings, right!  
  And yes, we're measuring that against lie breaks and stanza breaks. 
  But we're also interested in the number of sentences per line and stanza. 
  There could be for instance several sentences per line which is indicative of certain stylistic features 
  (directness; or alert tone, etc.) 
  or movements within the poem
  (sections with higher dynamics, or urgency of speech, etc.),
  or the opposite, long sentences unfurling across many lines and even stanzas. 
  We are therefore interested in the number of sentences per poem as well and in their lengths.
  And of course their syntactic anatomy 
  (which will be of course easier to analyze in the shorter ones). "

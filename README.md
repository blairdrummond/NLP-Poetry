# NLP-Poetry
Syntactic Analysis of a corpus of poems

A work in progress conducting a syntactic analysis of a corpora of poems as a part of an UROP project (Undergraduate Research Opprotunity Program),from the University Of Ottawa,
It is also a component of a larger project funded by a SSHRC (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) research grant, "Poetry Computational Graphs", for which Dr. Chris Tanasescu is the Principle Investigator, and Dr. Diana Inkpen is the Co-Investigator.

************

NOTE! There may be compatibility problems between python 2 and 3. I use 'map' a lot, but in python 2 this returns a list, and in python 3 it returns an iterator. Wrapping the function in list(...) fixes the problem. I will probably update the code to python 3 in the near future.

Dependencies:

Java 8, Stanford-CoreNLP, python, nltk, zss, editdist, tkinter for python

Important Note:

the stanford core folder is missing the models.jar file, which is too large for github.
